These transport and thermal properties show anomalies at certain temperatures (T*) for x${\\\\geq}$0.08. The large thermal expansion anomalies, specific heat anomalies, and the existence of hystereses in the above measurements indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T*. Additionally, the Seebeck coefficient indicates that the anomalies at T* are related not only to the lattice system, but also to the electronic system. Superconductivity is not observed above 2 K at x=0.08, which is around the phase boundary where T* vanishes. The suppression of superconductivity around the structural phase boundary suggests a close relationship between the lattice and superconductivity.\",\n","  \"authors\": [\n","    \"Miku Sasaki\",\n","    \"Kotaro Inada\",\n","    \"Fumito Mori\",\n","    \"Takaaki Hirase\",\n","    \"Haruki Yamada\",\n","    \"Shota Shimoyama\",\n","    \"Yasushi Nakamura\",\n","    \"Tetta Nakamura\",\n","    \"Yoshiyuki Shibayama\",\n","    \"Naoki Momono\"\n","  ],\n","  \"authors_str\": \"Miku Sasaki, Kotaro Inada, Fumito Mori, Takaaki Hirase, Haruki Yamada, Shota Shimoyama, Yasushi Nakamura, Tetta Nakamura, Yoshiyuki Shibayama, Naoki Momono\",\n","  \"published\": \"2024-06-03T12:24:51+00:00\",\n","  \"updated\": \"2024-06-05T06:50:28+00:00\",\n","  \"year\": 2024,\n","  \"primary_category\": \"cond-mat.supr-con\",\n","  \"categories\": [\n","    \"cond-mat.supr-con\"\n","  ],\n","  \"pdf_url\": \"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01263v2\",\n","  \"comment\": \"11 pages, 7 figures, to appear in JPSJ\",\n","  \"journal_ref\": \"J.

The compound crystallizes in a tetragonal lattice (space group I4/mmm, a = 4.0771(1) A, c = 32.4330(6) A, and Z = 2), in which CaF2-type Eu3F4 layers and NaCl-like BiS2 bilayers stack alternately along the crystallographic c axis. There are two crystallographically distinct Eu sites, Eu(1) and Eu(2) at the Wyckoff positions 4e and 2a, respectively. Our bond-valence-sum calculation, based on the refined structural data, indicates that Eu(1) is essentially divalent, whilst Eu(2) has an average valence of +2.64(5). This anomalous Eu valence state is further confirmed and supported, respectively, by Mossbauer and magnetization measurements. The Eu3+ components donate electrons into the conduction bands that are mainly composed of Bi- 6px and 6py states. Consequently, the material itself shows metallic conduction, and superconducts at 1.5 K without extrinsic chemical doping.\",\n          \"Doped band insulators, HfNCl, WO$_3$, diamond, Bi$_2$Se$_3$, \\\\bis2 families, STO/LAO interface, gate doped SrTiO$_3$ and MoS$_2$ etc. are unusual superconductors. With an aim to build a general theory for superconductivity in doped band insulators we focuss on \\\\bis2 family, discovered by Mizuguchi et al. in 2012. While maximum Tc is only $\\\\sim$ 11 K in \\\\laofx, a number of experimental results are puzzling and anomalous; they resemble high Tc and unconventional superconductors. Using a two orbital model of Usui, Suzuki and Kuroki we show that the uniform low density free fermi sea in \\\\laofh is \\\\textit{unstable towards formation of next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bond} (charge -2e Cooper pair) and their \\\\textit{Wigner crystallization}. Instability to this novel state of matter is caused by unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsions (V $\\\\sim$ 1 eV) and a hopping pattern with sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi hopping t' $\\\\sim$ 0.88 eV, larger than nearest neighbor Bi-Bi hopping, t $\\\\sim$ 0.16 eV. Wigner crystal of Cooper pairs quantum melt for doping around x = 0.5 and stabilize certain resonating valence bond states and superconductivity. We study few variational RVB states and suggest that \\\\bis2 family members are latent high Tc superconductors, but challenged by competing orders and fragile nature of manybody states sustained by unscreened Coulomb forces. One of our superconducting state has d$_{xy}$ symmetry and a gap. We also predict 2d \\\\textit{Bose metal or vortex liquid} normal state, as charge -2e valence bonds survive in the normal state.\",\n          \"Superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were successfully grown using KI-KCl flux. The obtained single crystals were flat-shaped and their size was 500um. The structure and composition of the obtained single crystals were obtained using X-ray diffraction and X-ray spectroscopy. The lattice constants of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were evaluated to be a = 3.9672(4) A and c = 13.417(6) A, while their F/(O + F) molar ratio was approximately 0.17. The superconducting transition temperature of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was 4.8 K. This was different from the reported Sm(O,F)BiS2 with no superconducting transition above 2 K. The superconducting anisotropies of the upper critical field and effective mass model of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were estimated to be approximately 26 and 10, respectively.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"authors_str\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 121,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Masanori Nagao\",\n          \"M.

Final Verification: Data Volume and Integrity\n","As a final step, we programmatically verify the storage footprint of our new dataset. This confirms that:\n","1.  The files were physically written to the Google Drive.\n","2.  The file counts match our expected corpus size (e.g., if we processed 100 papers, we expect ~100 text files).\n","3.
