Although the in-plane Bi–Ch1 distance increases with Se substitution (Fig. 2(d)), the in-plane packing density also increases, enhancing the orbital overlap between Bi and Se.\\nAs proposed in Refs. 8 and 10, we confirm that enhancement of the in-plane chemical pressure is essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in this system.\\nFinally, we discuss the evolution of in-plane disorder induced by Se substitution.\\nOne advantage of synchrotron X-ray diffraction is the precise determination of thermal factors, which provide information on structural disorder.\\nSince superconductivity is induced in the Bi–Ch1 plane, Rietveld refinements were performed using anisotropic thermal factors for Bi and Ch1.\\nFigure 2(h) shows the Se concentration dependence of the anisotropic thermal factor U₁₁ for in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites.\\nThe U₁₁ value for Bi shows no remarkable change with increasing x, whereas U₁₁ for Ch1 exhibits a strong x dependence, decreasing with increasing Se concentration, which indicates suppression of in-plane disorder by Se substitution.\\nIn BiS₂-based compounds, large in-plane disorder has been widely observed using neutron diffraction, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy [16–20].\\nWe propose that the effect of in-plane chemical pressure on the emergence of superconductivity in Se-substituted Eu₀.₅La₀.₅FBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ is the suppression of in-plane disorder.\\nThis interpretation is consistent with extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies on BiS₂ compounds, where enhancement of the in-plane Bi–S1 bond intensity was observed due to in-plane chemical pressure generated by small rare-earth substitution in REO₀.₅F₀.₅BiS₂ [8,20].\\nBased on the present structural study of Eu₀.₅La₀.₅FBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ, we propose a relationship between local in-plane disorder, in-plane chemical pressure, and the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh₂-based superconductor family, although further local-scale and/or single-crystal structural studies are required for confirmation.\\nFig. 2 summarizes the Se concentration dependences of the structural parameters for Eu₀.₅La₀.₅FBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ: (a) lattice constant a, (b) lattice constant c, (c) Ch1–Bi–Ch1 bond angle, (d) in-plane Bi–Ch1 bond distance, (e) Bi–Ch2 bond distance, (f) inter-plane Bi–Ch1 bond distance, (g) in-plane chemical pressure, and (h) anisotropic thermal factor U₁₁ for in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites.\\nIn summary, synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction was performed for the BiS₂-based superconductor Eu₀.₅La₀.₅FBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ, in which bulk superconductivity is induced by Se substitution.\\nThe obtained structural parameters reveal four key tendencies: selective Se occupancy at the in-plane Ch1 site, direct correlation between Bi–Ch bond distances and lattice constants, enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure, and suppression of in-plane disorder by Se substitution, providing insight into the relationship between superconductivity

Bi3AgS6-type conducting layer.\\nIn this study, we have developed the La2O2Bi3AgS6-type materials by element substitutions to increase the transition temperature (Tc) and to induce bulk nature of superconductivity.\\nA resistivity anomaly observed at 180 K in La2O2Bi3AgS6 was systematically suppressed by Sn substitution for the Ag site.\\nBy the Sn substitution, Tc increased, and the shielding volume fraction estimated from magnetization measurements also increased.\\nThe highest Tc (= 2.3 K) and the highest shielding volume fraction (~20%) was observed for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6.\\nThe superconducting properties were further improved by Se substitutions for the S site.\\nBy the combinational substitutions of Sn and Se, bulk-superconducting phase of La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 with a Tc of 3.0 K (Tconset = 3.6 K) was obtained.\",\n","        \"extraction\": \"Suppression of resistivity anomaly by Sn substitution and emergence of bulk superconductivity.\\nHere we discuss the possible origin of the increase in Tc induced by Sn substitution.\\nAs revealed by the crystal structure analysis, the lattice parameters are not significantly affected by Sn substitution;\\ntherefore, the in-plane chemical pressure in the Bi–S superconducting plane—identified as a key factor for superconductivity in BiS₂-based compounds [24]—is not substantially altered, indicating that the in-plane chemical pressure effect is unlikely to be responsible for the Tc enhancement.\\nRegarding carrier concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases for x = 0.1–0.4, suggesting a small increase in electron carriers;\\nhowever, the large Tc enhancement at x = 0.4 cannot be explained solely by this modest carrier increase, since the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be minimal.\\nBased on these observations, we consider a possible relationship with charge density wave (CDW) ordering and its suppression by Sn substitution.\\nIn the ρ–T curves, an anomaly is observed in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆, similar to the normal-state resistivity anomaly reported for EuFBiS₂ (Tc = 0.3 K), which has been attributed to a CDW transition [29].\\nWe therefore propose that suppression of CDW ordering is responsible for the increased Tc in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆.\\nConsistently, the anomaly temperature T* shifts to lower temperatures with increasing Sn content and disappears at x = 0.3, while Tc reaches its maximum around x = 0.3–0.4, implying that Tc increases as T* is suppressed.\\nAlthough direct evidence of CDW states and their suppression mechanism is lacking in this system, the introduction of randomness at the M2 site by Sn substitution may effectively destabilize charge ordering.\\nBulk superconductivity in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃. As shown in the Results section, partial substitution of Se for S induces bulk superconductivity in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃.\\nDespite the low solubility limit (~5%), the lattice parameters clearly change upon Se substitution and the superconducting properties are markedly enhanced.\\nAlthough three structural models assuming Se substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites were refined, site selectivity could not be conclusively determined;\\nnevertheless, by analogy with previous BiS₂-based systems [24,32,33], we expect Se to preferentially occupy the in-plane Ch1 site.\\nBased on the established relationship between in-plane chalcogen disorder and superconductivity in BiS₂-based compounds [16,24], we infer that Se substitution suppresses in-plane disorder at the S1 site, thereby inducing bulk superconductivity.\\nSupporting this interpretation, the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient of La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃ is similar to that of Sn-substituted samples (S ≈ −25 μV/K), indicating that the emergence of bulk superconductivity arises from local structural optimization rather than changes in carrier concentration.\\nGiven the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the La₂O₂M₄S₆-type layered oxychalcogenide La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃, further material development can be anticipated within related layered oxychalcogenide superconductors.\\nRecently, Ruan et al. reported a new superconductor Bi₃O₂S₂Cl with a one-layer-type superconducting layer [34].\\nComparative schematic structures of one-layer-type (Bi₃O₂S₂Cl), two-layer-type (RE(O,F)BiS₂), and four-layer-type (La₂O₂M₄S₆-type) systems illustrate that all share similar RE₂O₂ or Bi₂O₂ blocking layers, while variations in the constituent elements of the superconducting layers allow tuning of layer thickness.\\nOn this basis, we anticipate the discovery of additional materials with these crystal structures or novel superconductors featuring different numbers of superconducting layers per unit cell.\\nMethods. Polycrystalline samples of La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆ (x = 0–0.5) and Se-substituted La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₆₋zSe_z (z = 0.3, 0.6) were synthesized by solid-state reaction.\\nStoichiometric amounts of Bi₂O₃, La₂S₃, Sn, AgO, Bi, S, and Se were mixed, pelletized, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and heated at 725 °C for 15 h;\\nfor Se-substituted samples, a controlled ramp to 725 °C over 1 h was required to suppress impurity formation.\\nSamples were reground, repelletized, and reheated under identical conditions. Phase purity and annealing conditions were verified by Cu-Kα X-ray diffraction, lattice parameters were refined using RIETAN-FP [35], and crystal structures were visualized with VESTA [36].\\nCompositions were confirmed by EDX using a Hitachi TM3030 SEM.\\nMagnetic susceptibility was measured using a SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-3), resistivity was measured by the four-terminal method using PPMS down to 0.4 K (³He probe) and 0.1 K (ADR option), and Seebeck coefficients were measured at 300 K using ZEM-3;\\nall samples are referenced by nominal composition.\"\n","      },\n","      {\n","        \"article_key\": \"ARTICLE_10\",\n","        \"identifier\": \"2001.07928v1\",\n","        \"abstract\": \"We report the Se substitution effects on the crystal structure, superconducting properties, and valence states of self-doped BiCh2-based compound CeOBiS2-xSex.\\nPolycrystalline CeOBiS2-xSex samples with x = 0–1.0 were synthesized.
