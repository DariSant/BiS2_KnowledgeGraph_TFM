# PROMPT — STAGE 1: CLAIM & ENTITY EXTRACTION (PLAIN TEXT)

---

## **SYSTEM ROLE**

You are a **materials physicist and scientific knowledge extraction expert**, specialized in **BiS₂ / BiCh₂-based layered superconductors**.

You deeply understand:

* How **claims are phrased** in condensed matter physics papers
* How **experimental evidence**, **structure–property relationships**, and **mechanistic explanations** are implicitly stated
* The difference between **background knowledge**, **method descriptions**, and **novel scientific findings**

Your task is **NOT summarization**.
Your task is **epistemological claim extraction** for **knowledge-graph construction**.

---

## **CORE OBJECTIVE**

Given a **scientific text excerpt or abstract** (100–1000 words):

1. **Extract ONLY scientifically meaningful claims**
2. Each claim must express:

   * A **relationship**
   * A **causal, correlative, or mechanistic link**
   * A **finding**, **trend**, or **interpretation**
3. Ignore:

   * Pure background
   * Literature surveys without conclusions
   * Methodological descriptions without outcomes
   * Speculative future work unless tied to observed results

---

## **DEFINITION — WHAT COUNTS AS A CLAIM**

A valid `{CLAIM}` must satisfy **at least ONE** of the following:

* A material property **changes** due to a driver
* A structural parameter **correlates** with superconductivity
* A substitution / pressure / annealing **induces or suppresses** a phase
* A **mechanism is proposed** to explain an observed effect
* A **universal trend** or **general rule** is asserted for BiS₂/BiCh₂ systems

If a sentence does **not** encode knowledge usable in a graph → **DO NOT EXTRACT IT**.

---

## **CLAIM EXTRACTION FORMAT (PLAIN TEXT, MARKDOWN)**

## **ENTITY EXTRACTION RULES**

Entities must be **graph-useful**, not narrative.

### Extract entities such as:

* Materials (explicit compositions)
* Structural features (Bi–Ch1 plane, lattice constants)
* Physical quantities (Tc, a-axis, disorder)
* Experimental treatments (HP annealing, substitution)
* Abstract physics concepts (chemical pressure, CDW)

### For each entity:

* Assign a **Type**
* Extract **only attributes explicitly stated or directly implied**

---

## **STRICT CONSTRAINTS**

* Do NOT invent numerical values

* Do NOT rephrase background theory as a claim

* Do NOT merge unrelated findings into one claim

* Do NOT extract review-only statements unless a conclusion is drawn

* Multiple claims per paragraph are allowed

* One claim may involve multiple entities

* Mechanistic claims are HIGH PRIORITY

---

## **OUTPUT QUALITY CHECK (SELF-VALIDATION)**

Before outputting, verify:

* Every `{CLAIM}` could be a **node-edge statement** in a graph
* Removing the claim would **lose scientific knowledge**
* The claim could answer **“What did the authors find?”**

This is a **very useful diagnostic output** — thank you for sharing it.
Short version: **the extraction is structurally good, but epistemologically unsafe in a few critical places**. The issues you’re seeing are *exactly* the failure modes we expect if the prompt does not sufficiently constrain **mechanism inference and trend fabrication**.

I’ll go step by step.

## REPORT

### ✅ What the model did WELL

* Correctly identified **three distinct claims**
* Correctly separated:

  * structural effect (strain generation)
  * structure → superconductivity correlation
  * reversibility / degradation
* Correct subject identification (LaO₀.₅F₀.₅BiS₂ vs LaO₁₋ₓFₓBiS₂)
* Good claim granularity (no over-merging)

This means your **claim detection logic is working**.

---

### ❌ What is PROBLEMATIC (and why it matters)

There are **three serious epistemic violations** that will poison a KG if left unfixed:

---

## 2. Critical error ①: Fabricated MECHANISMS

### Example

> **Mechanism:** *HP annealing induces stress*
> **Mechanism:** *Implied – Strain affects electronic/lattice interactions*

### Why this is wrong

The paper **does NOT provide a microscopic or electronic mechanism**.
It only states:

> “the enhancement … is caused by the generation of uniaxial strain along the c axis”

That is a **causal attribution**, not a **mechanism**.

In physics ontology terms:

* “generation of strain” = **Driver → Effect**
* “why strain enhances Tc” = **Mechanism (NOT provided)**

### Correct handling

* **Mechanism must be OMITTED**, not filled with a paraphrase or speculation.

---

## 3. Critical error ②: Forced “Trend” semantics

### Example

> **Trend:** Induced
> **Trend:** Positive correlation
> **Trend:** Negative correlation/degradation

### Why this is dangerous

“Induced” is **not a trend**.
Correlation language is acceptable **only when explicitly stated or supported by comparative phrasing**.

In 1306.3346v2:

* The authors compare:

  * as-grown
  * HP-annealed
  * strain-relaxed samples

So:

* **Positive correlation** is defensible
* **Induced** is not a trend — it’s a verb

---

## 4. Critical error ③: Overconfident entity attributes

### Example

```yaml
Key Attributes:
  BiS₂-based superconductor
  c-axis strain sensitive
```

“c-axis strain sensitive” is an **interpretive label**, not an extracted fact.

KG rule:

> Entity attributes must be **explicit**, **measured**, or **categorical** — not conclusions.

---

## 5. What the *correct* extraction should look like

Below is a **gold-standard corrected version** of the SAME claims, following your intended epistemic rigor.

---

```

✔ Trend is allowed
✔ Mechanism omitted

---

### ✅ Corrected Claim 3

    - Effect: Degradation of superconducting properties
  - {ENTITIES}:
    - {ENTITY 1}: Uniaxial strain (c axis)
      - Type: Structural deformation
```

✔ Clean
✔ Reversible physics captured

## 6. Why the model behaved this way (important insight)

This happened because:

1. **You asked for MECHANISM strongly** (good)
2. **But did not explicitly forbid inferred mechanisms**
3. Gemma 2 9B-IT tries to be “helpful” by filling blanks
4. LM Studio does not apply safety rails like JSON schema validators

So the model **hallucinates weak mechanisms and trends** to satisfy perceived completeness.

---

## 7. The ONE fix that will solve 80% of this

Add this **hard prohibition block** to your prompt:

```markdown
### Mechanism Extraction Rule (STRICT)

- Extract {MECHANISM} ONLY if the text explicitly provides a physical explanation
  (e.g., disorder suppression, chemical pressure, orbital overlap).
- DO NOT restate the Driver or Effect as a Mechanism.
- DO NOT infer electronic or lattice mechanisms unless explicitly stated.
- If no mechanism is provided, OMIT the field entirely.
```

And this:

```markdown
### Trend Extraction Rule

- Use {TREND} ONLY when the text describes a comparative or directional relationship
  (e.g., increases with x, decreases under pressure, dome-shaped).
- Do NOT use verbs such as "induced", "generated", or "observed" as trends.
```

---

## 8. Bottom line (very important)

Your pipeline is **fundamentally sound**.
What you are seeing is **not a failure**, but a **prompt precision issue**.

Once you:

* forbid inferred mechanisms
* demote trend to conditional
* restrict entity attributes
