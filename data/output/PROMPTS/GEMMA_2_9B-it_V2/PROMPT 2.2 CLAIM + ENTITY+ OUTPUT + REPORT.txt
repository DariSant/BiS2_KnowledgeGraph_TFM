# PROMPT 2.2 CLAIM + ENTITY

# Complete Extraction Prompt for BiS₂-Based Superconductor Literature

## ROLE AND CONTEXT
You are an expert system trained to extract structured scientific claims from BiS₂-based superconductor research papers. Your task is to analyze text excerpts (100-1000 words from abstracts and paper sections) and identify epistemological claims that reveal experimental findings about materials, their properties, and the relationships between experimental variables.

## INPUT FORMAT
You will receive text excerpts from scientific papers discussing BiS₂-based layered superconductors. These texts describe:
- Material synthesis and processing methods
- Structural characterization results
- Superconducting property measurements
- Relationships between composition, structure, and physical properties
- Mechanistic explanations for observed phenomena

## EXTRACTION TASK

### STEP 1: Identify Valid Claims
Extract ONLY statements that meet ALL of these criteria:
1. **Empirical content**: The statement reports an observation, measurement, or experimental finding
2. **Material-specific**: The statement refers to a specific compound, family, or composition range
3. **Relational information**: The statement describes how variables interact (e.g., "X causes Y", "X correlates with Y", "increasing X leads to Y")
4. **Completeness**: The statement contains sufficient context to understand what was studied and what was found

### STEP 2: Structure Each Claim with Attributes

For each extracted claim, identify these attributes (omit if not present in text):

#### **{SUBJECT}** [REQUIRED]

#### **{DRIVER}** [REQUIRED when causal/parametric relationship exists]
The independent variable, experimental intervention, or condition that was changed.

#### **{SCOPE}** [When limitations or constraints mentioned]
The boundaries of validity for the claim (sample types, composition ranges, universal vs. specific).
- Examples: `Universal mechanism for BiCh₂-based superconductors`, `Specific to polycrystalline samples`, `Optimally doped region only`, `Valid for x=0.4-0.6`, `Observed in HP-annealed samples`

#### **{CONDITIONS}** [When specific experimental conditions matter]
Measurement or synthesis conditions under which the claim holds.
- Examples: `Measured at ambient pressure`, `Under 2 GPa hydrostatic pressure`, `At 470°C annealing temperature`, `Room temperature measurement`, `Low temperature (<2K)`

## CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES

1. **One claim per relationship**: If a sentence describes multiple independent findings, create separate claims
2. **Preserve quantitative information**: Always include numerical values, units, and error bars when present
3. **Link mechanism to structure**: When text connects structural changes (e.g., bond angles, lattice parameters) to property changes (e.g., Tc), ALWAYS extract the {MECHANISM}
4. **Distinguish correlation from causation**: Use precise language—"correlates with" vs. "causes" vs. "leads to"
5. **Capture negative results**: Include claims about what did NOT change or what degraded
6. **Avoid interpretation**: Extract only what the text explicitly states; do not infer unstated mechanisms
7. **Maintain chemical precision**: Preserve exact formulas, subscripts, site labels (Ch1 vs. Ch2), and crystallographic notation

# REPORT

Excellent — this output is **very close**, but it still reveals a few **systematic deviations from Prompt v2.2** that are worth fixing now, because they will otherwise propagate downstream into JSON and graph construction.

I’ll go point by point, grounded strictly in v2.2 rules.

---

## Overall assessment (high-level)

* ✅ Claims are **explicit and text-faithful**
* ✅ Entity cardinality is now **stable**
* ✅ No hallucinated mechanisms
* ❌ **Two recurring violations remain**:

  1. **Forbidden enrichment inside entities**
  2. **Attribute leakage / normalization drift**

These are subtle but important.

---

## Issue 1 — Forbidden entity enrichment (CRITICAL)

### Problem

You are still adding **non-textual descriptive attributes** inside entities, e.g.:

```markdown
Key Attributes: BiS2-based layered superconductor
```

This violates **Section 5: Forbidden Entity Content**:

> Do NOT add inferred properties
> Do NOT add evaluative descriptors

Even though this is *true*, it is **not explicitly asserted** in the sentence-level claim being extracted.

### Why this matters

* It introduces **latent ontology assumptions** into stage 1
* It creates **duplicate semantic encoding** (material family leaks early)
* It makes entity equality ambiguous in the graph (same material, different descriptors)

### Fix (MANDATORY)

For **stage 1**, entities must be **nearly atomic**.

#### Correct version

```markdown
- {ENTITY 1}: LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
  - Type: Material
```

That’s it.

Everything else belongs in:

* stage 2 enrichment
* ontology alignment
* or material normalization

---

## Issue 2 — “Trend” overuse (SUBTLE but important)

### Problem

You are still filling `Trend` with:

* `Induced`
* `Positive Correlation`
* `Negative Correlation`

But **v2.2 allows Trend ONLY if explicitly stated as a trend**.

Let’s check each case.

---

### Claim 1

> “induces uniaxial strain”

Is this a *trend*?

No — it is a **causal action**, already encoded in `Driver → Effect`.

#### ❌ Incorrect

```markdown
Trend: Induced
```

#### ✅ Correct

Omit `Trend` entirely.

---

### Claim 2

> “increases superconducting properties”

This **is acceptable** as a trend, because “increases” is explicit.

However, normalize carefully.

#### ✅ Acceptable

```markdown
Trend: Increases
```

Avoid abstract labels like “Positive Correlation” unless the paper explicitly says “correlated”.

---

### Claim 3

> “degrades superconducting properties”

Again, this is explicit directionality.

#### ✅ Acceptable

```markdown
Trend: Decreases
```

---

## Issue 3 — Driver normalization drift (IMPORTANT)

### Problem

In Claim 3:

```markdown
Driver: Annealing at 700 °C in evacuated quartz tube (reverses strain)
```

The parenthetical **“(reverses strain)”** is an **interpretive gloss**, not raw text.

This violates:

> Do NOT add causal language not present in the text.

Even if the paper implies this, stage 1 must not encode it.

### Fix

Split **process description** from **interpretation**.

#### ✅ Correct

```markdown
Driver: Annealing at 700 °C in evacuated quartz tube
```

The effect already captures degradation — no need to explain why.

---

## Issue 4 — Entity completeness in Claim 2 (OPTIONAL improvement)

Claim 2 discusses:

> “superconducting properties (Tc and shielding fraction)”

But neither appears as an entity.

This is **not strictly wrong** under v2.2, because:

* At least one entity is present
* The claim is graph-representable

However, for **graph usefulness**, you may want to extract:

```markdown
- {ENTITY 3}: Superconducting properties
  - Type: Physical Property
```

⚠️ Do **not** split into Tc + shielding fraction unless values or measurements are explicitly given.

This is optional, not required.

---

## What the *corrected* v2.2 output would look like (one example)

### Claim 1 — corrected

```markdown
- {CLAIM}: Annealing LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressure induces uniaxial strain along the c-axis.
  - {CLAIM ATTRIBUTES}:
    - Subject: LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
    - Driver: High-pressure annealing
    - Effect: Uniaxial strain along the c-axis
  - {ENTITIES}:
    - {ENTITY 1}: LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
