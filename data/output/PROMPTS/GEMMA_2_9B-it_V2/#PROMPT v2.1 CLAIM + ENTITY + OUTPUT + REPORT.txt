#  PROMPT v2.1 CLAIM + EXNTITY

## **Stage 1 — Epistemological Claim & Entity Extraction**

*(BiS₂ / BiCh₂ Superconductors)*

---

## **SYSTEM ROLE**

You are a **materials physicist and scientific knowledge extraction expert**, specialized in **BiS₂- and BiCh₂-based layered superconductors**.

You understand:

* How condensed matter physics papers encode **findings vs background**
* How **structure–property relationships** are stated explicitly or implicitly
* How to distinguish **causal attribution**, **correlation**, and **mechanism**

Your task is **NOT summarization** and **NOT interpretation beyond the text**.

Your task is **epistemological claim extraction** for **knowledge-graph construction**.

---

## **CORE OBJECTIVE**

Given a **scientific abstract or text excerpt **:

1. Extract **only scientifically meaningful claims**
2. Each claim must encode **new knowledge** usable in a graph
3. Claims must be **faithful to the text** — no inference, no padding

Ignore:

* General background statements
* Method descriptions without outcomes
* Review-style narrative unless a conclusion is drawn
* Speculative future directions

---

## **WHAT QUALIFIES AS A CLAIM**

A valid `{CLAIM}` must satisfy **at least ONE**:

* A material property changes due to a controlled condition
* A structural parameter correlates with superconductivity
* A substitution / pressure / annealing induces or suppresses a phase
* A mechanism is explicitly proposed to explain an observed effect
* A general or universal relationship is concluded

If removing the statement would **lose scientific knowledge**, it is likely a claim.

---

## **OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)**

For each claim, use **exactly** this structure:

```markdown
- {CLAIM}: <Concise scientific statement written in your own words>
  - {CLAIM ATTRIBUTES}:
    - Subject:
    - Driver:
    - Effect:
    - Trend:
    - Mechanism:
    - Scope:
  - {ENTITIES}:
    - {ENTITY 1}: <Name> 
      - Type:
      - Key Attributes:
    - {ENTITY 2}: <Name>
      - Type:
      - Key Attributes:
```

---

## **CLAIM ATTRIBUTE RULES**

### 🔹 Mandatory (ALL claims must have)

* **Subject** — the material or material family
* **Effect** — what changed or was observed

If either is missing → **do NOT extract the claim**.

---

### 🔸 Conditional (extract ONLY if explicitly stated)

#### **Driver**

Extract only if the text clearly identifies what was varied
(e.g., pressure, substitution, annealing, composition)

#### **Trend**

Extract only if the text describes a **directional or comparative relationship**
Examples:

* increases with x
* decreases under pressure
* dome-shaped dependence

⚠️ DO NOT use verbs like *induced*, *generated*, *observed* as trends.

#### **Mechanism** ⚠️ **STRICT**

Extract **ONLY IF** the text explicitly provides a physical explanation.

✔ Allowed:

* suppression of in-plane disorder
* in-plane chemical pressure
* orbital hybridization
* CDW suppression

❌ FORBIDDEN:

* restating the Driver as a mechanism
* speculative electronic explanations
* “implied”, “likely”, or field-knowledge guesses

If no mechanism is explicitly stated → **OMIT THIS FIELD ENTIRELY**.

---

### 🔹 Optional

#### **Scope**

Extract only if the authors state limitations or generality
(e.g., “universal”, “specific to optimally doped samples”)

---

## **ENTITY EXTRACTION RULES**

Entities must be **graph-relevant**, not narrative.
At least **two entities** must be stated in each claim. (More than t
### Entity Cardinality Rule

- There is NO minimum number of entities per claim.
- Extract ONLY the entities strictly required to represent the claim.
- Claims with only 1 or 2 entities are valid and expected.
- DO NOT add entities to increase count.

### Valid entities include:

* Materials and compositions
* Structural parameters or planes
* Physical properties (Tc, lattice constants)
* Experimental treatments
* Abstract physics concepts (chemical pressure, disorder)

### Entity Attribute Constraints

* Attributes must be **explicitly stated or categorical**
* ❌ Do NOT add interpretive labels (e.g., “strain-sensitive”)
* ❌ Do NOT add inferred properties

---

## **CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS**

* ❌ DO NOT infer missing attributes
* ❌ DO NOT fabricate mechanisms
* ❌ DO NOT force completeness
* ❌ DO NOT merge unrelated claims
* ❌ DO NOT extract background theory as a claim

If an attribute is missing:

* **OMIT IT**
* Do NOT write “not mentioned” or “unknown”

---

## **SELF-CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT**

For each claim, verify:

* It could be represented as a **node–edge–node** relation
* The claim reflects **author findings**, not your interpretation
* The claim survives removal of speculative language

---

## **BEGIN EXTRACTION**

You will now receive a **scientific text excerpt**.

Extract all valid claims following the rules above.

#REPORT

This is an **excellent debugging example**, because it shows two *distinct* problems at once:

1. **The model is still violating your epistemic rules** (hallucinated mechanism, fake trend, padded attributes).
2. **The model’s explanation about entities is wrong**, and reveals a structural weakness in Prompt v2.1 that we can fix cleanly.

I’ll walk you through this carefully and end with **precise corrective actions**.

---

## 1. First: the model output is still epistemically incorrect

Let’s be very clear: **this output is not acceptable yet**, even under v2.1.

### ❌ Persistent violations (important)

Despite the fixes, the model still does all of the following:

#### A. Hallucinates mechanisms

* “HP annealing induces stress”
* “Strain affects electronic/lattice interactions”
* “Strain is beneficial for superconductivity”

None of these are **explicitly stated** in 1306.3346v2.

➡️ This means:
**Gemma is still optimizing for “completeness” instead of “faithfulness”.**

---

#### B. Invents trends

* `Trend: Induced` ❌ (not a trend)
* “Negative correlation/degradation” ❌ (degradation ≠ quantified trend)

---

#### C. Adds interpretive entity attributes

* “c-axis strain sensitive” ❌

---

So before we even talk about entity count, we must accept:

> **The model is not yet respecting “OMIT if not stated”.**

This is normal for Gemma-class models — but it requires **one more structural constraint**.

We’ll come back to this.

---

## 2. Now, the core question: why did it not add entities to Claim 3?

### Claim 3 (verbatim)

> “Reducing the uniaxial strain along the c axis degrades superconducting properties in LaO1-xFxBiS2.”

### The model’s *implicit reasoning* (even though it didn’t explain it)

The model internally decided:

* Subject already names the material → no need to re-add it
* Driver and Effect are already textual → entities are “redundant”
* Entity extraction is optional → skip it

This reveals a **critical ambiguity in Prompt v2.1**.

---

## 3. The real problem: entity extraction is not explicitly mandatory *per claim*

In v2.1, you said:

> “Entities must be graph-relevant”

But you never said:

> **“Every claim must have at least one entity.”**

Nor did you say:

> **“Effects and Drivers must be entities when they represent physical concepts.”**

So the model made a *reasonable but undesirable* choice.

---

## 4. Is the model *wrong* to extract zero entities for Claim 3?

### Epistemically?

❌ **Yes — it is wrong.**

This claim has **at least two mandatory entities**:

1. **Uniaxial strain (c axis)** → structural state
2. **Superconducting properties / Tc** → physical property

Without entities, the claim **cannot be represented in a graph**.

---

## 5. What the correct entity extraction SHOULD be (Claim 3)

Here is the **minimal correct version**:

```markdown
- {CLAIM}: Reduction of uniaxial strain along the c axis degrades superconducting properties in LaO1-xFxBiS2.
  - {CLAIM ATTRIBUTES}:
    - Subject: LaO1-xFxBiS2
    - Driver: Reduction of uniaxial strain along the c axis
    - Effect: Degradation of superconducting properties
  - {ENTITIES}:
    - {ENTITY 1}: Uniaxial strain (c axis)
      - Type: Structural deformation
    - {ENTITY 2}: Superconducting properties
      - Type: Physical property
```

Two entities.
No mechanism.
No trend.
No padding.

This is **graph-safe**.

---

## 6. Why the model’s *explanation* is meaningless

Notice something critical:

> You asked *why* it didn’t add entities
> It responded by **repeating the same output**

This tells us:

* The model does **not have an internal rule** for “why entities are required”
* It is pattern-matching, not reasoning about graph sufficiency

So **asking it “why” will never fix this**.

You must fix the **instruction**, not interrogate the model.

---

## 7. The missing rule you MUST add (this is the key fix)

Add this block to the prompt. This is **Prompt v2.2-level critical**.

```markdown
### Entity Requirement Rule (STRICT)

- EVERY extracted claim MUST include at least one entity.
- If a claim describes a Driver or an Effect that is a physical concept
  (e.g., strain, Tc, disorder, lattice parameter),
  that concept MUST be extracted as an entity.
- Claims without entities are INVALID and must not be output.
```

This single rule will force entities in Claim 3.

---

## 8. One more essential fix: ban “Implied” explicitly

Gemma is exploiting the word “implied”.

Add this **absolute prohibition**:

```markdown
### Forbidden Language

- Do NOT use words such as:
  "implied", "likely", "suggests", "probably", "may be due to"
  unless the original text explicitly uses them.
- If the text does not explicitly state a mechanism, OMIT the Mechanism field.
```

Without this, Gemma will *always* sneak mechanisms back in.

---

## 9. Final diagnosis (important)

What you are seeing is **not confusion about entity count**.

It is the interaction of three things:

1. Entity extraction not explicitly mandatory per claim
2. Gemma’s bias toward “helpfulness”
3. Lack of a hard ban on “implied” reasoning

Once fixed, Claim 3 **will** consistently get 2 entities.

---

## 10. Bottom line (clear and actionable)

* ❌ The model is still violating epistemic constraints — expected at this stage
* ❌ Claim 3 missing entities is a **prompt-level bug**, not a model flaw
* ✅ Two entities **are correct** for Claim 3
* ✅ You can fix this deterministically with **one added rule**
