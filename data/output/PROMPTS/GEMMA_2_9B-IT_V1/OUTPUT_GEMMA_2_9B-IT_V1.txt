    "High pressure (HP) resistivity measurement and HP annealing were performed for a BiS2-based superconductor Bi2(O, F)S2, which caused different variation of Tc. In HP resistivity measurement, Tc linearly decreased at the rate of -1.2 K GPa-1. In contrast, by HP annealing at 2 GPa and 470°C, Tc increased in undoped and underdoped samples, and maintained at 5.1 K in optimally-doped sample. In HP resistivity measurement high pressure is applied in-situ at low temperatures, while HP annealing quenches the high pressure and high temperature phase to ambient pressure. Although in both cases hydrostatic high pressure is applied to the sample by a cubic-anvil-type apparatus, the difference between the two methods should be considered carefully. HP annealing technique have been mainly developed on BiS2-based superconductors, but this method can cause unique effects on physical properties of various layered compounds.",
    "The expansion of a-axis may lead to flatter Bi-S plane. In LaOBiS2, F-doping not only increases the carrier concentration but also flattens the buckling of the Bi-S plane and this structural transformation is also related to the appearance of superconductivity. Similar phenomena would happen in the undoped and underdoped Bi2(O, F)S2 by HP annealing, which resulted in the increases of Tcs in these samples."

    "The in-plane chemical pressure effect is not the origin for the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution.",
    "The absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases by Sn substitution for x = 0.1-0.4, which can be corresponding to the slight increase in electron carriers by Sn substitution.",
    "The origin of the hump in the resistivity was proposed as a CDW transition.",
    "The suppression of the CDW ordering is the origin for the increased Tc in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6.",
    "Se substitution reduced the in-plane disorder at the S1 site and induced bulk superconductivity.",
    "The bulk nature of superconductivity was induced by local structural optimization but not due to changes in carrier concentration.",
    "We can expect material development in related fourlayer-type oxychalcogenide superconductors."
