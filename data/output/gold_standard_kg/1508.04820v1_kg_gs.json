    "BiS2 presents a 'hidden' 1D electronic structure.",
    "Sulfur s-orbital undergoes strong hybridization with Bismuth p-orbital.",
    "Including s- and p-orbital pairs and intra/interband scattering yields results consistent with experiments.",
    "Single-gap SC models do not produce acceptable results for this family."
