  "general_conclusions": [
    "Key factors to induce superconductivity in Fe chalcogenides are suppression of antiferromagnetism and reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe.",
    "Reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe can be achieved by oxygen intercalation or acid annealing.",
    "Red wine is noted as more effective for annealing than other solutions.",
    "BiS2 layer plays a role similar to CuO2 planes in cuprates."
