a new member of BiS2-based superconductor, Bi2(O, F)S2 with Tc = 5.1 K was discovered. Topotactic reductive fluorination using XeF2 in the temperature range of 200 ~ 400°C was found to be useful for obtaining Bi2(O, F)S2 as the main phase and the reaction at 400°C is suitable for successful control of fluorine content resulting in high quality superconductors with sharp transitions and large superconducting volume fractions. Our synthesis of Bi2(O, F)S2 using XeF2 is the first topotactic reductive fluorination to obtain an electron-doped superconductor. Topotactic fluorination could be widely used for the control of physical properties in various compounds, including layered compounds with complex stacking structure, and this would be helpful for further exploration of novel superconductors.
