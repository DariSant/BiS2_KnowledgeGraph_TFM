In conclusion, we reported the impact of hydrostatic pressure on the superconductivity of BiS2 based new superconductors LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. Superconductivity is enhanced dramatically with improved normal state conduction for all the studied systems. These results call for unusual superconductivity in these systems along with strong electron correlations. The upper critical field is estimated from electrical resistivity under magnetic field and applied pressure data and found to be 15.9Tesla, 8.8 Tesla and 8.2Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. It seems the BiS2 based superconductors are quite robust against magnetic field. Our results are in confirmation with the very recent report by Wolowiec et al.[23,24], with an added feature on upper critical field of the under pressure samples. These results on new BiS2 based superconductors are thought provoking and do call for the attention of condensed matter physics community.
