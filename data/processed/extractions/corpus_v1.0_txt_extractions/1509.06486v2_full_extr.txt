We achieved the increase of Tc by the Pb substitution of Bi in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The enhancement of Tc is attributed the change in the lattice contraction along the c axis. The Tc zero increases with decreasing c axis, and becomes the maximum value around 5.6 K at the Pb concentration of 6 %, which is the highest value among BiS2 based superconductors synthesized under the ambient pressure. These results indicate that superconductivity in this material is strongly associated with the lattice strain.
