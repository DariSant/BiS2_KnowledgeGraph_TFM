The superconductivity of CeOBiS2 without fluorine doping was examined down to 0.13 K. Poly-crystalline CeOBiS2 showed zero resistivity below 1.3 K while LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2 poly-crystalline samples did not show superconductivity down to 0.13 K. The superconductivity of the CeOBiS2 single crystal was also observed at around 1.2 K, and it was similar to that found in the poly-crystalline sample. Therefore, the valence fluctuations between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states can induce superconducting transition without chemical doping, showing the potential of such valence fluctuations for exploring new
