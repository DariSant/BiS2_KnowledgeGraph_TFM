We have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system, Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. Polycrystalline samples for x = 01 were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Both lattice constants, a and c, monotonically increases with increasing x. This linear relationship between lattice constants and Se content is different from that of related compounds, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. Crystal structure analysis by the Rietveld refinement showed that this is due to the indistinct site selectivity of Se substitution; namely, Se occupied both of in-plane Ch1 and out-of-plane Ch2 sites. The sample with x = 0 exhibited the semiconducting-like T and weak superconducting signals. Metallic-like conductivity and bulk superconductivity were induced by Se substitution. Such characteristics were qualitatively described in terms of increased in-plane CP, as in the case of related compounds. The highest Tc was 3.5 K for x = 0.6, and superconductivity phase diagram was established. Magnetic transition, probably due to ferromagnetic order of magnetic moment of Ce3+, coexists with bulk superconductivity in BiCh2 layer. The coupling between superconductivity and magnetic order is ignorable in Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex.
