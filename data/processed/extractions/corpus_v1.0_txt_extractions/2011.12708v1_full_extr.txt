We have synthesized CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystals using a flux method. The single crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that the crystal has a tetragonal structure with the space group of P4/nmm. BVS calculations showed that the valence of Ce ions is 3.25, indicating the mixed-valence state of Ce. Bulk superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.3 K was confirmed through the electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements. The estimation of anisotropy parameter γ of Bc2 revealed that the γ for CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 is lower than that observed for RE(O, F)BiS2 crystals. In the in-plane anisotropy measurements, two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states was observed. These results suggest that CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 is a new nematic superconductor.
