We have investigated the in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis MR in both superconducting and normal states of single crystals of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 under in-plane magnetic fields. In the superconducting states, four-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of MR was observed below the Tc. Since the crystal structure of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is tetragonal, the results suggest no symmetry breaking in the in-plane anisotropy of MR in the superconducting states. This is clearly different from those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals, in which two-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR was observed in its superconducting states. We consider that the switching between twofold-symmetric and four-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR in the superconducting properties of those systems is related to the constituent elements at the superconducting planes, which is expected to modify the spin-orbit interactions. In the normal states of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, two-fold symmetric MR with a small amplitude was observed, while four-fold-symmetric anisotropy was observed in the normal states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. We consider that the normal-state in-plane anisotropy of MR in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is caused by local structural instability that is commonly observed in BiCh2-based compounds and tunable by chemical pressures.
