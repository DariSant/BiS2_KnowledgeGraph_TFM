resistivity and µSR measurements have been performed on superconducting Bi4O4S3. Temperature dependence of the upper critical fields and also the absolute value, Hc2(0) = 15.3(4) kOe were determined from the resistivity measurements. The Hc2(T ) data shows a positive curvature close to Tc, which is a sign of multi-gap superconductivity in Bi4O4S3. ZFµSR data show no sign of magnetic anomaly in the superconducting ground state of Bi4O4S3. The temperature dependence of λ-2 is compatible with a twogap s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values, ∆1(0) = 0.93(3), ∆2(0) = 0.09(4) meV and penetration depth, λ(0) = 861(17) nm. The presence of two superconducting gaps in Bi4O4S3 is predicted by theoretical works such as first principles band structure calculations suggesting two band crossing the Fermi surface and the RPA analysis of a two-orbital model for the BiS2based superconductors [10, 11]. Hall, Seebeck coefficients and magnetoresistance measurements also further support our experimental finding [13, 15]. It is worth mentioning that even though our data are more compatible with a two-gap model, a single-gap model can not be ruled out completely. Our results show that Bi4O4S3 is a bulk superconductor with a fully developed node-less superconducting energy gap and extremely low superfluid density compared to other layered superconductors. The µSR experiments were performed at the Swiss Muon Source (SµS), Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland)
