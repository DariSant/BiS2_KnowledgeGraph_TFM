We have successfully grown Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals with the nominal compositions of SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.3-0.8) using KI-KCl flux. The solid solution limit of F at the O site is approximately less than 20 at%. The difference of c-axis lattice constants could not be observed in the all samples. But analytical F contents were similar value which was approximately 20 at% F substitution in O-site. Therefore, Sm(O, F)BiS2 with approximately 20 at% F substitution has possibility to be of intrinsic stable phase. In consequence, F concentrations and c-axis lattice constants are hardly controlled by nominal F contents. On the other hand, the peak shape of associated absorption-edge spectra for Sm was almost the same between x = 0.3 and 0.5, which was mainly trivalent electronic configuration (Sm3+). Superconducting transition temperature were increased with increasing nominal F contents within less than x = 0.7 despite similar chemical properties. The upper critical fields and superconducting anisotropies showed no remarkable tendencies regardless of the various nominal F contents within x = 0.3-0.8 range. However, values of those superconducting parameters exhibited some differences. Those observations may be originated from other chemical parameters such as a-axis lattice constants, elemental deficiency and so on.
