we have established a superconductivity phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiSSe with information about the crystal structure and the normal-state transport characteristics. In an ideal BiCh2-based compound with less in-plane disorder, metallic transport and superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small amount of electron doping. For LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram. The intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based compounds should be useful for understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the system. In conclusion, we have investigated the crystal structure and the physical properties of LaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based compounds. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters for LaO1-xFxBiSSe and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, we revealed that the essence of in-plane chemical pressure effect was the suppression of the local in-plane disorder in the BiCh2 layers. The in-plane disorder causes the absence of metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity in typical REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Since the in-plane disorder was fully suppressed for all x in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, this system is one of the most ideal system to discuss the intrinsic nature of the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds. In LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small amount of electron doping. For LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram.
