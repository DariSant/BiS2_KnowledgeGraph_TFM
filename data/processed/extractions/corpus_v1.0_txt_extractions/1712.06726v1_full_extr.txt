We have reported the synthesis of a new layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6. On the basis of the material design concept revealed in LaOBiPbS3, rock-salt-type (Ag0.66Bi0.34)S layers are inserted into the BiS2-based LaO(Bi0.9Ag0.1)S2. From synchrotron XRD, Rietveld refinement, and TEM, the crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 was revealed, as shown in Fig. 1(c), which is similar to that of LaOBiPbS3 with the P4/nmm space group, and the lattice constant estimated from the Rietveld refinement and TEM had similar values (c ~ 20 Å). The temperature dependences of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient suggested that the electronic states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than those of LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3, which may be due to the formation of short M2-S1 bonds along the c-axis. The insertion of a rock-salt-type chalcogenide into the van der Waals gap of BiS2-based layered compounds, such as LaOBiS2, will be a useful strategy for designing new layered functional materials in the layered chalcogenide
