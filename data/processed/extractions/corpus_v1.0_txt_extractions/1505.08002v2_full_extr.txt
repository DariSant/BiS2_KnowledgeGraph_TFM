the superconducting transition in EuFBiS2 was induced by only applying pressure. The electrical resistivity at ambient pressure showed semiconducting behavior with a broad hump at around 230 K. EuFBiS2 showed insulator-metal transition and the superconductivity was observed at a pressure of 0.7 GPa. Tc increased gradually with increasing pressure and showed a maximum of 8.6 K at a pressure of 1.8 GPa.
