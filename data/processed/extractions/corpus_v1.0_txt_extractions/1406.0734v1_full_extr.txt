Single crystals of La(O, F)BiSe2 were successfully grown by the CsCl flux method. The X-ray structural analysis revealed La(O, F)BiSe2 crystalized with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1408(2) Å, c = 14.1096(6) Å). The magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurement clearly showed the superconducting transition at 3.6 K. The structural analysis suggested a possibility of raising up the Tc if the corrugated Bi-Se layer could be flatten by applying chemical or physical pressure as well as BiS2-based superconductors.
