In conclusion, a study of temperature dependent magnetic penetration depth and super fluid density in the newly discovered layered sulphide Bi4O4S3 superconductor confirms a fully gapped s-wave pairing in the strong coupling limit. The low temperature  T  values show exponential temperature dependence.   tends to be rather fIat below 0.5Tc and marks the signature of fully developed superconducting gap. Superfluid density is very best fitted with single gap s-wave equation with gap ratio 2Δ0=7.2kBTc that indicates the existence of strong electron phonon coupling in this primary BiS2 based layered superconductor.
