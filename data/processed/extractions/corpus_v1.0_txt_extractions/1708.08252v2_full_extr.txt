we have investigated the isotope effect on Tc of BiCh2-based layered superconductor LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 using 76Se and 80Se isotopes. Comparing the transition temperatures investigated from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements, we have revealed that the exponent Se is close to zero. Our results suggest that the pairing in the LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 superconductor is not mediated by phonons, and unconventional superconductivity may emerge in the BiCh2 layer. To completely exclude the phonon-mediated mechanisms, we have to examine the S isotope effect for the same composition (LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2) and for a system with a pure BiS2 layer, such as Nd(O, F)BiS2 with a higher Tc of 5 K.
