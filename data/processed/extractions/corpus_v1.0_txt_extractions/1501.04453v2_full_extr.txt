In summary, we have measured polarized Raman scattering spectra of BiS-based SC single crystal NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc = 4.5K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (Tc = 4.8K) from 10K to 300K. The observed Raman modes are assigned with the aid of first-principles calculations. And an investigation on the Fano-type A1g mode gives an electron-phonon coupling constant  ~ 0.16, which is not strong enough to produce superconductivity at ~4.5 K. We further observe a low-energy electronic hump. It can be quantitatively explained by the vertical transitions around Fermi surface between the two bands split by spin-orbit coupling. The transitions are dramatically enhanced due to the particular rectangular-like Fermi surface, and hence provides a unique window to quantitatively probe the band splitting.
