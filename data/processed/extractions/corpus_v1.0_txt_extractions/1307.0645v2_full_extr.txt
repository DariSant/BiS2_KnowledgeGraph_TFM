we have carried out the temperature dependence high pressure electrical resistivity measurements up to ~1.8 GPa for BiS2 based Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 novel layered superconductors. Also, we have investigated the variation of Tc at different applied pressures using four probe techniques. The Tc onset decreases gradually from 4.8 K to 4.3 K in Bi4O4S3 for all the applied pressures (0 to 1.4 GPa) and therefore it holds a negative pressure coefficient of -0.287 K/GPa. Contrarily, the pressure effect on Tc of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 has positive pressure coefficient where the Tc onset increases up to 1.31 GPa at a rate of 0.435 K/GPa and thereafter it reduces for further enhancement of pressure becomes negative coefficient (dTc onset/dP= -0.1714 K/GPa K/GPa) on Tc at high pressure of 1.75 GPa. The present results of hydrostatic pressure studies on electrical resistivity of these two BiS2 based superconductors from  vs T studies suggest that the change of Tc and superconducting state under pressure obtained for both compounds are to quite different from each other. Further theoretical and other experimental studies are required to understand the BiS2 based series of superconducting materials.
