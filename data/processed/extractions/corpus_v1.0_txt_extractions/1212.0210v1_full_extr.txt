Summarizing, a weak-coupling RPA analysis of a minimal 2-orbital model was used to investigate the pairing properties of the BiS2-based superconductors. Fillings between 0.46 and 1.0 were analyzed. The Hund's coupling was varied in the range 0.1 ≤J/U ≤0.4. Qualitatively, the results are similar for all values of J/U and different fillings. In the RPA results described here, a clear relationship is found between quasi FS nesting, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity: the topology of the two hole-pockets is such that they present almost parallel segments close to the (π/2, π/2) wavevector in the BZ. It is found that the horizontal distance (kn, 0) between the tangents to these segments at the points where they cross the Σ line is also where the noninteracting susceptibility χ0 has a pronounced peak at (kn, 0), for 0.46 ≤n ≤1.0. Once interactions are introduced, this peak will diverge at a certain critical coupling U for each filling, and all the values of J/U studied (with exception of one: n = 0.5, J/U = 0.1). In addition, a line of local maxima, connecting the BZ points (kn, 0) and (0, kn), is clearly observed in a 2-d plot of χ0. As expected, this line can also be associated to FS nesting. This nesting structure gives origin to pairing functions with similar eigenvalues, i. e., similar pairing strengths, and symmetries B2g and A1g. This close competition originates in the FS quasi nesting properties, which determine the spin-fluctuation-mediated inter-pocket pair scattering. This pair scattering is overwhelmingly between two adjacent FS segments, therefore the properties of the pairing functions, including the pairing strength, are quite "local", having almost no dependence on their global symmetry. One can then predict that pairing symmetry measurements may contain a mixture of both symmetries if the pairing mechanism is driven by spin fluctuations.
