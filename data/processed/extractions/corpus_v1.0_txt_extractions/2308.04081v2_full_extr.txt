we have studied the crystal structure evolution of HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressures and confirmed that the HEA-type sample also exhibits a tetragonalmonoclinic transition at a pressure range similar to that for zero-entropy LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Therefore, the increase in RE-site ΔSmix does not affect pressure-structure phase diagram in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. To investigate whether Tc-pinning phenomena occur in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressures, we measured P dependence of Tc by collecting R-T data for RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2. All samples exhibited clear decreases in Tc with increasing pressure in the monoclinic phase, which indicates the absence of Tc-pinning phenomena in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The obtained results are consistent with the scenario that Tc-pinning phenomena occur when glassy atomic vibrations are induced by introduction of HEAtype sites in HEA-type superconductors.
