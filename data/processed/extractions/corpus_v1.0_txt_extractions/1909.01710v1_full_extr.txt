we succeeded in growing a single crystal of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). Platelike single crystals with dimensions of 0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3 were obtained. We discovered bulk superconductivity at Tc = 4.7 K in a compound with x = 0.2. The lattice constant of the c-axis decreased with an increase in Ce content x. The shrinking of the c-axis indicated the mixed valency of Ce3+/Ce4+. It is likely that the superconductivity of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was induced by the electron doping of the mixed valence of Ce3+/Ce4+. The superconducting transition temperature of Ce-substituted Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was slightly lower than that of F-substituted NdO1-xFxBiS2. This tendency is also observed in Ce-substituted La1-xCexOBiSSe and Ce1-xPrxOBiS2. ρ(T) of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 showed a metallic behavior. In a compound with x = 0.5, a broad hump was observed in ρ(T) at approximately 80 K, similar to that found in CeOBiS2. The electrical resistivity of ρ(6 K) and ρ(280 K) increased with increasing x. The tendency of S can be understood by the increase of the Ce4+ ratio with decreasing Ce content below x = 0.5. The upper critical field µ0Hc2(T) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 was determined to be ∼12 T for H || ab and ∼0.34 T for H || c-axis. The anisotropic parameter Γ was estimated to be ∼35, which was comparable to that of F-doped NdOBiS2. The µ0Hc2(0) of the Ce-doped NdOBiS2 was approximately two times smaller than that of the F-doped one, although the difference of Γ was approximately 10. The results imply that the µ0Hc2(0) for both directions reduces in superconductivity induced by Ce-doping. Our results for Cedoped NdOBiS2 make it possible to help understand superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors.
