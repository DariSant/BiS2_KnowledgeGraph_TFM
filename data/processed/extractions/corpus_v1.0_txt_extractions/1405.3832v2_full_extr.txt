We study normal state electrical, thermoelectrical and thermal transport in polycrystalline undoped LaOBiS2 and doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either by conventional solid-state reaction at ambient pressure or by additional high pressure annealing. All our samples present common behaviors such as semiconducting resisitivity, diffusive and negative Seebeck effect and thermal transport dominated by phonon contribution. However, the major difference between doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either by conventional solid-state reaction at ambient pressure or by high pressure annealing, lies in the sign and magnitude of the Hall resistance, which is positive in sign and larger in magnitude in the former sample and negative in sign and smaller in magnitude in the latter sample. This finding indicates the role played by the multiband character of these compounds. The higher electron concentration of samples prepared by high pressure annealing may be closely related to the enhanced superconducting Tc11 K and to the change of structural parameters. Our results indicate that not only charge carrier densities, but also band and electronic parameters are affected by preparation conditions. This work should trigger ab initio calculations which could provide a theoretical framework for our experimental outcomes.
