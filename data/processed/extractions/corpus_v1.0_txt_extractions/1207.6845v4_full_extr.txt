In conclusion, the newly discovered LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor is synthesized in single phase and its bulk superconductivity is established below 2.7K from both magnetization and magneto-transport measurements. The normal state resistivity is semiconducting, implying a possibility for further increase in Tc with optimized doping and chemical pressure. The H-T phase diagram shows linear variation of upper-critical field as a function of temperature near Tc and Hc2(0) is estimated to be ~ 19 kOe. The present communication is not only the timely reproduction of the ref.1 results but the sample quality is slightly improved in terms of phase purity.
