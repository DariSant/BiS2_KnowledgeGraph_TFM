In conclusion we report on a synthesis, crystal structure and SC properties of a new Se-containing layered superconductor: LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, obtained by replacement of sulphur for selenium in recently reported BiS2 - type superconductors. By this substitution the volume of the crystal unit cell increases and the c-parameter expands from 13.3157 Å to 14.01567Å. The new superconductor exhibits bulk superconductivity with Tc = 2.6K. DC magnetization measurements revealed a superconducting shielding fraction of approximately 80 %, which is at least twice higher in comparison to that found in corresponding sulphide LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Moreover, bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5 BiSe2 was confirmed by µSR experiments. No superconducting transition was observed in analogous phases: LaO0.5F0.5SbS2 with antimony substituted for bismuth and LaO0.5F0.5BiTe2 with tellurium for Se.
