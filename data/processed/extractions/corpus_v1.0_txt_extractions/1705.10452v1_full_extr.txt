Cd-doped La(O, F)BiS2 single crystals were grown by using CsCl/KCl flux method with ~1-2 mm square size in a well-developed ab-plane. The X-ray single crystal structural refinement and EPMA compositional analysis were well revealed the Cd doping to the single crystals. The solubility limit of Cd to Bi-site in La(O, F)BiS2 single crystals was found to be around 12 at%. The temperature of zero resistivity of the obtained single crystals was gradually suppressed with Cd-doping. The superconducting transition temperature with zero resistivity of La(O0.54F0.46)(Bi0.92Cd0.08)S2 was 2.3 K, and the superconducting anisotropy was 36. The suppression mechanism of Tc unlike Pb-doped BiS2-based compounds should be investigated in the future, by using the other method, such as scanning tunneling spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy and so on.
