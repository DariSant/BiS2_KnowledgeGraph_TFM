the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 has been examined using neutron powder diffraction and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The structural refinements revealed that two metal sites, M1 and M2 sites, were differently surrounded by sulfur atoms. Furthermore, we found site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. The structural characteristics around the M1 and the M2 site are close to the Bi site of LaOBiS2 and the M2 site are close to the Pb site of rock-salt-type PbS, respectively. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as alternate stacks of the Pb-rich PbS-type layers and the Bi-rich LaOBiS2-type layers. From band calculations for an ideal (LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer are hybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which results in the electronic characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2. Thus, stacking the rock-salt type sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2based layered structure can largely modify the electronic structure and should be a new strategy of band engineering for designing new BiS2-based layered superconductors, thermoelectric materials, or novel functional materials.
