we have investigated the interaction between the HE states of the REO blocking layer, the local structure of the electrically conducting BiS2 layer and the superconducting properties of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The samples with lattice parameters close to PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 (or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) and largely different mixing entropy (Smix) for the RE site were synthesized by changing the number of RE elements contained in the REO blocking layer. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements, the crystal structure parameters, including anisotropic displacement parameters, were investigated. The increase in Smix does not largely affect the bond lengths and the bond angle of the BiS2 conducting layer but clearly suppresses the in-plane disorder at the in-plane S1 site [U11 (S1)], which is the parameter essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. As expected, bulk nature of superconductivity, shielding volume fraction in the superconducting states, is enhanced by the increase in Smix. The present results clearly show that the increase in mixing entropy at the blocking layer can positively affect the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the conducting layer while these layers can be regarded as spatially-separated. The evidence of the interaction between the HE states of the blocking layer, the local structure conducting layer, and the physical properties of the material should be a novel strategy useful to design new layered materials and to enhance the functionality using the concept of high entropy alloy.
