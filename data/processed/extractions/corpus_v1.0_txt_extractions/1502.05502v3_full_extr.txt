In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized the polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound in single phase with superconductivity (Tc) at above 2.8K in both magnetic and electrical resistivity measurements. The estimated Hc2(0) value of the compound is above 20kOe. The Tc of the compound first decreases with applied pressure till around 1.68GPa and for higher pressures a high Tc phase emerges with possible onset Tc of above 5K for 2.5GPa. The impact of hydrostatic pressure on the presently studied LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 is much different than the widely studied LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. Structural details under pressure for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 are
