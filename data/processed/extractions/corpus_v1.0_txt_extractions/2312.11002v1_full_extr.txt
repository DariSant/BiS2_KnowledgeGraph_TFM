CeO(Bi, Sb)S2 single crystals with a size of 0.2-1.0 mm and approximately 150 µm thickness were successfully grown using CsCl/KCl flux. The Sb substitution strongly suppressed the superconductivity in CeOBiS2, and Sb concentration between superconductivity and non-superconductivity was estimated to be approximately 4 at% in the Bi-site. A drastic change in the c-axis lattice parameters was observed around this Sb concentration. On the other hand, no relationship between Ce4+ ion concentrations and superconductivity for CeO(Bi, Sb)S2 superconductors was found.
