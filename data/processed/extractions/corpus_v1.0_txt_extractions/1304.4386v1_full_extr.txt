In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a series of BiS2 layer based Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x superconductors with varying SO4 concentration. The optimally doped superconducting sample Bi4O4S3 has transition temperature 5.3 K which is the highest Tc reported for this compound. The crystal structure establishes the increase in the c-axis for superconducting sample to that of the parent Bi6O8S5 that relates to the bending of Bi2-S2-Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer. The upper critical field was estimated ~2.75T for ρonset and zero temperature coherence length ξGL(0) ~ 110 Å for Hc2(ρonset). The pinning potential U0 scales as B-0.3 for B < 0.1T. Hall measurements confirm dominance of electronic conduction and in conjuction with thermoelectric power data, the Sommerfeld's constant is estimated to be ~ 1.113 mJ/K2 mol. The energy gap calculated through rf susceptibility establishes this system to be strongly coupled superconductor and the data fits well for an isotropic S wave gap.
