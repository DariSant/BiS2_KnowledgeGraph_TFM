In summary, we have synthesized and confirmed the bulk superconductivity by both resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements in the new BiS2-layer-based superconductor Bi3O2S3.. Hall results suggest that electronic charge carriers are dominant in normal state with the unusual low concentration of only 1.5 x 1019 cm-3, indicating the sample has particularly strong electron-phonon interaction, as also confirmed by DOS calculations. The thermopower data shows strong evidence of semi-metallicity for this new Bi-S-O system, and the band overlap is most likely in the range of 27 - 41
