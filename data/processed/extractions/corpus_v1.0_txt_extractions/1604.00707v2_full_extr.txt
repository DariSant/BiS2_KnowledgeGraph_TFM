We examined the crystal structure of a new thermoelectric material family, LaOBiS2-xSex, using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Upon substitution, Se selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Although the Se substitution induces buckling of the Bi-Ch1 plane, its intensification results in the enhancement of the metallic conductivity and thermoelectric power factor. We explained that the enhancement of the power factor was attained owing to the increased in-plane chemical pressure. To investigate the origin of the low thermal conductivity of LaOBiSSe, we analysed the high-temperature crystal structure and atomic displacement parameters. LaOBiSSe exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion. Below 473 K, only the a-axis expands, while both a-axis and c-axis expand above 473 K. We revealed anomalously large atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for the Bi and Ch atoms in the Bi-Ch1 plane. The temperature dependences of Uiso suggest that the temperature evolutions of the atomic vibrations of the Bi-Ch1 plane in the BiCh2 layers are anomalous and similar to that of the rattling atoms in a cage structure. The anisotropic analysis of the atomic displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites suggests that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic displacement along the c-axis direction, which should presumably be the origin of the low thermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. In addition, we assume that the large Bi and Ch1 vibrations are related to the in-plane rattling, which is a new strategy for designing low- thermoelectric materials, as observed in Cu atoms of tetrahedrite compounds.
