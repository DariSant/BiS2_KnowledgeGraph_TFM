the BiS2-based superconductor NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.1 - 0.7) has been successfully synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. Chemical pressure promotes the F substitution, which originated from the exchange of La by Nd. As a result, NdO1-xFxBiS2 with bulk superconductivity can be obtained under ambient pressure. These results demonstrate that the BiS2 layer is the common superconducting layer. Thus, if we synthesize materials with the stacking structure consisting of the BiS2 layer and other blocking layers, new superconductors with the BiS2-layer would be discovered.
