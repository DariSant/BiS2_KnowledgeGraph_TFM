our specific heat experiments on a polycrystalline sample of the BiS2-based superconductor Bi4O4S3 demonstrate that the superconductivity of it is bulk in nature. The Tc is estimated by the specific heat measurements to be Tc = 4.4 K, consistent with that of the resistivity and dc susceptibility. In order to further discuss the superconductivity mechanism of Bi4O4S3, lower temperature specific heat experiments below 2 K is essential.
