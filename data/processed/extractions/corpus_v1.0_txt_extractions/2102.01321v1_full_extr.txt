In this chapter, we reviewed the works on HEA superconductors and HEA-type superconducting compounds, which have been developed applying the HEA concept in simple alloys to more complicated compounds. By introducing a HEA-type site (or alloying multi sites) in a compound, a high mixing entropy can be achieved. HEA-type compounds would have a high mixing entropy at the alloyed site and a highly (randomly) disordered bonding states. For a three-dimensional system, such as NaCl-type chalcogenides, introduction of the HEA-type M site in MCh resulted in suppression of Tc, but, at the same time, slight enhancements of Hc2 and Jc were observed. For tetragonal (CuAl2-type) TrZr2, the introduction of the HEA-type site does not suppress Tc. Furthermore, for layered systems, such as REBa2Cu3O7-d cuprates and BiS2-based RE0.5F0.5BiS2, high-entropy alloying rather improves their superconducting properties. Through investigations of the HEA effects to superconducting and structural properties for HEA-type compounds with different structural types, we conclude that the HEA effects are highly depending on the structural dimensionality. Hence, to effectively use the HEA effect to improve superconducting properties of compounds, target structure should be lower-symmetric, a layered structure or a one-dimensional structure. To obtain further knowledge about the presence/absence of local phase separations, pinning characteristics, and the HEA effect to superconducting pairing states, further investigations on HEA-type superconducting compounds using various probes are required.
