We have systematically investigated the crystal structure, magnetic susceptibility, and electrical resistivity of polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. With increasing Se concentration, the lattice constants a-axis and c-axis systematically increased. With expanding lattice volume by Se substitution, bulk superconductivity was induced for x ≥ 0.3, and the highest Tc of 3.8 K was observed for x = 0.5. One of the notable facts is that the metallic conductivity was observed for x ≥ 0.3 in the resistivity measurement, whereas bad-metal-like (semiconducting-like) behavior was observed for x ≤ 0.2. The induction of bulk superconductivity by the partial substitution of S by Se in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor should be positively linked to the enhancement of metallic conductivity.
