We grew PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals with well-developed ab-planes 1-3 mm in size using CsCl/KCl flux. Increasing the F concentrations of the starting materials enhanced the substitution of F in the grown crystals. The superconducting Tc and γs values of PrO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.05-0.28) single crystals were estimated to be 2.4-4.6 K and 20-58, respectively. The normal-state anisotropies (γn) of Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 (x = 0.3, y = 0.18) single crystals at 5 and 250 K were found to be 39.3 and 21.1, respectively. The s-shaped Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single-crystal junctions under a magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane exhibited a lock-in state at 2.0 K.
