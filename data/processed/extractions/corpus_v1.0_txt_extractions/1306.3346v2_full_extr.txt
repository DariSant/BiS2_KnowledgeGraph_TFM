The correlation between crystal structure and superconducting properties of the BiS2-based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has been investigated. We have synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples with various annealing conditions up to 3 steps. The HP annealing generates uniaxial strain along the c axis. The generated strain is returned to the initial state of the As-grown sample by annealing the sample in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 ºC. The highest superconducting properties, Tc and shielding fraction, are observed in the HP sample, and the superconducting properties is degraded by reducing the uniaxial strain. On the basis of those results, we conclude that the enhancement of the superconducting properties in LaO1-xFxBiS2 by applying post-annealing under high pressure is caused by the generation of the uniaxial strain along the c axis.
