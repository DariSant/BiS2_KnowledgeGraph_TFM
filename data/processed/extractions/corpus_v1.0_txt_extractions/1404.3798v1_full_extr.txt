We have studied magnetic and transport properties of the high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 poly crystalline sample under high magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of upper critical field shows anomalous behavior with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We found that the anisotropy of upper critical field of the polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be estimated by analyzing the characteristic temperatures in the d/dT-T curve. It was found that there were three kinds of upper critical field in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field 0HC2 min is regarded as the 0Hc2 when the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the c axis of the grain. The 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid are regarded as the 0Hc2 where the superconducting states are suppressed for the grains with an orientation of H // ab. The difference between the 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S plane, which is possibly caused by the lattice distortion or strain within the Bi-S plane. Hence, the upper critical fields 0HC2 a-axis and 0HC2 b-axis are different due to the difference of effective mass. The fraction of the grains in superconducting states decreases with increasing magnetic field in the order of 0 T, 0HC2 min, 0HC2 mid and 0HC2 max. Above 0HC2 max, all the grains become non-superconducting. The estimated d0HC2 max/dT, d0HC2 mid/dT and d0HC2 min/dT are -7.05 (T/K), -2.60 (T/K) and -0.95 (T/K), respectively. The anisotropy parameter for upper critical field estimated using d0HC2 max/dT and d0HC2 min/dT is 7.4, which is clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over 30 in the previous report for LaO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals (Tc ~ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and the lower anisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Moreover, the evolution of the in-plane anisotropy within the Bi-S plane may play an important role for the enhancement of Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.
