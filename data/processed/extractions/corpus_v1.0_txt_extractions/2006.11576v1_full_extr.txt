We have investigated the transport properties of a single crystal of BiCh2-based superconductor LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe under high magnetic fields up to 15 T. From the c-axis electrical resistance (measured with a current along the c-axis), the upper critical field was determined. Also, the in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistance was investigated using a 3He probe equipped with a two-axes rotator system to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance. From the in-plane anisotropy measurements, we observed two-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states within the ab plane of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Since the crystal possessed a tetragonal square plane with a tetragonal (four-fold) in-plane symmetry, the appearance of twofold symmetry indicates the rotational symmetry breaking in the superconducting states. The phenomena are very similar to those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe with a higher electron doping concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the carrier doping concentration, which affects the Fermi surface topology, is not an essential parameter for the emergence of the nematicsuperconductivity-like phenomena in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. We hope that the results shown here are useful for further investigation on superconductivity pairing mechanisms of the BiCh2-based compounds and related studies on nematic superconductivity in layered systems.
