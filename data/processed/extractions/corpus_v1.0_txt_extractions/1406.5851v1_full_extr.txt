To summarize, we have grown F-substituted NdOBiS2 superconducting single crystals using KCl/LiCl flux method. The annealed crystals show a typical metallic behavior with a superconducting transition temperature near 4 K. We performed a combined optical spectroscopy and first principle band structural calculation study on Nd(O, F)BiS2 single crystal. The optical measurement reveals a simple metallic behavior with a relatively small plasma frequency of 2.1 eV. Taking the doping level of 7% of itinerant electrons per Bi site as determined by ARPES experiment on the same batch of crystals, the band structure calculations not only well reproduce the spectral weight of the low frequency Drude component but also the energy scales of the interband transitions. Those results indicate essentially the absence of correlation effect in the compound. The study also illustrates that the doping level of superconducting compound is far from the CDW instability suggested in early studies for a doping level of x=0.5.
