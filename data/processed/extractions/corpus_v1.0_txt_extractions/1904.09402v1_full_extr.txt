F-free PrOBiS2 single crystals were successfully grown by a KCl flux. The XAFS spectroscopy analysis showed that the Pr chemical state had a small amount of tetravalent. The electrical resistivity of the PrOBiS2 single crystals exhibited metallic and semiconducting behaviors above and below 50 K, respectively. The resistance with an applied pressure showed semiconducting behavior in the range 2-300 K. No superconductivity in the PrOBiS2 single crystals was observed down to 0.25 K, or under high pressure up to 50 GPa and down to 2 K.
