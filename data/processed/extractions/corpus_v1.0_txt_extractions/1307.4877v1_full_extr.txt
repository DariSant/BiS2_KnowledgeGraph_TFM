In summary, we have investigated the electrical resistivity under external hydrostatic pressures of up to 2.19GPa for BiS2-based polycrystalline PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 layered superconductor. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is monotonically enhanced from 3.7 to 4.7K (2.19GPa). The positive pressure coefficient of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors denotes the possibility of a strong inherent carrier interaction on DOS at N(EF) under pressure. An observed decreasing of electron correlation effect from the values of electron-electron scattering factor (A) and residual resistivity (ρ0) seems noticeable which may occur due to unusual change of hybridization of Pr3+(4f) and Bi3+(6p) on the spacer and conducting layers under external hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore studies are required on both theoretical side and experimental high pressure investigations on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor.
