By using first-principles total energy and stability calculations, we predict that the local Bi-S distortion leads to three polytypes of LaOBiS2-type materials according to the different stacking pattern of BiS2-like layers. The in-plane distortion, mainly induced by the interaction between the intermediate and the side layers and the electron hybridization in the side layer, can lower the total energy comparing with the conventional accepted P4/nmm structure. In LaOBiS2, the energy difference between the polytypes is small, indicating the possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real sample. While we cannot determine if the superposition is dynamic in nature (time-dependent doping, we note that such a superstructure with the combination of T1, T2 and T3 polytypes will effectively lower the symmetry to the P1 space group. Such a superstructure symmetry has been recently suggested by a single-crystal neutron-diffraction experiment of Athauda et al.32 Finally, external pressure and different choices of the intermediate atoms (replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) manifest different ground state polytypes. One can thus tune the distortion and the ground state by both physical and chemical means. Our findings provide a clear picture on the complexity of the crystal structure of LaOBiS2-type materials, which might be relevant to the mechanism of the recently found BiS2-based
