We have investigated Grüneisen parameter (γG) of REO1-xFxBiS2 with different RE ions and carrier concentrations through the measurements of temperature-dependent XRD, sound velocity, and low-temperature specific heat (θD). With increasing in-plane chemical pressure, bulk modulus remarkably increases, and a high γG is observed for RE = Nd. The dependence of γG on in-plane chemical pressure exhibits a good correlation with Tc, and a higher Tc is achieved when γG is large for RE = Nd. In addition, γG shows a slight decrease by a decrease of F concentration (x) in REO1-xFxBiS2. We propose that the anharmonic vibration of Bi along the caxis observed in previous inelastic neutron scattering for thermoelectric LaOBiS2-xSex is present in REO1-xFxBiS2, and the enhancement of the anharmonicity is positively linked to superconducting Tc and pairing mechanisms.
