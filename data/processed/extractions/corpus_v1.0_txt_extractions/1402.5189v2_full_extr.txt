high-quality polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were obtained using high-pressure synthesis technique. The LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample prepared by heating at 700 ºC for 1 h under 2 GPa showed the highest Tc and shielding volume fraction. The estimated transition temperatures were Tconset = 11.1 and Tczero = 8.5 K in the electrical resistivity measurements and Tconset = 11.5 and Tcirr = 9.4 K in the magnetic susceptibility measurements. These values are higher than those of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples obtained from a conventional solid-state reaction. It was found that the high-Tc phase can be stabilized under high pressure and relatively-low heating temperature. XRD experiments indicated that to realize the high-Tc phase in BiS2-based superconductor, the smallest value of the c/a ratio of the lattice constants is essential. Since the superconducting properties of the HP-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample is better than those of the solid-state-reacted samples and the HP-post-annealed samples, detailed investigations of superconducting properties using the HP sample will provide us with important information for elucidating the mechanisms of BiS2-based superconductivity.
