In conclusion, the synthesized BiS2-based superconductor PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1-0.9) is crystallized in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. Reitveld refinement results indicated successful substitution of F at O site. Both electrical resistivity and DC magnetic susceptibility measurements showed bulk superconductivity below 4K. The upper critical field [Hc2(0)] for the optimized PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample is estimated over 4 Tesla from ρ(T, H) measurements. The flux flow activation energy is estimated to be 54.63 meV in 0.05 Tesla field for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. Hall measurement and thermal transport results indicate dominance of electron charge carriers along with strong electron correlation in this compound. Though the Tc of F doped ReOBiS2 is relatively low (2-10K), yet their layered structure, the character ground state, doping pattern, broadening of superconducting transition under magnetic field along with higher S and low κ could put them close to high Tc cuprates and Fe pinctide superconductors.
