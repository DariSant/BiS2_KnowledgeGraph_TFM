In summary, the observed phenomena including suppression and broadening of the superconducting transition, changes of the normal state resistivity with pressure, and the dramatic changes in the normal state electron conduction behavior between 0.42-0.95 GPa strongly suggest a pressure-induced phase transition in the La1-xM xOBiS2 compounds. In contrast to the pressure-induced low-Tc to high Tc phase transitions reported in F-containing BiS2 superconductors, the highpressure phase observed in this work does not favor superconductivity. The results suggest that fluorine plays a critical role for the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc for BiS2-based compounds. For the low-pressure phase, anomalies in the normal state resistivity, which seem to be pressure dependent, were observed in the pressure range from 0.24 to 0.45 GPa. Another unusual phenomenon observed in this study is the tendency toward more semiconducting behavior with increasing pressure in the high-pressure phase. Further studies of these unusual phenomena are expected to enrich our understanding of the physics of solids at high-pressure.
