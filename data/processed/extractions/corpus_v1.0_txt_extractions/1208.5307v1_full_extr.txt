In summary, polycrystalline Bi4-xAgxO4S3 (0≤x≤0.2) samples were prepared, and physical properties investigated. The superconductivity is suppressed by x=0.10, above which the resistivity ρ(T) shows a semiconductor-like temperature dependence, in contrast with a metallic behavior for lower doping levels. The analysis of Seebeck coefficient indicates a multiband behavior and the shift of EF by Ag doping which may explain the suppression of TC. All the results demonstrate that the dopant Ag enters the Bi4AgO4S3 lattice and the superconductivity is rather
