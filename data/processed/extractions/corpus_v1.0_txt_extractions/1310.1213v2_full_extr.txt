We succeeded the growth of F-substituted ROBiS2 (R: La, Ce, Nd) single crystals by using CsCl/KCl flux with different rare earth metals and F substituted contents. The increase of F contents in the starting materials enhanced substituted values of F in the single crystals, but the further increase from 70 % in the starting materials gave the maximum substituted values in the single crystals. These maximum substituted values in the single crystals depended on different rare earth elements. The transport properties of the obtained single crystals were investigated. While their superconducting anisotropies (γs) of the single crystals of RO1-yFyBiS2 (R: La, Nd y = 0.23-0.46) were estimated to be 30-45, that of R = Ce (y = 0.53-0.66) became lower values of 13-21. The F-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals exhibited magnetic order at about 7 K in addition to the superconducting transition at approximately 3 K. Further investigation of obtained single crystals is needed for the origin of these exceptional properties.
