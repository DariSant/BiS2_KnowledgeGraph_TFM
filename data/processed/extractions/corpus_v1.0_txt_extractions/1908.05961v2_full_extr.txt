HP strongly enhances two-dimensionality in LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2. The associated reduction in long-range order along the direction of stacking of Bi(Se/S)2 and LaO/F layers induces formation of stacking faults. The HP SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase better preserves long-range order of the parent SCI phase compared to the S-containing one. This is evident from a more homogeneous structure of diffuse rods for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and, therefore, this system is characterized by weaker interlayer interactions which results in lower SCI-SCII transition pressure. Studied LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2 systems illustrate how structural two-dimensionality is critical for layered superconductors. Targeted enhancement of 2D-structure of layered systems either by external (pressure, temperature) or internal (chemical doping, substitutions) means should be considered as another pathway to further improve their superconducting performance.
