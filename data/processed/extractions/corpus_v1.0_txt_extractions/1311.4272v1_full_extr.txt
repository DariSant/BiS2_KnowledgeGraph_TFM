In this study, we have systematically synthesized the Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples, and investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties. On the basis of systematic investigation on the lattice contraction and the susceptibility, we found that chemical pressure effect induced lattice shrinkage along the a axis. Bulk superconductivity was observed for x ≥ 0.4, and the transition temperature was enhanced with increasing Nd concentration. In this system, the chemical pressure along the a axis upon Nd substitution seemed to be linked with the inducement of bulk superconductivity. However, the chemical pressure effect on Tc in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not completely correspond to the external pressure effect. To clarify the detailed correlation between superconductivity and crystal structure, studies using single crystals are required.
