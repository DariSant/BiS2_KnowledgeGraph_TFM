We successfully grew superconducting Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals using KI-KCl flux. The shape of the obtained Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals was flat, the crystals were approximately 500 μm in size and 10 μm thick, and their ab-plane was well-developed. The composition of the Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals was Sm1.04 ± 0.03O0.83 ± 0.05F0.17 ± 0.05Bi0.97 ± 0.03S2.00, and the lattice constants were a = 3.9672(4) Å and c = 13.417(6) Å. The c-axis lattice constant value was smaller than that of non-superconducting Sm(O, F)BiS2,9 which suggested that the obtained Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals presented high F concentration. Superconducting transition was observed at approximately 4.8 K, which has not reported.9 The γs value of the obtained Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals was evaluated to be 26 using upper critical field values.
