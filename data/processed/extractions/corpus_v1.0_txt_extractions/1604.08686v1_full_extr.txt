In summary, we synthesized the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 polycrystalline sample. The resistivity vanishes below 3.8 K, which together with strong diamagnetic signals in magnetization data, confirming the bulk superconductivity. In contrast to most of the BiS2based compounds where superconductivity is developed from the background of a semiconducting-like normal state, the normal state of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 exhibits a Superconductivity and abnormal pressure effect in Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 superconductor metallic behavior down to Tc. Under magnetic field or pressure, a crossover from metallic to semiconducting behaviors is induced, and the superconductivity is suppressed accordingly. While the Tc decreases with increasing monotonously, the absolute value of the normal state resistivity first decreases and then increases with pressure. All these features are in contrast to the previously known BiS2-based superconductors. While the semiconducting behavior in the normal state of most BiS2 and BiSe2 remains one of the puzzling issue in connection with the unconventional superconductivity, the opposite situation in the present compound, namely, the crossover from the metallic to semiconducting behaviors in the normal in the presence of magnetic field or pressure is rather unusual, pointing to a possible different mechanism of superconductivity in this family of materials. Such feature reminds us of a related single crystal compound Nd(O, F)BiS2[33], where the normal state exhibits the fieldinduced semiconducting behavior above Tc. This feature was attributed to the possible pseudo-gap phase extending to relatively higher temperatures as evidenced by the unusual superconducting fluctuations seen in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiment[33]. We thus expect that the superconducting mechanism of the present system may be also quite unique and deserve further investigations such as by ARPES, NMR or STS experiments in future.
