The phase pure tetragonal CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor with Tc=2.2 K has been synthesized using solid state reaction route and studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on its normal state and superconducting properties. The superconducting transition temperature of the synthesized compound is enhanced fourfold from around 2 K to 8 K at 1.97 GPa. The electrical resistivity data in the entire temperature range has been fitted using activation type equation revealing significant improvement in electrical conduction under pressure. The estimated value of the upper critical field for this compound at 1.97 GPa is above 5 Tesla. The observation of fourfold increase in Tc accompanied with improved normal state conduction under just above 1GPa hydrostatic pressure on CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor calls for the attention of solid state
