the specific heat data show evidence of strong-coupling nature of the observed superconductivity. The polycrystalline samples of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 (x = 0, 0.5) used in this study were synthesized by two-step solid state reaction method. The starting materials, La pieces, SrF2 powder, Bi and S powder are all of high purity (≥99.9%). Firstly, La2S3 was pre-synthesized by reacting stoichiometric S powder and La pieces at 873 K for 10 hours. After that, the as-grown La2S3 and the powder of SrS, SrF2, Bi, and S as starting material were weighted according to their stoichiometric ratio and then fully ground in an agate mortar. The mixture of powder was then pressed into pellets, heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 1073 K for 10 hours and finally furnacecooled to room temperature. The whole process was repeated once again in order to get the pure phase. Crystal structure characterization was performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinements. The electrical resistiv2 ity was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering temperature range from 0.4 to 300 K in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system with a 3He refrigeration insert. Specific heat and Hall effect measurements were also performed in this system. The temperature dependence of d. c. magnetization was measured on a Quantum Design MPMS-5. 20 40 60 F F # # # # # Sr 0.5 La 0.5 FBiS 007 002 204 200 114 104 110 004 Intensity degree SrFBiS 001 # F Sr/La Bi S (a) (b) FIG. 1.

The solid line indicates the unit cell. Figure 1 (a) shows the powder XRD patterns of the Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 (x=0, 0.5) samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed based on a tetragonal cell structure with the P4/nmm space group. Extra minor peaks arising from impurity phase of Bi2S3 can also be seen. The content of impurity phase Bi2S3 estimated by Rietveld fitting is about 15% and 12% for parent compound(x = 0) and x = 0.5 sample, respectively. The lattice parameters of the parent compound SrFBiS2 are extracted to be a = 4.0820˚A and c = 13.8025˚A by Rietveld fitting, in good agreement with the previous report.11 For the La-doped sample, however, the (00l) peaks shift discernibly towards higher 2θ angles, suggesting the smaller c-axis constant. Thus, while the a-axis lattice parameter increases slightly to 4.0822˚A in the La-doped sample, the c-axis decreases significantly to 13.335˚A, implying that the La impurity was indeed doped into the lattice, given that the ionic radius of La ion is known to be smaller than that of Sr. This is quite similar to the case of LaO1-xFxBiS2.4 The resultant crystal structure is therefore schematically shown in the Fig.1(b), which is composed of stacked rock-salt-type BiS2 layer alternating with fluorite-type SrF layer along the c-axis. The zero-field temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ) of these two samples is plotted in Fig. 2(a). For the parent SrFBiS2 compound, the resistivity clearly shows thermally activated behavior with decreasing temperature from 300 K, and no resistivity anomaly can be observed down to 2 K. The thermal activation energy (Ea) obtained by fitting with the thermal activation formula ρ(T ) = ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT ) for the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K is about 38.2 meV, consistent with previous studies.11 However, it is noted that its absolute value is nearly two thirds smaller than the reported value by Lei et al.11 We attribute this to the impurity phase of Bi2S3 with sulfur deficiency12 in our sample which may decrease the absolute value of resistivity. As Sr is partially replaced by La (x = 0.5), the resistivity remains semiconducting-like at high temperatures, with the magnitude of resistivity substantially reduced compared to the undoped sample. Meanwhile, the Ea fitted at high temperature also decreases to 8.6 meV, suggesting the decrease of gap size because of electron doping. With further cooling down, a sharp superconducting transition with Tc of 2.8 K is clearly seen. This result is reminiscent of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, where the normal state shows semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes superconducting transition below K.2 Interestingly, the first principles calculations7 has suggested that there may be a charge density wave instability or an enhanced correlation effect in this system. Yet, no such instability can be detected merely from the resistivity measurement given in this study. Figure 2 (b) shows the close-up view of the lowtemperature resistivity for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 samples under various magnetic fields below 4 K. The inset gives the temperature dependence of the upper critical field µ0Hc2(T ), determined by using 90% normal state resistivity criterion. The temperature dependence of µ0Hc2(T ) is nearly linear in the temperature range studied. According to Ginzburg-Landau theory, the upper critical field Hc2 evolves with temperature following the formula: Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)(1 -t2)/(1 + t2), (1) where t is the renormalized temperature T/Tc. It is found that the upper critical field Hc2 as drawn can be well fitted by this model and its zero temperature limit is estimated to be 1.04 T. In order to verify the bulk nature of the observed superconductivity, the temperature dependence of d. c. magnetic susceptibility was measured under 5 Oe magnetic field with both zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes for the superconducting samples. The strong diamagnetic signal was observed for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample. The Tc value determined from the magnetic susceptibility agrees well with the one extracted from the resistivity data. The estimated volume fraction of magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 30%, bearing out the bulk superconductivity. Note that the Meissner volume fraction estimated by FC measurement data also exceeds 20%, indicating the high quality superconducting sample. To further study its superconducting properties, the specific heat measurement of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample was performed in the temperature range from 0.5 K to 5 K. As plotted in Fig. 4, a clear specific-heat jump can be observed at Tc = 2.8 K, further confirming the bulk su3 100 300 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 x = 0 m cm T (K) Sr 1-x La x FBiS x = 0.5 (a) 1 3 5 10 30 1 3 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 T (K) Sr 0.5 La 0.5 FBiS 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 m cm T (K) B = 0 T (b) FIG. 2.

Below 1.5 K, however, the low temperature heat capacity undergoes a moderate upturn which very likely arises from Schottky anomaly associated with the impurities phase or the freezing out of La nuclear spins.13 Taking into account the Schottky anomaly component, the overall specific heat can be written as: C/T = γ + βT 2 + α/T 3 (2) where γ and βT 2 account for the electronic and lattice contributions respectively, and the last term, α/T 3, is the Schottky anomaly. The plot of C/T-α/T 3 versus T 2 shows a linear behavior in the high temperature range from 2.9 to 5 K (data not explicitly shown here). The resultant electronic coefficient γ and the lattice coefficient β are 1.42 mJ/ mol K2 and β = 0.414 mJ/ mol K4 respectively. The Debye temperature is then estimated to be 265 K. This value is somewhat smaller that those of LaONiAs,14 LaOFeP15 and LaO0.89F0.11FeAs.16 The lattice contribution was further subtracted in the inset in 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 T (K) ZFC FC H = 5 Oe Sr 0.5 La 0.5 FBiS FIG. 3. (Color online) The diamagnetic signal vs. Temperature under a magnetic field of 5 Oe with ZFC (Solid) and FC(Open) modes for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 order to see the clear specific heat jump at the SC transition. The corresponding electronic specific jump at Tc, therefore, is estimated to be ∆Ce/γTc = 1.4, very close to the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43. Considering the relatively low volume fraction of magnetic shielding suggested from susceptibility measurement, the real size of ∆Ce/γTc ought to be much larger than the BCS value, implying that SC in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 likely involves a strong electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the theoretical prediction.7 1 3 5 5 15 25 1 3 5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 T (K) C e / T C/T (m J.

Finally, the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient RH for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample is shown in Fig. 5. The negative RH signal covers the whole temperature region, indicating that electron-type charge carrier is dominant in this sample.

The result reminds us of the similar behavior observed in iron-based SC, where RH decreases sharply due to spin density wave(SDW) formation.18 In the present sample, however, no SDW/CDW anomaly has been observed in the measurements of resistivity and magnetization. On the other hand, it is known that the inherent impurity phase may act to smear out the anomalies in the resistivity and susceptibility. In this regard, it would be interesting to clarify this problem by first principles calculations7 or further improving the sample quality. In a single band metal, the Hall coefficient RH is associated with carrier density (n) as RH = 1/ne. We therefore estimate the charge carrier density to be 1.05×1019/cm3 at 5 K, which is similar to the Bi4O4S3 system17 and iron based superconductors19 with a very low superfluid density. In addition, we can not rule out the multi-band effect,5 as the origin of the drop in RH. In summary, we study the electron doping effect, i. e., partially substituting La for Sr, in the newly discovered SrFBiS2 system. The parent compound shows semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing temperature. Via electron doping, we discovered a new BiS2based superconductor Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with a Tc as high as 2.8 K. Importantly, this superconductivity was found to develop on the background of insulating normal state, raising a question of whether this superconductor is in proximity to a Mott insulator or a band insulator. Based on the heat capacity measurement, we speculate that the superconducting electron pairs might have a strongcoupled nature. In this regard, it would certainly be interesting to identify the symmetry of superconducting order parameter in this system along with other BiS2based superconductors.
