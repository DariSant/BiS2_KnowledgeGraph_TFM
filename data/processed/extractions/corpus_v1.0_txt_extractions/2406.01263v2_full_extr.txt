In conclusion, we have measured the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient in a single crystal of LaO0.5F0.5Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0∼0.15). The dependences of T* on the Pb concentration measured by various probes are similar to each other. The large anomaly of thermal expansion, shape of the specific heat anomaly, and the existence of hystereses indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T* from the tetragonal symmetry (P4/nmm). The suppression of Tc at x=0.08 near the phase boundary suggests the close relationship between the lattice structure and superconductivity.
