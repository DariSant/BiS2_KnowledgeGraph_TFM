we revealed that the Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 discontinuously increases. Although our sample does not show zero resistivity at ambient pressure, by applying pressure up to 2.44 GPa, maximum Tc onset and Tc zero were observed at 6.7 K and 5 K. The resistivity of both low- and high-Tc phases shows metallic behavior. This is very different from what was seen in the BiS2 system. The γ extremely decreases from 20 to 9.3 after the phase transition, and the resistivity of the normal conducting state in high-Tc phase gradually increases with increasing applied pressure which is in accordance with the BiS2 system. In this current stage, the optimal Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was not observed even at the maximum pressure obtained during this study. Therefore applied further pressure has the potential to induce a much higher Tc in this system.
