In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized BiS2-based CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. MT-curve showed ferromagnetic signal at below 4K. CeOBiS2 sample showed bad metal behavior and Tc = 2.5K has been observed in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. R(T)H of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibited an upper critical field of above 1.2Tesla. We have observed coexistence of ferromagnetic and superconductivity for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. Our results are in confirmation with only report of superconductivity in polycrystalline CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 [8]. Very recently, after submission of this work, an article has appeared on cond-mat arxiv related to single crystal growth of superconducting CeO1-xFxBiS2 with magnetic anomalies in low temperature regime [23].
