In summary, we have successfully synthesized a series of BiS2-based Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 polycrystalline samples. Through the measurements of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility, the parent compound was found to be semiconducting-like with an thermal activation energy Eg ∼38 meV. Via the partial La doping on Sr sites, however, the resistivity decreases sharply, and ultimately superconductivity emerges as x > 0.3 and it reaches Tc of 3.5 K at the optimal level of x = 0.55. The superconducting samples undergo a metal to semiconductor transition/crossover below Tmin, which is seen to be gradually suppressed with further doping whilst Tc remains nearly unchanged above the optimal doping. Hall effect measurements for the La-doped samples confirm that the sign change of RH from positive to negative may be ascribed to the suddenly topology change of the Fermi Surface. A drop in RH and the non-linear transverse resistivity ρxy with field are associated with the multi-band effect or a CDW instability. According to these measurements, an electronic phase diagram is thus established.
