the present first-principles calculations indicate that LaO1-xFxBiS2 changes from a band insulator at x = 0 to a band metal upon doping. Similar to LaFeAsO1-xFx, electrons in LaO1-xFxBiS2 are doped from the LaO(F) redox layer to the superconducting BiS2 layers. The p-orbital states of Bi-S1 layers play an important role in the electron transformation due to their domination of the DOS at the Fermi level. From the phonon calculations for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we obtain a strong electron-phonon coupling of λ = 0.8 and a superconducting transition temperature of Tc = 9.1 K, the latter being very close to its experimental value. It then follows that LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a conventional electron-phonon superconductor. For LaO1-xFxBiS2, we have shown that the electronic states near the Fermi level are dominantly from the hybridized p orbital states of the Bi and S1 atoms, and the electron-phonon coupling comes mainly from the contribution of the Bi and S phonons. These facts indicate that the BiS2 layers play an important role in the transport and superconducting properties, similar to the CuO2 layers of the cuprates or Fe-As layers of the Fe-based superconductors.
