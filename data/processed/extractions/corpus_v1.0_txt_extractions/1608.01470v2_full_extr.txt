We synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system, Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, with the expecting of the emergence of bulk superconductivity by in-plane chemical pressure effect. Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex with x = 0˗1 were synthesized by solid state reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that Se selectively occupied at the in-plane Ch1 site, and hence, in-plane chemical pressure was enhanced. For x ≥ 0.6, superconducting transitions with a large shielding volume fraction were observed in -T measurements, and the highest Tc was 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From -T measurements, a zero-resistivity state was observed for all the samples, and the highest Tc was observed for x = 0.8. With increasing Se concentration, characteristics of -T changed from semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk superconductivity is linked with the enhanced metallicity via in-plane chemical pressure. A superconductivity phase diagram of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor was established. The -T data under high magnetic fields were analyzed with assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field, which indicated local in-plane distortion may result in the high-Tc onset, obviously higher than the bulk Tc.
