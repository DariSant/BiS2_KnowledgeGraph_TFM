We have synthesized novel BiS2-based superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0 ~ 0.7 using solid-state reaction and high-pressure post annealing. As compared to the LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples prepared using only solid-state reaction, the lattice constants of the high-pressure samples were smaller. Superconducting transition was observed for x = 0.2 ~ 0.7, and the optimal superconducting properties were obtained for x = 0.5 with the Tc onset exceeding 10 K. The phase diagram showed an x-dependent superconducting dome. The evolution of dome-shaped dependence resembled the x dependence of the a axis. This may indicate that the correlation between the Tc and the a axis is essential for BiS2-based superconductivity.
