We have reported the sulfur isotope effect on Tc in Bi4O4S3 with 32S and 34S. Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared by solid-state reaction using 32S and 34S isotope chemicals. To investigate the isotope effect, six samples having similar lattice constants were selected. From magnetization analyses, the isotope exponent was estimated as -0.1 < S < 0.1. Although the Tc estimated from electrical resistivity was scattered as compared to those estimated from the magnetization, we observed no clear correlation between Tc and the isotope mass. The present results on the isotope effect suggest Bi4O4S3 to be an unconventional superconductor.
