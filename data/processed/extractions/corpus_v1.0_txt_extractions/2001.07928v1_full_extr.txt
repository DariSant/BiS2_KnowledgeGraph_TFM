We have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system CeOBiS2-xSex, which shows a bulk superconductivity when local structural parameters and carrier concentration were both optimized by Se substitution. Polycrystalline samples of CeOBiS2-xSex with x = 0-1.0 were synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that inplane chemical pressure was enhanced, and the in-plane disorder was suppressed by Se substitution. BVS calculation showed that the valence of Ce ions decreased by Se substitution. For x = 0.4 and 0.6, a superconducting transition with a large shielding volume fraction was observed in magnetic susceptibility measurements, and the highest Tc was 3 K for x = 0.6. From electrical resistivity measurements, a zero-resistivity state was observed for x = 0.2-0.8, and the highest Tc was observed for x = 0.6. Since the CeOBiS1.4Se0.6 superconductor has less disorder in the CeO blocking layer owing to no substitution, this superconducting material should be useful for experiments to probe mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds.
