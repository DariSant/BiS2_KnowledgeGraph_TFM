we have investigated the in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis magnetoresistance of single crystals of a BiCh2-based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe under inplane field configuration. We observed two-fold symmetry of the c-axis magnetoresistance in the ab plane of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe while the conducting plane possessed a tetragonal square plane with four-fold symmetry. We consider that the observed in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis magnetoresistance would be due to electronic (or orbital) origins and not due to structural origins. The observed two-fold symmetry is possibly related to the nematic states, which have been observed in the superconducting states of several unconventional superconductors with a layered structure.
