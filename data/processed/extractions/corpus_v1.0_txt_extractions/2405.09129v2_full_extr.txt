We investigated the aging effects on crystal structural, decomposition, and superconducting properties of BiS2-based compounds Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 using XRD and magnetization measurements. For the Bi4O4S3 sample, no aging effect on XRD was observed, and quite small decrease in Tc (0.2 K) was observed for the 12-years-old sample. As a conclusion, there is almost no aging effects in Bi4O4S3. In contrast, the HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample exhibits a clear aging effect in magnetization data. Tirr decreases from 9.4 to 7.0 K. Because the high-pressuresynthesized sample contain high-pressure strain effects, the aging effects on superconducting properties were observed in 10-years-old samples. As a conclusion, the BiS2-based compounds are stable and their superconducting properties are also robust to aging in air. However, the highpressure strain effects exhibit aging.
