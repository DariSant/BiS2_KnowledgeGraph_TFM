In summary, we report a discovery of a new layered fluorosulfide SrFBiS2. It contains NaCl-type BiS2 layer similar to Bi4O4S3 and Ln(O, F)BiS2 superconductors. SrFBiS2 polycrystals shows semiconducting behavior between 2 K and 300 K. We observe rather small thermal conductivity and large TEP with sign reversal at low temperature. Theoretical calculation confirms the semiconducting behavior and indicates similar DOS and band structure to undoped LaOBiS2. Because of the similarity between SrFBiS2 and the parent compound of BiS2-based superconductors, it is of interest to investigate the doping effects on physical properties of SrFBiS2. It could pave a way to new members in this emerging family of BiS2-based superconductors.
