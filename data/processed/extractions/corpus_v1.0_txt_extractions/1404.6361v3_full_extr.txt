We investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of the As-grown and HP samples of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. We found that both As-grown and HP samples show bulk superconductivity. The lattice constant of a and c axis does not show a remarkable differences between the As-grown and HP samples. Nevertheless, the peak symmetry of the (200) peak seems to become more symmetric by high-pressure annealing while the (004) peak does not show such a difference, indicating that the crystal structure within the ab plane changed to a higher-symmetric phase, more perfect tetragonal, by high-pressure annealing in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. The Tc of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 increased from Tc zero = 2.7 K to Tc zero = 3.7 K by high-pressure annealing. We assume that the increase in Tc could be explained by a change in the crystal structure symmetry within the ab plane or optimization of the local atomic coordinates without any changes in lattice constants.
