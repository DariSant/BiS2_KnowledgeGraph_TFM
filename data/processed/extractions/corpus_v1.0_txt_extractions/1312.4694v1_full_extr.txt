We have synthesized the polycrystalline samples of new layered bismuth-sulfide LaO1-xFxBiS2. To investigate the thermoelectric properties, the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient at high temperature up to 480 ºC were measured. LaOBiS2 showed a metallic behavior of electrical resistivity above 270 K while it showed a semiconducting behavior below 270 K. It was found that the value of the electrical resistivity decreased with F substitution. The Seebeck coefficient decreased with increasing F concentration. The highest power factor of 1.9 µW/cmK2 at 480 ºC was obtained for LaOBiS2. Although the obtained power factor was lower than those of the thermoelectric materials on practical use, we will be able to improve the thermoelectric properties by manipulating the blocking layer in the BiS2-based
