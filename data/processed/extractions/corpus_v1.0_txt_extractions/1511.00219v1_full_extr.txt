The growth of R(O, F)BiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) single crystals was achieved by using CsCl/KCl flux containing varying rare earth metals and F compositions. The characterization of the obtained single crystals clarified the detailed crystal structures, transport properties, and magnetic properties. An increase in the nominal F compositions in the starting materials was found to enhance the values of F concentration in the obtained single crystals. On increasing the nominal F composition, the analytical F composition also increased and reached saturation at 0.45 (R = La), 0.29 (R = Ce), 0.26 (R = Pr), and 0.42 (R = Nd) when the nominal F composition exceeded around 0.6. The Bi-S planes of the R(O, F)BiS2 single crystals became flatter with increasing F concentration, according to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The superconducting anisotropies of the obtained single crystals were estimated to be 30-60 when R = La, Pr and Nd. The anisotropy was especially high for R = Pr, whereas the value was lower than expected (13-21) when R = Ce. Ce(O, F)BiS2 single crystals exhibited a magnetic order at about 5-7 K in addition to the superconducting transition at approximately 3 K, which suggested that the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Ce(O, F)BiS2 was intrinsic. The s-shaped junction of Pr(O, F)BiS2 single crystal with x = 0.3 and y = 0.18 under a magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane of the crystal exhibited a "lock-in" state for Josephson vortex flow.
