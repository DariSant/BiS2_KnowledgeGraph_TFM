La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a four-layer-type Bi-based compound that shows insulating transport properties at low temperatures. Hence, in this study, we have investigated the effects of Se substitution on the structural, transport, and superconducting properties of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. Owing to Se doping, the normal state electrical resistivity at low temperatures was drastically suppressed, and superconductivity at a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.15 K was observed for x = 0.5. Tc increased with increasing Se concentration: Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0. According to XRD analyses, we proposed that Se was substituted for the in-plane S1 site in the BiS2 layers. Both the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall coefficient suggested that electrons were the dominant carriers. From the Hall coefficient, carrier concentration was estimated. Owing to Se substitution, the concentration of mobile carriers increased considerably; this could be related to the suppression of carrier localization caused by Se substitution. On the basis of the obtained results and the discussion based on the analogy of two-layer-type systems, the emergence of metallicity and superconductivity was explained by the in-plane chemical pressure effects. The estimated Bc2(0) was 0.76 and 1.15 T for x = 0.5 and 1.0, respectively. The demonstration of metallicity and superconductivity in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-based compounds can be useful for further development of four-layer-type Bi-based superconductors.
