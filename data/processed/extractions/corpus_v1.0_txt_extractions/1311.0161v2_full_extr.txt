The novel BiS2 based superconductor consists of a layered crystal structure built from BiS2 layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1-x block layers, where x indicates the deficiency of SO4 2- ions at interlayer sites [3]. Within few weeks, several other BiS2-based superconductors, with composition ReO1-xFxBiS2 (Re = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) [4-7] appeared, with Tc as high as 10 K. Evidently, these compounds have a common BiS2 layer, which serves as the basic building blocks of this new superconducting family. The carrier doping mechanism in the new BiS2 based superconductors is seemingly the same as for the high Tc cuprates and Fe-Pnictides [4-10]. There are some doubts about the exact crystal structure and superconducting composition of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor [8]. A recent extensive study of these compounds showed that Bi4O4S3 is actually a two-phased material [9]. The two phases are namely Bi2OS2 and Bi3O2S3 and most likely the later one exhibits the superconductivity. Theoretical studies indicated that the Fermi level lies within the conduction bands, which are originating from the Bi 6p orbitals in the BiS2 layer [11-13]. Also exotic multi-band behavior has been reported in the Hall coefficient measurements and it is shown that the charge carriers are mainly electron-type [14]. The chemical doping in the main phase of these superconducting compounds could be a powerful way to increase their Tc and to understand possible mechanism of superconductivity. In one report, Ag has been doped in Bi4O4S3 compound and it is shown that the lattice shrinks gradually with Ag doping and the Tc is suppressed [15]. Keeping in view that there exists only scant reports [15] on the on-site substitution in Bi4O4S3, we report here the effect of Se substitution at S site in bulk polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex (x=0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15). All the studied samples are crystallized in near single phase and the superconductivity is seen to decrease with increase in Se content. For higher (x > 0.15) content of Se in Bi4O4S3-xSex, the resultant material becomes clearly multi phase and the on-site substitution was not possible. It is shown that, Se doping at S site has detrimental effect on superconductivity of Bi4O4S3. Experimental Polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples are synthesized by standard solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Bi, S, Bi2O3, and Se are weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in a quartz tube. Sealed quartz ampoules are placed in Box furnace and heat treated at 4000C for 10h with the typical heating rate of 2oC/minute, and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of six hours to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-60o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed using the standard FullProf program. The electrical transport and magnetization measurements were performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) as a function of both temperature and applied magnetic field. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refined XRD patterns at a room temperature for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples. Reported Wyckoff positions [2] and space group I4/mmm with the tetragonal structure are used to refine the XRD pattern. Some impurities of Bi and Bi2S3 are also seen in the main phase of the Bi4O4S3. The content of Bi2S3 phase slightly increases with increase in Se content. The refined lattice constants of Bi4O4S3 are a = 3.9708(2) Ǻ and c = 41.357(1) Ǻ, and the same slightly increases to a = 3.9717(1) Ǻ and c = 41.419(3) Ǻ for x = 0.15 sample. It is clear from XRD data the lattice slightly expands due to bigger ion Se doping at S site. Temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibility (M-T) data under 10 Oe magnetic field for the studied Bi4O4S3-xSex samples are shown in Figure 2(a). Magnetization measurements are performed in both ZFC (Zero Field Cool) and FC (Field Cool) modes. Clear diamagnetic transitions are seen at around 4.4 K for Bi4O4S3, 4.2 K for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, 3.7 K for Bi4O4S2.91Se0.09, and 3.5 K for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that though all studied samples show superconductivity, but the Tc is decreasing with increasing Se doping level. Below Tc, the bifurcation of the FC and ZFC data is simply due to the complicated magnetic flux pinning effects. Both the FC and ZFC magnetization data confirmed the appearance of bulk superconductivity in Bi4O4S3-xSex samples. Figure 2(b), represents the AC magnetic susceptibility of the Bi4O4S3 sample, confirming the bulk superconductivity at around 4.5 K. The AC magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out at 333 Hz and varying amplitude of 5 - 13 Oe. It can be seen from Fig. 2b, that the imaginary part peak height is increased along with increased diamagnetism in real part of AC susceptibility with change in amplitude from 5-13 Oe. The interesting part is that with increasing AC amplitude the imaginary part peak position temperature (4.5 K) is not changed. This indicates, that the superconducting grains are well coupled and hence nearly no grain boundary contribution in the superconductivity of Bi4O4S3. Inset of the Fig. 2b depicts the Real part of AC susceptibility being measured at applied DC bias fields of up to 4 kOe at temperature 2 K. The upper critical field (Hc2) being determined from in-field AC susceptibility measurements, is 0.5 kOe and 1.973 kOe with 50% and 90% diamagnetism criteria, respectively. The Resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) plots for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples in zero magnetic field are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen from the ρ-T plots that resistivity increases slightly with increasing of Se doping. All samples showed superconductivity, with Tc onset of 4.5 K for Bi4O4S3 and 4.0 K for the x = 0.15. This indicates that the superconductivity is suppressed with the Se doping in the Bi4O4S3-xSex compounds. It is clear indication that the superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 compound is not due to Bi impurity. This is because the Bi content is fixed for all samples and the substitution is done only at S site. Inset of the Figure 3 shows the temperature dependent resistivity in expanded temperature range of 300 - 2.2 K. It can be seen that the all samples exhibit metallic behavior with slightly increasing resistivity for Se doped compounds. Figure 4 (a), (b), and (c) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity under applied magnetic field for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples. Superconductivity is seen at below 4.5K for pristine Bi4O4S3 and the same decreases with Se doping. With increasing applied magnetic field, though both the Tc onset and Tc (ρ = 0) are gradually shifted to lower temperatures, but the shift is comparatively more for the later. This results in broadening of the superconducting transition under applied field, which is similar to the high-Tc layered cuprates and Fe-pnictide superconductors [16, 17]. Figure 5 exhibits the temperature dependent of upper critical field (Hc2) for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples. The Hc2 is evaluated by using resistivity drops to 90% of its normal state value i. e., ρn(T, H) at above Tc onset. The conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) equation Hc2(0) = - 0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc has been used to evaluate Hc2. Thus calculated upper critical field Hc2 WHH(0) is 2.3 Tesla for Bi4O4S3, 2.1 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, and 1.8 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that the Hc2 is decreasing with increase in Se doping concentration. The temperature derivative of resistivity (dρ/dT) for the three superconducting samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) are shown in Fig. 6 (a), (b) and (c) respectively. Though dρ/dT peak is broadened with field yet only a single transition peak is observed, suggesting better grains coupling in these systems. The broadening of the resistive transition under applied magnetic field can be seen in terms of dissipation energy caused by the motion of vortices in the mixed state. This suggests that superconducting onset is relatively less affected than the Tc (ρ = 0) state. The transition broadening is caused by the creep of vortices, which are thermally activated. The temperature dependence of resistivity in this region is governed by Arrhenius equation [18], ρ(T, B) = ρ0 exp[- U0/kBT] (1) Here, ρ0 is the field independent pre-exponential factor, kB is the Boltzmann's constant and U0 is thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) activation energy. Activation energy can be obtained from the fitted low temperature resistivity data with the Arrhenius equation. Figs. 7(a), (b) and (c) show the experimental data in terms of ln(ρ) vs. T-1 along with the fitting to equation 1. The best fitted data give values of the activation energies to be 18.60 meV for Bi4O4S3, 13.69 meV for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03 and 13.16 meV for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15 samples in applied magnetic field of 200 Oe. In low field region, though the activation energy shows weak dependence i. e. U0/kB ~ H-0.35, but is strongly dependent in high field range as U0/kB ~ H-0.85, it could be clearly seen that the field dependence of U0 is different for lower and higher field ranges. This has been observed earlier for some other superconductors as well [16, 17]. In summery we have synthesized near single phase bulk polycrystalline samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) compounds and it is found that the S site Se doping deteriorates superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 system.
