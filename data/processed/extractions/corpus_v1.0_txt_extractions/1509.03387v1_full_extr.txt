we investigated the thermoelectric properties of a densified HP-LaOBiSSe sample. A weak crystal oriented was revealed by XRD analysis. The power factor in the direction of P was higher than that in the direction of P//, which is caused by the enhanced in-plane electrical conductivity. The temperature dependence of  in the direction of both P and P// was anisotropic. The  values measured in the direction of P// were much lower than that measured in the direction of P direction. The low  values in the direction of P// were caused by the low  values in the direction of the c-axis of the HP-LaOBiSSe crystal structure. The highest ZT value of 0.36 was obtained in both measurement directions at approximately 650
