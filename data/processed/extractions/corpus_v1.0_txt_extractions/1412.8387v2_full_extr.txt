single crystals of La(O, F)BiSSe have been prepared using the CsCl flux method. La(O, F)BiSSe crystalized with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1110(2) Å, c = 13.6010(7) Å). The single crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that the apical site of the Bi-SSe pyramid in the superconducting layer is selectively occupied by S atoms. The magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements showed a clear superconducting transition at around 4.2 K. The superconducting anisotropic parameter was determined to be 34-35 from its upper critical magnetic field.
