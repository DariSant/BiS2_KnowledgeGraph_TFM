We have systematically investigated the crystal structure and magnetic properties of BiS2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) to investigate the chemical pressure effects on superconductivity of the REO1-yFyBiS2 systems. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 samples, bulk superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.5 with y = 0.5 and x = 1.0 with y = 0.3. The Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity. The Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 commonly increases with increasing Nd concentration. The highest Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the systematic substitution of Ce by Nd generates chemical pressure along the a axis while c axis does not show a remarkable change on Nd concentration. The lattice constants of c get shorter with increasing F concentration. This result indicates the partial substitution of O by F generates lattice contraction along c axis. Furthermore, we found that Nd can be replaced by smaller Sm ions, up to z = 0.8. Bulk superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 with y = 0.3 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 with y = 0.5. The Tc onset in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 increased with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 5.6 K for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. The Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity within a range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.4. With increasing Sm concentration, the lattice constant of a decreases while the lattice constant of c does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm concentration. The lattice constant of a in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is shorter than that of the shortest value of the lattice constant of a in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. This indicates that the effect of chemical pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is clearly larger than that in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. We established a three kinds of phase diagram for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). On the basis of the phase diagrams, both lattice contraction of a axis and optimal F concentration are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity in REO1-yFyBiS2. Furthermore, the c/a ratio of the higher Tc samples is concentrated at near c/a = 3.39. Within this region, the chemical pressure along the a axis is the strongest in the studied samples. Therefore, both uniaxial contraction along the a axis generated by chemical pressure and optimal F concentration are important for the inducement of bulk superconductivity with a higher Tc in the REO1-yFyBiS2 superconductors.
