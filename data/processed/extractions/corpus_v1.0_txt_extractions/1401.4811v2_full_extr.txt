In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized BiS2-based superconductor NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1-0.9) by solid state vacuum encapsulation technique. Reitveld refinement of XRD pattern show that all the samples are crystallized in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group and the lattice parameters decrease with the F-doping. The bulk superconductivity with maximum Tc of 5.25K and nearly 100% shielding volume fraction at 2K is seen for nominal x=0.7. Electrical resistivity measurements showed that under applied magnetic field both Tc onset and Tc (ρ =0) decrease to lower temperatures and an upper critical field Hc2(0) of above 3Tesla is estimated for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. The activation energy in the magnetic field range 0.02 to 2Tesla has been estimated from 62.66meV to 0.12meV. Hall measurement results indicated dominance of electron charge carriers in this compound.
