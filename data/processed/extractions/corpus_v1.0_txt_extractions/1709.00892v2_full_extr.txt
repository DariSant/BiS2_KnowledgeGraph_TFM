S - In summary, we have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system La1xCexOBiSSe. Polycrystalline samples for x = 00.9 were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Crystal structure analysis showed that both lattice constants a and c decrease with increasing x. BVS calculation and magnetization measurements showed mixed valence states of Ce ions in 10 0 1000 2000  -1 (mol emu -1) T (K) x = 0.1 H = 10000 Oe Fig. 7: (Color online) Temperature (T) dependences of reciprocal susceptibility (1) of La1xCexOBiSSe (x = 0.1) measured at 1 T. Red solid lines represent the CurieWeiss fitting lines. Analogous data of other samples are shown in Fig. S3 in Supporting Information. F. Firstauthorfamilyname et al. these compounds. Carrier doping into BiCh2 conducting layer by Ce substitution is confirmed by the measurements of S. Metallic-like T plots were observed for x  0.1. Zero resistivity and clear diamagnetic signal corresponding to bulk superconductivity were obtained for x = 0.20.6. A domeshaped superconductivity phase diagram, with the highest Tc of 3.1 K for x = 0.30.5, was established. This work clearly showed the emergence of bulk superconductivity and metallic conductivity via mixed valence state of Ce ions in BiCh2based layered compounds. ***
