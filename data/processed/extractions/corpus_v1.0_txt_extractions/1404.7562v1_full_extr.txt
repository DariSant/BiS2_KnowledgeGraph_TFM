In summary, a layered compound LaOBiSSe was synthesized by solid-state reaction method. By F-doping at the O site which induces electron carriers, this compound can be much easily turned into superconducting with a higher Tc than the F-doped LaOBiS2 superconductors. The F-doping effect was systematically studied, which introduce electron carriers and causes lattice shrinkage mainly along the c-axis of the crystal lattice, and lead to a highest Tc of 3.8 K in the optimally doped LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe superconductor.
