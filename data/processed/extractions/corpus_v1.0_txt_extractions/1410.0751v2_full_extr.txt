We have successfully synthesized SmO1-xFxBiS2 which is a new member of the F-doped LnOBiS2 family. This material is non superconducting and paramagnetic down to 2 K. We have investigated the structure and properties of the Sm substituted materials La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 - 1.0) with Sm3+ ions smaller in size as compared with La3+-ions and thus simulating chemical pressure as one effect of the substitution. Structural distortion in the Bi-S plane was analyzed. We find that the Bi-S bond lengths decrease with the increase in the doping level of the smaller Sm ion at the La site. We have observed superconductivity in La1-y SmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 - 0.8) and we find that Tc is gradually enhanced upon doping Sm at the La site as y→ 0.8. Absence of superconductivity in SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is anomalous and deserves to be investigated. We also think that a tuning between these parameters via suitable doping or applied pressure could lead to superconductivity in SmO1-xFxBiS2. ASSOCIATED CONTENT
