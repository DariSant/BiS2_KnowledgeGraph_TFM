our ARPES results show two small electronlike FSs around X (π, 0) instead of large hole-like FSs centered at Γ (0, 0) and M (π, π) proposed in recent theoretical models. The anomalous temperature dependence of the low-energy spectrum indicates that the superconducting pairing develops in a highly interacting electronic state. Our results provide detailed information on the low-energy electronic structures and valuable insights for further experimental and theoretical studies of the pairing mechanism in the BiS2based superconductors.
