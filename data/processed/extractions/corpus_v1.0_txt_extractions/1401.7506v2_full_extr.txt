we investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of As-grown and high-pressure-annealed PrO0.5F0.5BiS2. We found that high-pressure annealing generates uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis. Both As-grown and high-pressure-annealed PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 show bulk superconductivity. The Tc of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is clearly increased from Tc zero = 3.6 K to Tc zero = 5.5 K by high-pressure annealing. Unexpectedly, the semiconducting characteristics are relatively enhanced by high-pressure annealing. Namely, we assume that the increase in Tc cannot be explained by an increase in the number electron carriers. Having considered these facts, we conclude that the increase in Tc correlates with the uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2.
