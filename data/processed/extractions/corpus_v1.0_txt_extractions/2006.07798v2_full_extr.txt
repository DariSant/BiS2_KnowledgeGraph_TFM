We have investigated low-temperature crystal structure of BiCh2-based compounds LaO1xFxBiSSe (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.5). From SXRD experiments, a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic was observed for x = 0 and 0.01. For x = 0.03, a structural transition and broadening of the diffraction peak were not observed down to 100 K. These facts suggest that the structural transition could be suppressed by 3% F substitution in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Furthermore, from XRD experiments at T = 4 K, the crystal structure for x = 0.5 at 4 K was determined as tetragonal. The structural phase diagram obtained in this study suggests that the origin of the two-fold symmetric inplane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is not structural one but another electronic one.
