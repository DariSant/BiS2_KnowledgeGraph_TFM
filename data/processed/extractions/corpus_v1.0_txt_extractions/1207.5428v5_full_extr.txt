we have synthesized the new layered sulfide Bi4O4S3 superconductor and established its bulk superconductivity by magnetization and transport measurements. Detailed Reitveld analysis determines the molecular composition as Bi3O3S2.25. The coherence length is estimated to be ~100Å. A departure from strong electron-electron correlation in the normal state is indicated. The Hall resistivity yields non-linear magnetic field dependence.
