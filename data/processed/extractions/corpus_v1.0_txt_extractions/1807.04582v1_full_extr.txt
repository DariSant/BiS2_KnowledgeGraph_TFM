we reported the observation of superconductivity (Tczero = 0.5 K) in the polycrystalline sample of layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6. In the temperature dependence of resistivity, an anomaly possibly related to the CDW transition (T *∼180 K) is observed. The La2O2Bi3AgS6 and related La2O2M4S6 systems will be useful to discuss the universal relationship between superconductivity and CDW states and to develop new CDW-related superconductors.
