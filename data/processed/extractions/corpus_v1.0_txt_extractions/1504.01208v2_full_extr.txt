To discuss the relationship between Tc and in-plane chemical pressure, we plotted Tc for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 as a function of in-plane chemical pressure in Fig. 4. To obtain a general tendency in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors, we added data points for Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 [analyzed in this study], NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [38], PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 [16], SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [18], and LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 (y = 1) single crystal [39]. Interestingly, data points for all the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type are located on a single slope highlighted by a blue region. Notably, the data points for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 and SmO0.5F0.5BiS2, which do not exhibit superconductivity, locate on the left region of the boundary suggested in Fig. 4 (in-plane chemical pressure < 1.011). These facts suggest that the emergence of superconductivity and Tc of REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type simply depend on degree of in-plane chemical pressure. If we consider the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory with electron-phonon mechanisms [40], the enhancement of Tc would be explained by an increase of phonon frequency and/or an enhancement of density of state at the Fermi level. Generally in metals, an increase in overlap of orbitals should decrease density of state due to an increase of band width. Therefore, an increase in density of state could not simply explain the enhancement of Tc in this series. Although phonon frequency might be enhanced with increasing in-plane chemical pressure, further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the enhancement of Tc with increasing in-plane chemical pressure. Notably, Tc for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 and LaOBiSe2, indicated with a red region, are clearly located on a lower side of that for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type series. As an important fact, evolutions of Tc in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 do not correspond and exhibit different curves. For the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 compounds, in-plane chemical pressure is relatively stronger than that in REO0.5F0.5BiS2, but their Tc is clearly lower than those of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As described above, Se preferably occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Therefore, it can be considered that superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is induced in a Bi-(S, Se) or a Bi-Se plane. If we assume the BCS theory, the lower Tc in Bi-Se plane can be explained by a lower phonon frequency in Bi-Se plane than that in Bi-S plane due to the larger atomic number of Se. In order to confirm the assumption above and mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based family, we need to obtain other REO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductors like CeO0.5F0.5BiSe2 or NdO0.5F0.5BiSe2 and add data points on an extension of the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 series. As a conclusion with Fig. 4, we expect that a higher Tc would be obtained with Bi-S plane with a higher in-plane chemical pressure in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2-type compounds. At the end, we briefly discuss about the HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 which shows the highest Tc among BiCh2-based superconductors [13,28-32]. T. Tomita et al. reported that the crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 above 0.7 GPa was monoclinic [31]. In the monoclinic structure, the Bi-S1 plane is distorted into a zigzag chain with a shorter Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å; zigzag chains are connected with a longer Bi-S1 distance of 3.03 Å to each other. In fact, we reported in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field within the Bi-S1 plane in a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, implying the emergence of quasi-one-dimensional superconducting states within the distorted Bi-S1 plane of a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [41]. If we simply calculate the value of chemical pressure using a Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å with the equation (1), we obtain chemical pressure of 1.06. (In this case, obtained chemical pressure is not in-plane chemical pressure but quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure.) Chemical pressure of 1.06 and Tc of 10 K give a data point locating on a rough extension of the Tc-chemical pressure curve for the other REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors discussed in Fig. 4. This might indicate that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure, not in-plane chemical pressure, would be essential for the evolution of superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds. To further discuss and understand the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in the BiCh2 family, investigations of crystal structure and superconducting properties for new BiS2-, BiSe2-based and/or BiTe2-based compounds with various spacer layers are needed. In summary, we have analyzed crystal structure of optimally-doped BiCh2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using powder synchrotron XRD to reveal relationship between crystal structure and superconducting properties in BiCh2-based layered compounds. We have found that the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure could commonly induce bulk superconductivity in both systems. Furthermore, we revealed that Tc for the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors could be determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure and a kind of Ch element composing superconducting Bi-Ch planes. In addition, on the basis of discussion on the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds and a monoclinic phase (high pressure phase) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we suggest a possibility that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure within a Bi-Ch chain, not in-plane (two-dimensional) chemical pressure, would be essential for a higher Tc in BiCh2-based superconductors. Methods Polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 used in this study were prepared using solid state reaction. The detailed synthesis procedures were described in previous reports [33,34]. Powder synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed at room temperature at the BL02B2 experimental station of SPring-8 (JASRI; Proposal No. 2014B1003 and 2014B1071). The wavelength of the radiation beam was 0.49542(4) Å. We have performed the Rietveld refinement (RIETAN-FP [42]) for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using a typical structure model of REOBiCh2-based superconductor with a tetragonal space group of P4/nmm [36,37]. Contributions from impurity phases of rare-earth fluorides (REF3) and/or Bi2S3 are included in Rietveld refinement. In addition, we have analyzed a crystal structure for two related compounds of Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 to enrich the discussion part [33]. The obtained crystal structure parameters are summarized in Table S1. The schematic images of crystal structure were drawn using VESTA [43].
