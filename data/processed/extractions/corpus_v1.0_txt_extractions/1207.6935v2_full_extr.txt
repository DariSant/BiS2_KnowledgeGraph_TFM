we have measured the electrical resistivity under pressure for the BiS2 based layered superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Tc in metallic Bi4O4S3 decreases monotonically with increasing pressure, whereas Tc in semiconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 initially increases and then decreases upon approaching the metallic region. The strong suppression of the semiconducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the Fermi surface is in the vicinity of some instability. It is plausible that the Fermi level is located near the edge of the conduction band. This indicates that superconductivity is realized in the complex Fermi surface including the impurity band with a low carrier density and a low density of states, and it rather provides benefit for achieving a higher Tc.
