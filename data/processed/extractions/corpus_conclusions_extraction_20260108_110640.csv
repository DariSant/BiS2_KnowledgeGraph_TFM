The F-concentration dependence of structural properties indicates that the O/F solubility limit seems to be near x = 0.5. A superconducting transition is observed for x (nominal) ≥ 0.5. However the shielding volume fraction in the magnetic susceptibility measurement is only 13.4 % for the best sample of x = 0.5 (AP2), which implies that the electron doping level is in the under-doped region of this system. Therefore, we performed the high pressure annealing to achieve further doping of F. Figure 5 shows the XRD profiles near the (102) and (004) peaks. The (004) peak slightly shifts to higher angles after high pressure annealing, indicating that the c axis decreases. This change indicates that the F concentration increased by the high pressure annealing. As described in 3-1, the x = 0.5 (AP2) sample contains small amount of BiF3 and LaF3. The F ions would be supplied from the impurity fluorides. With the fact that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by a slight increase of F concentration from x = 0.5, we guess the optimal doping level is slightly above x = 0.5. The estimated optimal doping level is comparable to that of Bi4O4S3. Therefore, we will be able to achieve bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2 by optimizing the carrier doping techniques or modifying the optimal doping level (band structure) by changing the spacer layer structures. In conclusion, we have discovered a new type of BiS2-based superconductor LaO1-xFxBiS2 with a Tc as high as 10.6 K. This superconductor has a layered structure analogous to the BiS2-based Bi4O4S3 superconductor, suggesting that the BiS2 layer is a basic structure which provides new layered superconducting family like CuO2 plane of cuprates and Fe2An2 layers of Fe-based family. Furthermore, we note that the spacer layer of LaOBiS2 is almost the same as that of LaOFeAs, which is the first FeAs-based system. Thus, we will be able to discover many BiS2-based superconductors on the basis of the analogy to FeAs-based compounds. We expect that the novel superconductors with the BiS2 superconducting layers will open a new field in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.

A weak insulating behavior is induced in the normal state when a high magnetic field is applied. This can be induced either by an adjacent competing order, or the very shallow px and py band and small Fermi energy. Both the strong non-linear Hall effect and the magnetoresistance indicate the multiband feature. A kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity at all high magnetic fields when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed. This kink can be well traced back to the upper critical field Hc2(T ) in the low field region. We argue that the superconducting pairing, for some reason, could be very strong and occur first in the one dimensional chains, then the bulk superconductivity is established through the Josephson coupling between them. We appreciate the useful discussions with Qianghua Wang and Jianxin Li.

The strong suppression of the semiconducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the Fermi surface is in the vicinity of some instability. It is plausible that the Fermi level is located near the edge of the conduction band.

Quality-improved polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 was successfully prepared by an HP method, and the lattice parameters and normal-state ρ, as well as the density of states at the Fermi level, were found to be comparable to those determined previously. The most notable discovery in this study was the impurity-driven SC (>1.6 K) in Bi4O4S3, which contradicted the results of ongoing studies of this compound. There are two possible reasons for the above-mentioned discrepancy: (i) common technical errors, including those related to the presence of a superconducting impurity, in ongoing studies. The impurity was found to show zero resistivity, even though its superconducting shielding fraction was smaller than 0.3%; (ii) slight local structure and chemical composition differences between the HP phase and the superconducting phase of Bi4O4S3, including a small variation of the S1-Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer, as detected in this study. The concentrations of vacancies of the SO4 group in the layered structure of Bi4O4S3 might also vary upon HP heating. If the latter is true, the HP phase can be a host material for the superconducting phase. Although we cannot discuss the possible structure or composition variations of Bi4O4S3 in more detail because neutron diffraction studies are required, we conclude that the SC of the HP-prepared Bi4O4S3 is most likely impurity-driven. The relative sample scale to the λL hardly accounted for the negligible superconducting shielding fraction, as evidenced by the magnetic susceptibility measurements at a magnetic field of 1 Oe as well as of 10 Oe on a mm-size HP sample. Hence, the full shielding fraction reported in ongoing studies1-3) was possibly complicated by a superconducting link consisting of similar superconducting impurities throughout the grain boundaries and at the surface in a synthesized pellet as evidenced by marked decreases in the shielding fraction at a magnetic field of 1 Oe (<< Hc1) even upon gentle grinding. Although the various forms of the superconducting link could play a fundamental role in the observed SC, it was highly challenging to identify the chemical composition and structure of the superconducting impurities because partially melted phases can be essential in the formation of the superconducting link (Bi melting point: 272 °C and S melting point: 115.2 °C). Although the Bi powder treated in the same heating procedure as the reference was not superconducting above 2 K, multiple phases were superconducting at the highest Tc of 8.2 K.10) Thus, neighbor materials in solid and amorphous forms should be carefully studied for relevance to the observed SC. In addition, the surface of the BiS2 layered phase might be altered under the presence of liquid phases during the heating process, resulting in the appearance of possible surface superconductivity. No matter which, the observed superconductivity did not truly reflect the bulk nature of the BiS2 layered phase, regardless of the manner in which the Bi4O4S3 compound is synthesized. Since the difficulty in identifying the superconducting impurities complicates ongoing studies, further experimental efforts toward measuring the degree of impact from impurities and possible altered particle surfaces on the observed SC would be needed to correctly characterize the BiS2 layered phase. 11",section_header,4.

Chalcogenides tend to crystallize in a layered structure; hence, the intercalations/deintercalations of ions or molecules at the interlayer site dramatically changes the physical properties and induces exotic superconductivity. The most remarkable family is the Fe chalcogenides, which is the simplest Fe-based superconductor. In this series, the key factors to induce superconductivity are the suppression of antiferromagnetism of Fe planes and the reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe at the interlayer site. The later, reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe can be achieved by oxygen intercalation via annealing in oxygen condition or deintercalation of excess Fe via annealing in acid. Interestingly, red wine is the most effective than any other solution. At the end, we introduced the newly discovered BiS2-based superconducting family. The BiS2 layer is likely to play an important role of the superconductivity, as CuO2 plane of cuprates and FeAn (FeAs, FeP, FeSe or FeTe) layers of Fe-based superconductors. We will be able to create new BiS2-based superconductors with various blocking layers. We believe that unidentified exotic chalcogenide superconductors other than the families introduced here exist and are waiting to be discovered in near future.",section_header,4.

Similar to LaFeAsO1-xFx, electrons in LaO1-xFxBiS2 are doped from the LaO(F) redox layer to the superconducting BiS2 layers. The p-orbital states of Bi-S1 layers play an important role in the electron transformation due to their domination of the DOS at the Fermi level. From the phonon calculations for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we obtain a strong electron-phonon coupling of λ = 0.8 and a superconducting transition temperature of Tc = 9.1 K, the latter being very close to its experimental value. It then follows that LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a conventional electron-phonon superconductor. For LaO1-xFxBiS2, we have shown that the electronic states near the Fermi level are dominantly from the hybridized p orbital states of the Bi and S1 atoms, and the electron-phonon coupling comes mainly from the contribution of the Bi and S phonons. These facts indicate that the BiS2 layers play an important role in the transport and superconducting properties, similar to the CuO2 layers of the cuprates or Fe-As layers of the Fe-based superconductors.

Our results also suggest that thin films of BiS2 on various substrates may exhibit unusual properties due to epitaxial strain at the interface. New materials with similar structures but with BiO2 plane could be quite interesting due to smaller mass of oxygen atom, which gives higher phonon energies, and in turn higher Tc. In fact, the results reported here remind us of another interesting system, namely Ba1-xKxBiO3[25], which exhibits several complicated structural phases[26] and superconductivity at 31 K[25]. It is too early to say which of these predictions from DFT calculations will be demonstrated experimentally. However it is clear that the BiS2 based layered systems are very rich in physics, involving nearly ferroelectric soft phonons and CDW ordering along with strongly coupled electron-phonon superconductivity.

Methods The first-principles calculations were performed within the plane-wave implementation of the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation to density functional theory as implemented in the PWSCF package[21]. We used Vanderbilt-type ultrasoft potentials. The wavefunction and charge cutoffs are taken as 40 Ry and 480 Ry, respectively. We tested that k-sampling converges well with a k-point grid of 20x20x6 in the tetragonal cell. For √ 2 × √ 2 structure, we used k-mesh of 14x14x6. The structures are optimized until the forces on atoms are less than 0.005 eV/˚A and the stress is less than 0.01 kbar. Some of the total energy and phonon calculations were also repeated by Vienna Ab-Initio Simulation Package using more accurate Projector Augmented Waves method[22]. We obtained very similar results concerning the structural distortion, soft phonons and their energies. Finally, the electric polarization is calculated by PWSCF via the modern theory of polarization (i. e. Berry Phase). We used 20x20x6 k-mesh for self-consistent calculations and the polarization is calculated using twice dense k-grid along the calculated p",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",15398.0,,4963.0,4963.0,773.0

According to our data, the main factors at fluorine doping are: (i) the increase of the charge transfer between adjacent blocks [LnO]→[BiS2] related to metallization of superconducting blocks [BiS2]; (ii) the dome-shaped dependence of Ntot(EF) on x related to the regulation of the values of TC, and (iii) the reconstruction of the 2D-like Fermi surface, which is related to the nesting effect. _________________________ 1.

Summarizing, a weak-coupling RPA analysis of a minimal 2-orbital model was used to investigate the pairing properties of the BiS2-based superconductors. Fillings between 0.46 and 1.0 were analyzed. The Hund's coupling was varied in the range 0.1 ≤J/U ≤0.4. Qualitatively, the results are similar for all values of J/U and different fillings. In the RPA results described here, a clear relationship is found between quasi FS nesting, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity: the topology of the two hole-pockets is such that they present almost parallel segments close to the (π/2, π/2) wavevector in the BZ. It is found that the horizontal distance (kn, 0) between the tangents to these segments at the points where they cross the Σ line is also where the noninteracting susceptibility χ0 has a pronounced peak at (kn, 0), for 0.46 ≤n ≤1.0. Once interactions are introduced, this peak will diverge at a certain critical coupling U for each filling, and all the values of J/U studied (with exception of one: n = 0.5, J/U = 0.1). In addition, a line of local maxima, connecting the BZ points (kn, 0) and (0, kn), is clearly observed in a 2-d plot of χ0. As expected, this line can also be associated to FS nesting. This nesting structure gives origin to pairing functions with similar eigenvalues, i. e., similar pairing strengths, and symmetries B2g and A1g. This close competition originates in the FS quasi nesting properties, which determine the spin-fluctuation-mediated inter-pocket pair scattering. This pair scattering is overwhelmingly between two adjacent FS segments, therefore the properties of the pairing functions, including the pairing strength, are quite ""local"", having almost no dependence on their global symmetry. One can then predict that pairing symmetry measurements may contain a mixture of both symmetries if the pairing mechanism is driven by spin fluctuations.

The parent compound shows semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing temperature. Via electron doping, we discovered a new BiS2based superconductor Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with a Tc as high as 2.8 K. Importantly, this superconductivity was found to develop on the background of insulating normal state, raising a question of whether this superconductor is in proximity to a Mott insulator or a band insulator. Based on the heat capacity measurement, we speculate that the superconducting electron pairs might have a strongcoupled nature. In this regard, it would certainly be interesting to identify the symmetry of superconducting order parameter in this system along with other BiS2based superconductors.

A weak insulating behavior is induced in the normal state when a high magnetic field is applied. This can be induced either by an adjacent competing order, or the very shallow px and py band and small Fermi energy. A kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity at all high magnetic fields when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed. This kink can be regarded as the presence of local pairing, or the upper critical field Hc2(T). The SC fluctuation region from the STS measurement extends to about 14 K although the bulk superconducting transition temperature is only about 3.7 K. The gapped feature near the Fermi energy can also extend to a high magnetic field ( 5 T), which is consistent with the resistive measurements, again indicating a strong superconducting fluctuation. From the tunnelling spectra, a mean superconducting gap of 3 meV is widely observed, which leads to a very high ratio of 2∆/kBTc ≈16.6, suggesting strong coupling superconductivity.

The crystal structure establishes the increase in the c-axis for superconducting sample to that of the parent Bi6O8S5 that relates to the bending of Bi2-S2-Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer.

Also, we have investigated the variation of Tc at different applied pressures using four probe techniques. The Tc onset decreases gradually from 4.8 K to 4.3 K in Bi4O4S3 for all the applied pressures (0 to 1.4 GPa) and therefore it holds a negative pressure coefficient of -0.287 K/GPa. Contrarily, the pressure effect on Tc of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 has positive pressure coefficient where the Tc onset increases up to 1.31 GPa at a rate of 0.435 K/GPa and thereafter it reduces for further enhancement of pressure becomes negative coefficient (dTc onset/dP= -0.1714 K/GPa K/GPa) on Tc at high pressure of 1.75 GPa. The present results of hydrostatic pressure studies on electrical resistivity of these two BiS2 based superconductors from  vs T studies suggest that the change of Tc and superconducting state under pressure obtained for both compounds are to quite different from each other.

True,,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_text_dumps/1307.4157v5_full.txt,1307.4157v5_full.txt,"We have observed a striking enhancement of superconductivity accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behavior with pressure in the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds (Ln = La, Ce) at critical pressures of ∼1.1 GPa and ∼2.0 GPa for Ln = La and Ce, respectively. There is markedly similar behavior in the electrical resistivity measurements under applied pressure for these two BiS2-based superconductors LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that for both compounds, the suppression of their semiconducting behavior is hysteretic upon application of pressure. The semiconducting behavior of the electrical resistivity is consistent with two energy gaps that are suppressed with pressure in a similar way. The pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits hysteresis below a critical pressure where there is a change in slope of log(ρ) vs. P and where the maximum value of Tc is observed. Furthermore, for both compounds, we have discovered a continuous and reversible transient region between regions of low and high Tc, which is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition; however, the mechanism behind the broadening of the superconducting transitions between the lower and higher Tc regions is unclear. The broadening could be a simple consequence of the sensitive pressure-dependence of Tc in this region, which, when coupled with even a modest pressure gradient, could result in broader measured superconducting transitions. Sample inhomogeneity might also be responsible for the distribution of transition pressures seen in the broadening region, and the possibility of pressure-induced structural phase transitions is currently being investigated with x-ray diffraction measurements under pressure. Given the striking similarity in behavior for these two BiS2-based superconductors, further electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on other compounds could point to characteristic behavior of BiS2-based superconductors in general. In experiments currently underway we have observed the same qualitative behavior for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds as were observed in the the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds suggesting this is indeed a general phenomenon in the class of LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. Our results on the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound may be compared to the recently reported study of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 specimens prepared in a solid state reaction by Selvan et al.16 For the compounds with Ln = La, Ce and Pr, there is a dramatic decrease in the electrical resistivity with pressure that reflects a continuous suppression of semiconducting behavior. Although the temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity, dρ/dT, at the highest pressures is small for these Ln = La, Ce and Pr compounds, the coefficient nevertheless remains negative (dρ/dT < 0), so that we cannot definitely conclude that the metallic state has been achieved. We have, however, been able to reach a metallic state for Ln = Nd, indicated by a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (dρ/dT > 0), consistent with a semiconductor-metal transition. Experiments to pressures in excess of 3 GPa are currently under way to see if definitive metallic states (i. e., dρ/dT > 0) can be attained for the Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds.

In the four compounds, the pressure-induced transition observed in the superconducting state is coincident with changes in the suppression of the electrical resistivity ρ in the normal state. The rate of suppression of semiconducting behaviour (Figure 3(a)) and the rate of decrease in the energy gap ∆1 (Figure 3(b)) both saturate at pressures that correlate with the transition pressure into the high Tc superconducting phase. In the specific case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, a semiconductor-metal transition occurs at Pt. These changes in the normal state electrical resistivity indicate there may be significant increases in the charge carrier density during the rapid increase in Tc that occurs between the two superconducting phases.[17] The transition pressures Pt, indicated by the black arrows in the temperaturepressure phase diagrams of Figure 4(a), were defined as the pressure corresponding to the value of Tc at the midpoint between the values of Tc in the low and high Tc phases immediately preceding and following the transition. Pt is plotted as a function of lanthanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 in Figure 4(b). There is a clear linear relationship between the increasing atomic number of Ln and an increase in Pt. The magnitude of the ""jump"" in Tc also scales with the atomic number of the Ln element in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 as clearly shown in the inset of Figure 4(b). The pressureinduced increase in Tc decreases in magnitude as the atomic number of the lanthanide element increases. The lengths of the vertical bars in Figure 4(b) represent the respective pressure windows over which the transitions from the low Tc phase to the high Tc phase occurred in each of the four compounds. The pressure range over which the transition occurs also decreases with increasing atomic number of Ln in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2. Table 1 contains values of low Tc, maximum Tc, overall increase in Tc (max. Tc - low Tc), and transition pressure Pt, for each compound. The evolution of Tc with pressure in the low Tc phase has recently been reported for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) compounds in two studies by Selvan et al.[15, 16] Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, they observed a gradual increase of Tc from 3.7 to 4.7 K with pressure up to ∼2.2 GPa.[16] For NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, they found a gradual evolution of Tc with pressure from 4.6 to 5.0 K up to a pressure of ∼1.3 GPa and then down from 5.0 to 4.8 K upon further application of pressure up to ∼1.8 GPa.[15] In both reports, however, there was no evidence of a transition characterized by a rapid increase in Tc. It is possible that slight variations in the chemical composition of the samples in their studies compared to those studied by us may be responsible for differences in the material's response to applied pressure. Furthermore, the pressure transmitting media used in this study (see section 2) and the transmitting fluid used in their studies [15, 16] may have different properties with regard to pressure gradients that can affect the measured pressure at which a transition occurs.[19] It is also possible that the pressures reached in their studies were lower than the pressure required to induce the transitions that we observed in this report. 5. Concluding remarks We have observed markedly similar behaviour in the temperature dependence of the normal state electrical resistivity and evolution of the superconducting critical temperature Tc under applied pressure for the two BiS2-based superconductors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd). The qualitative behaviour observed for the two compounds in this study is strikingly similar to the results we recently reported for the two BiS2-based superconductors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce).[14] In each of the four compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), there is a sizable enhancement of Tc in the superconducting state accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behaviour with pressure in the normal state. The suppression of the semiconducting behaviour in the normal state saturates at a critical pressure Pt which corresponds to the pressure where there is a transition between a low Tc superconducting phase and a high Tc superconducting phase. The semiconducting behaviour of the electrical resistivity in the normal state is consistent with an energy gap that is suppressed with pressure in a similar way. In the particular case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, there is a pressure-induced semiconductor-metal transition at Pt ≈2 GPa. The coincidence of the saturation of the suppression of semiconducting behaviour in the normal state electrical resistivity with the rapid increase in Tc indicates there may be significant increases in the charge carrier density in the vicinity of the pressureinduced transition. We found that the transition pressure Pt (see section 4) increases with increasing atomic number of the lanthanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2. However, the size of the increase in Tc between the two superconducting phases decreases as lanthanide atomic number increases. The scaling of both the transition pressure Pt and the size of the ""jump"" in Tc with the atomic number of the lanthanide element suggests that the pressure-induced transition between the two superconducting phases may be a structural transition; however, at present, the precise Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors mechanism driving the enhancement of Tc with pressure is unknown. X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound are currently underway to help determine whether the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc and the suppression of semiconducting behaviour are related to a structural transition.

Temperature dependence of the upper critical fields and also the absolute value, Hc2(0) = 15.3(4) kOe were determined from the resistivity measurements. The Hc2(T ) data shows a positive curvature close to Tc, which is a sign of multi-gap superconductivity in Bi4O4S3. ZFµSR data show no sign of magnetic anomaly in the superconducting ground state of Bi4O4S3. The temperature dependence of λ-2 is compatible with a twogap s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values, ∆1(0) = 0.93(3), ∆2(0) = 0.09(4) meV and penetration depth, λ(0) = 861(17) nm. The presence of two superconducting gaps in Bi4O4S3 is predicted by theoretical works such as first principles band structure calculations suggesting two band crossing the Fermi surface and the RPA analysis of a two-orbital model for the BiS2based superconductors [10, 11]. Hall, Seebeck coefficients and magnetoresistance measurements also further support our experimental finding [13, 15]. It is worth mentioning that even though our data are more compatible with a two-gap model, a single-gap model can not be ruled out completely. Our results show that Bi4O4S3 is a bulk superconductor with a fully developed node-less superconducting energy gap and extremely low superfluid density compared to other layered superconductors.

In order to further unravel the superconductivity in the sample, we have measured the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on the single crystals. The measurements were done with a commercial instrument Unisoku-11T with ultra-high vacuum system. The single crystals were cleaved under an ultra-high vacuum then followed by the measurements at a low temperature down to 0.4 K. The details of the measurements and results are given in Methods. One typical set of data measured at temperatures from 0.4 to 26 K is shown in Fig.5a. One can see that, the data measured at low temperatures exhibit clearly two sets of energy gaps, one small gap 3.0 5.3 ± ≈ ∆s meV and a larger gap 5.7 ± ≈ ∆s meV. The small gap is marked by the dashed red line in Fig.5b. Interestingly, at the bias voltage of the small gap, two coherence peaks appear at about 3.5 meV and gradually disappear at about 6 K. Therefore we can conclude that this small gap seems corresponding to the bulk superconducting transition at around 5 K. This feature can be easily observed in the STS with the data normalized by that at 8 K and shown in Fig.5c. As shown in Fig.5b, the larger gap, however, shows up as the energy features at about 7.5±1 meV at low temperatures, and as a suppression to the deferential conductance (dI/dV) or the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) at temperatures above 8 K. This feature can extend to high temperatures and gradually vanishes at about 26 K. One can naturally connect this larger gap to the giant superconducting fluctuations in the resistive measurements. In the resistive data shown in Fig.2a, one can see that the normal state reveals a semiconducting behavior when superconductivity is completely suppressed. Similar phenomenon was observed and emphasized in the polycrystalline CeO1-xFxBiS2 samples previously5,6. This is anti-intuitive to the BCS picture, since a metallic state should be recovered in the normal state. One may argue that this semiconducting behavior is induced by the localization effect of electrons in the low dimensional system as derived from the band structure calculations22,23. This scheme is however also not workable here. For a low dimensional system, impurities may induce a semiconducting behavior due to the localization effect, the magnetic field will weaken this localization effect and the semiconducting feature. While our observation is that, when the superconductivity is suppressed, the semiconducting feature above Tc shows up. In addition, the magnetic field seems enhancing this semiconducting effect in a certain field region. Another possibility is the possible Kondo-like scattering which will induce a semiconducting behavior. This explanation can also be excluded because we don't have this type of strong magnetic impurities in the samples. In addition, the weakening effect of the semiconducting behavior by the magnetic field in a Kondo system is not observed here. For this low dimensional system, there is however a tendency for the charge-density-wave (CDW). When the superconductivity is suppressed, the CDW tendency will be promoted and lead to a semiconducting feature. While the interesting point is that, the ""normal state"" here above Tc ≈ 4.83 K at zero field seems not showing even a weak or negligible semiconducting effect. If it were induced by the CDW tendency, it would show out above Tc even the field is zero. Therefore this semiconducting feature of the normal state under a magnetic field is non-trivial and requires further input. From the STS measurements we observed two gap features at different energies. The smaller gap 2.0 5.3 ± ≈ ∆s meV is corresponding to the bulk superconducting transition at about 5 K. Taking Tc = 4.83 K, the ratio c B s T k / 1∆ = 16.8! This is much larger than the theoretical value 3.5 in the weak coupling limit of the BCS model. If we use the upper boundary of the superconducting fluctuation temperature, for example 20 K as the pairing temperature, we have c B s T k / 1∆ =4.06, which is not far from the BCS value 3.5. This probably suggests that the superconducting pairing occurs at a high temperature (for example 20 K). Because of the very low dimensionality, the superconducting fluctuation is very strong, and the bulk transition at about 5 K is actually corresponding to the phase coherence temperature. This gives strong resemblance to the case in cuprate superconductors. Following this line, the gap feature at 5.7 ± ≈ ∆s meV may be a pseudogap, which may be induced by the tendency of the CDW order, or by the local pairing governed by the valence fluctuation effect of the Bi2+ and Bi3+ ionic states24. If the latter mechanism is proved, this interesting BiS2-based superconductor will provide us a new platform for th",section_header,conclusion,10034.0,,4898.0,4898.0,813.0

Through the measurements of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility, the parent compound was found to be semiconducting-like with an thermal activation energy Eg ∼38 meV. Via the partial La doping on Sr sites, however, the resistivity decreases sharply, and ultimately superconductivity emerges as x > 0.3 and it reaches Tc of 3.5 K at the optimal level of x = 0.55. The superconducting samples undergo a metal to semiconductor transition/crossover below Tmin, which is seen to be gradually suppressed with further doping whilst Tc remains nearly unchanged above the optimal doping. Hall effect measurements for the La-doped samples confirm that the sign change of RH from positive to negative may be ascribed to the suddenly topology change of the Fermi Surface. A drop in RH and the non-linear transverse resistivity ρxy with field are associated with the multi-band effect or a CDW instability. According to these measurements, an electronic phase diagram is thus established. Acknowledgments Y. K.

Namely, we assume that the increase in Tc cannot be explained by an increase in the number electron carriers. Having considered these facts, we conclude that the increase in Tc correlates with the uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2.",inline_phrase,"In summary,",8041.0,8844.0,792.0,792.0,110.0

The anomalous temperature dependence of the low-energy spectrum indicates that the superconducting pairing develops in a highly interacting electronic state.

The estimated transition temperatures were Tconset = 11.1 and Tczero = 8.5 K in the electrical resistivity measurements and Tconset = 11.5 and Tcirr = 9.4 K in the magnetic susceptibility measurements. These values are higher than those of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples obtained from a conventional solid-state reaction. It was found that the high-Tc phase can be stabilized under high pressure and relatively-low heating temperature. XRD experiments indicated that to realize the high-Tc phase in BiS2-based superconductor, the smallest value of the c/a ratio of the lattice constants is essential. Since the superconducting properties of the HP-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample is better than those of the solid-state-reacted samples and the HP-post-annealed samples, detailed investigations of superconducting properties using the HP sample will provide us with important information for elucidating the mechanisms of BiS2-based superconductivity.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",11619.0,12870.0,1218.0,1218.0,170.0

The temperature dependence of upper critical field shows anomalous behavior with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We found that the anisotropy of upper critical field of the polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be estimated by analyzing the characteristic temperatures in the d/dT-T curve. It was found that there were three kinds of upper critical field in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field 0HC2 min is regarded as the 0Hc2 when the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the c axis of the grain. The 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid are regarded as the 0Hc2 where the superconducting states are suppressed for the grains with an orientation of H // ab. The difference between the 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S plane, which is possibly caused by the lattice distortion or strain within the Bi-S plane. Hence, the upper critical fields 0HC2 a-axis and 0HC2 b-axis are different due to the difference of effective mass. The fraction of the grains in superconducting states decreases with increasing magnetic field in the order of 0 T, 0HC2 min, 0HC2 mid and 0HC2 max. Above 0HC2 max, all the grains become non-superconducting. The estimated d0HC2 max/dT, d0HC2 mid/dT and d0HC2 min/dT are -7.05 (T/K), -2.60 (T/K) and -0.95 (T/K), respectively. The anisotropy parameter for upper critical field estimated using d0HC2 max/dT and d0HC2 min/dT is 7.4, which is clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over 30 in the previous report for LaO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals (Tc ~ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and the lower anisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Moreover, the evolution of the in-plane anisotropy within the Bi-S plane may play an important role for the enhancement of Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.",section_header,4.

The annealed crystals show a typical metallic behavior with a superconducting transition temperature near 4 K. We performed a combined optical spectroscopy and first principle band structural calculation study on Nd(O, F)BiS2 single crystal. The optical measurement reveals a simple metallic behavior with a relatively small plasma frequency of 2.1 eV. Taking the doping level of 7% of itinerant electrons per Bi site as determined by ARPES experiment on the same batch of crystals, the band structure calculations not only well reproduce the spectral weight of the low frequency Drude component but also the energy scales of the interband transitions. Those results indicate essentially the absence of correlation effect in the compound. The study also illustrates that the doping level of superconducting compound is far from the CDW instability suggested in early studies for a doping level of x=0.5.

Although our sample does not show zero resistivity at ambient pressure, by applying pressure up to 2.44 GPa, maximum Tc onset and Tc zero were observed at 6.7 K and 5 K. The resistivity of both low- and high-Tc phases shows metallic behavior. This is very different from what was seen in the BiS2 system. The γ extremely decreases from 20 to 9.3 after the phase transition, and the resistivity of the normal conducting state in high-Tc phase gradually increases with increasing applied pressure which is in accordance with the BiS2 system. In this current stage, the optimal Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was not observed even at the maximum pressure obtained during this study. Therefore applied further pressure has the potential to induce a much higher Tc in this system.

In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 samples, bulk superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.5 with y = 0.5 and x = 1.0 with y = 0.3. The Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity. The Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 commonly increases with increasing Nd concentration. The highest Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the systematic substitution of Ce by Nd generates chemical pressure along the a axis while c axis does not show a remarkable change on Nd concentration. The lattice constants of c get shorter with increasing F concentration. This result indicates the partial substitution of O by F generates lattice contraction along c axis. Furthermore, we found that Nd can be replaced by smaller Sm ions, up to z = 0.8. Bulk superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 with y = 0.3 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 with y = 0.5. The Tc onset in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 increased with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 5.6 K for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. The Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity within a range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.4. With increasing Sm concentration, the lattice constant of a decreases while the lattice constant of c does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm concentration. The lattice constant of a in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is shorter than that of the shortest value of the lattice constant of a in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. This indicates that the effect of chemical pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is clearly larger than that in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. We established a three kinds of phase diagram for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). On the basis of the phase diagrams, both lattice contraction of a axis and optimal F concentration are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity in REO1-yFyBiS2. Furthermore, the c/a ratio of the higher Tc samples is concentrated at near c/a = 3.39. Within this region, the chemical pressure along the a axis is the strongest in the studied samples. Therefore, both uniaxial contraction along the a axis generated by chemical pressure and optimal F concentration are important for the inducement of bulk superconductivity with a higher Tc in the REO1-yFyBiS2 superconductors.",section_header,6.

Structural distortion in the Bi-S plane was analyzed. We find that the Bi-S bond lengths decrease with the increase in the doping level of the smaller Sm ion at the La site. We have observed superconductivity in La1-y SmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 - 0.8) and we find that Tc is gradually enhanced upon doping Sm at the La site as y→ 0.8. Absence of superconductivity in SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is anomalous and deserves to be investigated. We also think that a tuning between these parameters via suitable doping or applied pressure could lead to superconductivity in SmO1-xFxBiS2.

The crystal structure, featured with the existence of two crystallographically distinct europium sites, was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffractions. We investigated the Eu valence state by: (1) structural probing with calculation of Eu-BVS; (2) internal and local probing with 151Eu Mössbauer spectroscopy; and (3) bulk probing with analysis of magnetic properties. The results of these three probes consistently point to an anomalous Eu valence state in which the Eu(1)-site cations are essentially divalent, whilst the Eu(2)-site cations are in a mixed valence state with a valence of ∼+2.6(1). The mixed valence allows charge transfer, which realizes electron doping into the conduction bands that are mainly composed of Bi- 6px and 6py orbitals. That is why we observed metallic conduction and superconductivity in the undoped Eu3Bi2S4F4.

To obtain a general tendency in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors, we added data points for Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 [analyzed in this study], NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [38], PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 [16], SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [18], and LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 (y = 1) single crystal [39]. Interestingly, data points for all the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type are located on a single slope highlighted by a blue region. Notably, the data points for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 and SmO0.5F0.5BiS2, which do not exhibit superconductivity, locate on the left region of the boundary suggested in Fig. 4 (in-plane chemical pressure < 1.011). These facts suggest that the emergence of superconductivity and Tc of REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type simply depend on degree of in-plane chemical pressure. If we consider the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory with electron-phonon mechanisms [40], the enhancement of Tc would be explained by an increase of phonon frequency and/or an enhancement of density of state at the Fermi level. Generally in metals, an increase in overlap of orbitals should decrease density of state due to an increase of band width. Therefore, an increase in density of state could not simply explain the enhancement of Tc in this series. Although phonon frequency might be enhanced with increasing in-plane chemical pressure, further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the enhancement of Tc with increasing in-plane chemical pressure. Notably, Tc for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 and LaOBiSe2, indicated with a red region, are clearly located on a lower side of that for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type series. As an important fact, evolutions of Tc in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 do not correspond and exhibit different curves. For the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 compounds, in-plane chemical pressure is relatively stronger than that in REO0.5F0.5BiS2, but their Tc is clearly lower than those of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As described above, Se preferably occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Therefore, it can be considered that superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is induced in a Bi-(S, Se) or a Bi-Se plane. If we assume the BCS theory, the lower Tc in Bi-Se plane can be explained by a lower phonon frequency in Bi-Se plane than that in Bi-S plane due to the larger atomic number of Se. In order to confirm the assumption above and mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based family, we need to obtain other REO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductors like CeO0.5F0.5BiSe2 or NdO0.5F0.5BiSe2 and add data points on an extension of the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 series. As a conclusion with Fig. 4, we expect that a higher Tc would be obtained with Bi-S plane with a higher in-plane chemical pressure in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2-type compounds. At the end, we briefly discuss about the HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 which shows the highest Tc among BiCh2-based superconductors [13,28-32]. T. Tomita et al. reported that the crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 above 0.7 GPa was monoclinic [31]. In the monoclinic structure, the Bi-S1 plane is distorted into a zigzag chain with a shorter Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å; zigzag chains are connected with a longer Bi-S1 distance of 3.03 Å to each other. In fact, we reported in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field within the Bi-S1 plane in a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, implying the emergence of quasi-one-dimensional superconducting states within the distorted Bi-S1 plane of a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [41]. If we simply calculate the value of chemical pressure using a Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å with the equation (1), we obtain chemical pressure of 1.06. (In this case, obtained chemical pressure is not in-plane chemical pressure but quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure.) Chemical pressure of 1.06 and Tc of 10 K give a data point locating on a rough extension of the Tc-chemical pressure curve for the other REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors discussed in Fig. 4. This might indicate that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure, not in-plane chemical pressure, would be essential for the evolution of superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds. To further discuss and understand the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in the BiCh2 family, investigations of crystal structure and superconducting properties for new BiS2-, BiSe2-based and/or BiTe2-based compounds with various spacer layers are needed. In summary, we have analyzed crystal structure of optimally-doped BiCh2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using powder synchrotron XRD to reveal relationship between crystal structure and superconducting properties in BiCh2-based layered compounds. We have found that the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure could commonly induce bulk superconductivity in both systems. Furthermore, we revealed that Tc for the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors could be determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure and a kind of Ch element composing superconducting Bi-Ch planes. In addition, on the basis of discussion on the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds and a monoclinic phase (high pressure phase) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we suggest a possibility that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure within a Bi-Ch chain, not in-plane (two-dimensional) chemical pressure, would be essential for a higher Tc in BiCh2-based superconductors. Methods Polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 used in this study were prepared using solid state reaction. The detailed synthesis procedures were described in previous reports [33,34]. Powder synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed at room temperature at the BL02B2 experimental station of SPring-8 (JASRI; Proposal No. 2014B1003 and 2014B1071). The wavelength of the radiation beam was 0.49542(4) Å. We have performed the Rietveld refinement (RIETAN-FP [42]) for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using a typical structure model of REOBiCh2-based superconductor with a tetragonal space group of P4/nmm [36,37]. Contributions from impurity phases of rare-earth fluorides (REF3) and/or Bi2S3 are included in Rietveld refinement. In addition, we have analyzed a crystal structure for two related compounds of Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 to enrich the discussion part [33]. The obtained crystal structure parameters are summarized in Table S1. The schematic images of crystal structure were drawn using VESTA [43].",section_header,Discussion,17883.0,24792.0,6766.0,6766.0,960.0

The possible charge density wave occurring at 280 K in undoped material is suppressed upon electron doping and a semiconducting behavior is observed before the onset of superconductivity at 2.2 K. Application of external pressure further increases the Tc upto an impressive value of 10 K. This is the first report of significant enhancement of Tc by electron doping and high pressure in EuBiS2F.

The values of a-axis lengths are measured at room temperature and ambient pressure. Tcs are determined by the onset of diamagnetic transition or zero resistivity. In the doped samples, the Tc and a-axis length values are those of the optimally-doped ones. (Sr, La)FBiS2 has the longest a-axis among these compounds. In RE(O, F)BiS2, a-axis shrinks and Tc increases with increasing atomic number of RE from La to Nd. The a-axis lengths of Bi2(O, F)S2 and Bi4O4S3 / Bi3O2S3, whose blocking layers contain fluorite-type BiO layers, are shorter than that of Nd(O, F)BiS2, although ionic radius (coordination number 6)27) of Bi is between Nd and Pr. Tcs of BiS2-based superconductors under ambient pressure show a dome-like tendency with the top of Tc ~5.5 K at a ~3.98 Å in (Nd0.2Sm0.8)(O0.7F0.3)BiS2 28). When a-axis in longer than ~4.0 Å, significant increase of Tc is observed in HP resistivity measurement. In contrast, compounds with shorter a-axis lengths, Bi2(O, F)S2 and Bi4O4S3, show rapid decrease of Tc in HP resistivity measurement. The relation between lattice parameter and Tc for as-synthesized and HP annealed Bi2(O, F)S2 is summarized in Fig. 6. In the optimally-doped samples with a- and c-axes longer than ~3.97 Å and shorter than ~13.73 Å, the value of Tc is maintained at ~5.1 K. In the underdoped samples, a-axis is shorter than ~3.97 Å and c-axis is longer than ~13.73 Å, and Tc increases as a- and c-axis expands and shrinks by HP anenaling. Tcs for undoped Bi2OS2 sintered under high pressures are also in this trend. It should be emphasized that in HP annealed / synthesized undoped Bi2OS2, superconductivity is achieved without intentional carrier doping. In Bi2OS2, the Bi-S planes are not very flat, the in-plane S-Bi-S angle being 159.8°25). The expansion of a-axis may lead to flatter Bi-S plane. In LaOBiS2, F-doping not only increases the carrier concentration but also flattens the buckling of the Bi-S plane and this structural transformation is also related to the appearance of superconductivity29). Similar phenomena would happen in the undoped and underdoped Bi2(O, F)S2 by HP annealing, which resulted in the increases of Tcs in these samples. The decrease of Tc in HP resistivity measurement might be explained by the tendency shown in Fig. 6(a). In HP resistivity measurement, a-axis might shrink by applying high pressures at low temperatures, and superconductivity could be disappeared. Structural analysis on Bi2(O, F)S2 under high pressures at low temperatures would provide fruitful information to clear this point. 5. Conclusion High pressure (HP) resistivity measurement and HP annealing were performed for a BiS2-based superconductor Bi2(O, F)S2, which caused different variation of Tc. In HP resistivity measurement, Tc linearly decreased at the rate of -1.2 K GPa-1. In contrast, by HP annealing at 2 GPa and 470°C, Tc increased in undoped and underdoped samples, and maintained at 5.1 K in optimally-doped sample. In HP resistivity measurement high pressure is applied in-situ at low temperatures, while HP annealing quenches the high pressure and high temperature phase to ambient pressure. Although in both cases hydrostatic high pressure is applied to the sample by a cubic-anvil-type apparatus, the difference between the two methods should be considered carefully. HP annealing technique have been mainly developed on BiS2-based superconductors, but this method can cause unique effects on physical properties of various layered compounds.",section_header,4.

Motivated by recent experiments in superconducting members of the BiS2 family of compounds showing its 'hidden' 1d electronic structure and the strong effect that pressure has over its superconducting state, we propose an effective 1d model where the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian is obtained through DFT calculations for the 2d model for BiS2. Supported by the DOS results shown in Fig. 2, we add the Sulfur p- and s-orbital to the p-orbital of Bismuth. Despite being several eV below the other two orbitals, the s-orbital undergoes strong hybridization with the Bismuth p-orbital and has a sizable contribution to the DOS at the Fermi energy, justifying its inclusion in the model (see Figs. 1 and 2). Pair scattering terms are then added and treated at the mean-field level. We solve the gap equations and systematically probe what combination of pair-scattering terms produce results in qualitative agreement with the experiments, i. e., approximate location of the superconducting phase in a T vs. doping phase diagram, realistic coupling constant values, and dependence with hopping parameters (simulating application of hydrostatic pressure). We find that single-gap SC does not produce acceptable results. This is quite relevant, as there is experimental evidence that BiS2 presents two gaps27. We find that if we consider s- and pb-type pairs, and allow for intra and interband scattering we obtain results in semi-quantitative agreement with experiments. The same is true if we choose pa- and pb-type pairs, and also allow for intra and interband scattering. The interesting point here is that the tsp hopping is the one that, in both cases, enhances SC when its magnitude in5 creases, whereas the effect on ∆of increasing tpp is marginal. This last point reinforces the need for considering the Sulfur s orbital explicitly. We argue that the anti-symmetric character of the tsp hopping (as stressed in previous work by one of the authors23) may explain its enhanced effect in the superconducting state. Acknowledgment.

An increase in the nominal F compositions in the starting materials was found to enhance the values of F concentration in the obtained single crystals. On increasing the nominal F composition, the analytical F composition also increased and reached saturation at 0.45 (R = La), 0.29 (R = Ce), 0.26 (R = Pr), and 0.42 (R = Nd) when the nominal F composition exceeded around 0.6.

Thermal conductivity shows no discernible anomaly at Tc, suggesting that both of the electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling effects are not strong. The absence of residual thermal conductivity indicates that a residual normal fluid, which is expected for nodal superconductors with impurities, is absent. The magnetic field hardly affects the thermal conductivity up to ∼0.2Hc c2, indicating the absence of Doppler shifted quasiparticles. These results provide evidence that NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 is a fully gapped superconductor. Notably, the estimated mean free path is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, indicating that the superconductivity is robust against impurity. Based on these results, we conclude a conventional s-wave superconducting state in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2. This puts a strong constraint on the theory of the superconductivity of BiS2-based layered compound, whose electronic and crystal structures bear some resemblance to Fe-based superconductors.

Our main point is that utilizing the two fold orbital degeneracy at the fermi level and unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion, doped electrons get self organized into arrays of doped Mott chains or a quantum liquid or isotropic 2d RVB staates. We have called them Wigner crystal supported RVB states. Superconductivity, within our theory, can be either isotropic 2d or anisotropic 2d Kosterlitz-Thouless state. In the isotropic (melted Wigner crystal) scenario order parameter symmetry is a gapful dxy symmetry; in the anisotropic (doped Mott Hubbard chain array) scenario we have a gapful extended-S symmetry. We made an accurate estimate of energy of the vatiational state, using known exact results from Lieb and Wu for 1d repulsive Hubbard model. Rest of the conclusions, including a possible second phase containing plaquette bond resonances logically follow from this starting point. Our work at the moment is semi quantitative and suggestive. It needs to be addressed more quantitatively. The novel scenario and a theory we have presented, that emphasizes importance of unscreened coulomb interactions in doped band insulators, is encouraging from the point of reaching higher superconducting Tc's in this s-p, non transition metal based system. We hope it will raise debates, initiate further work and be of assistance to experimentalists to engineer synthesize of new members of the family, having reduced competing orders and higher superconducting Tc.

Upon substitution, Se selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Although the Se substitution induces buckling of the Bi-Ch1 plane, its intensification results in the enhancement of the metallic conductivity and thermoelectric power factor. We explained that the enhancement of the power factor was attained owing to the increased in-plane chemical pressure. To investigate the origin of the low thermal conductivity of LaOBiSSe, we analysed the high-temperature crystal structure and atomic displacement parameters. LaOBiSSe exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion. Below 473 K, only the a-axis expands, while both a-axis and c-axis expand above 473 K. We revealed anomalously large atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for the Bi and Ch atoms in the Bi-Ch1 plane. The temperature dependences of Uiso suggest that the temperature evolutions of the atomic vibrations of the Bi-Ch1 plane in the BiCh2 layers are anomalous and similar to that of the rattling atoms in a cage structure. The anisotropic analysis of the atomic displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites suggests that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic displacement along the c-axis direction, which should presumably be the origin of the low thermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. In addition, we assume that the large Bi and Ch1 vibrations are related to the in-plane rattling, which is a new strategy for designing low- thermoelectric materials, as observed in Cu atoms of tetrahedrite compounds.",section_header,4.

The BiCh2 based superconductors are a group of layered superconductors constructed from the pyramidal BiCh2 bilayers, and blocking layers having tetragonal structure. In 1112 systems, the electrons can be doped into the BiCh plane with fluorine substitution for oxygen. The conduction bands consist of the p orbitals within the BiCh plane. The conduction bands and the Fermi surface therefore have one dimensional nature with small hoppings along the vertical directions. The irreducible susceptibility is enhanced along the (q, q,0) line due to the Fermi surface nesting and its one dimensional nature. The calculated phonon dispersion in the tetragonal lattice structure also shows the soft phonon modes along the (q, q,0) line. This indicates the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling in these materials. The first principles electronic band calculation results are overall in good agreement with the ARPES experiment, suggesting absence of strong electron correlation as in the 3d-based layered superconductors. On the other hand, there do exist some discrepancies between theory and experiment, whose origin remains to be clarified. The pairing mechanism has been studied in the context of both conventional and unconventional scenarios. Tc values comparable to the experimental observations have been obtained within the phonon-mediated pairing owing to the strong electron-phonon coupling. As for the unconventional pairing, the weak coupling spin-fluctuation calculations omitting the spin-orbit coupling predicts nodal gap functions, while a fully gapped s-wave state is obtained for the J1-J2 local spin model. In a model with spin-orbit coupling, a functional renormalization group study predicts a d*x2-y2-wave pairing, which belongs to the category of the weak topological superconductivity. In this pairing, the triplet and the singlet pairing components are mixed, and the order parameter changes its sign between the disconnected Fermi surfaces. Experimental results also suggest the possibility of charge-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. As surveyed in this review, the BiCh2 based superconductors have interesting features, such as the one dimensional nature of the electronic bands and the Fermi surface nesting, strong electron-phonon coupling, and the strong spin-orbit coupling, which may be entangled in a complex manner. The issue of the pairing mechanism and the pairing symmetry should be closely related to these features. In order to have better understanding on these issues, further theoretical as well as experimental studies are necessary.",section_header,4. Conclusion,36075.0,38822.0,2707.0,2707.0,392.0

The resistivity vanishes below 3.8 K, which together with strong diamagnetic signals in magnetization data, confirming the bulk superconductivity. In contrast to most of the BiS2based compounds where superconductivity is developed from the background of a semiconducting-like normal state, the normal state of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 exhibits a Superconductivity and abnormal pressure effect in Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 superconductor metallic behavior down to Tc. Under magnetic field or pressure, a crossover from metallic to semiconducting behaviors is induced, and the superconductivity is suppressed accordingly. While the Tc decreases with increasing monotonously, the absolute value of the normal state resistivity first decreases and then increases with pressure. All these features are in contrast to the previously known BiS2-based superconductors. While the semiconducting behavior in the normal state of most BiS2 and BiSe2 remains one of the puzzling issue in connection with the unconventional superconductivity, the opposite situation in the present compound, namely, the crossover from the metallic to semiconducting behaviors in the normal in the presence of magnetic field or pressure is rather unusual, pointing to a possible different mechanism of superconductivity in this family of materials. Such feature reminds us of a related single crystal compound Nd(O, F)BiS2[33], where the normal state exhibits the fieldinduced semiconducting behavior above Tc. This feature was attributed to the possible pseudo-gap phase extending to relatively higher temperatures as evidenced by the unusual superconducting fluctuations seen in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiment[33]. We thus expect that the superconducting mechanism of the present system may be also quite unique and deserve further investigations such as by ARPES, NMR or STS experiments in future.

Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex with x = 0˗1 were synthesized by solid state reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that Se selectively occupied at the in-plane Ch1 site, and hence, in-plane chemical pressure was enhanced. For x ≥ 0.6, superconducting transitions with a large shielding volume fraction were observed in -T measurements, and the highest Tc was 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From -T measurements, a zero-resistivity state was observed for all the samples, and the highest Tc was observed for x = 0.8. With increasing Se concentration, characteristics of -T changed from semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk superconductivity is linked with the enhanced metallicity via in-plane chemical pressure. A superconductivity phase diagram of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor was established. The -T data under high magnetic fields were analyzed with assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field, which indicated local in-plane distortion may result in the high-Tc onset, obviously higher than the bulk Tc.

First of all, the valence of Eu ions in EuBiS2F is estimated to be about +2.16(1), demonstrating the self-electron-doping nature without any extrinsic doping. Upon 50 at.% Ce-doping, the mean valence of Eu reduces to +2.05(1) and that of Ce ions are essentially trivalent. The main effect of Ce-doping is to provide additional 17% electrons into the system, beneficial for the superconductivity enhancement. The local atomic displacements can be revealed by Eu and Bi L3-edge EXAFS: 1) the in-plane Bi-S1 distance is characterized by a large configurational disorder in EuBiS2F-based system, which is quite common in BiS2-based superconductors; 2) both the shortening of the in-plane Bi-S1 bond (i. e. a higher in-plane chemical pressure) and the flatter Bi-S1 plane are responsible for an enhancement of superconductivity. In summary, we established a relationship between Ce-doping and the Tc enhancement in EuBiS2F-based superconductors, in terms of valence changes and nanoscale atomic displacements. The new findings are promising for providing insights on the interplay of charge, local structure and superconductivity. Methods Polycrystalline compounds of EuBiS2F and Eu0.5Ce0.5BiS2F were synthesized by solid-state reaction method13,15. The samples were well characterized for their phase purity, superconducting and other properties prior to the XAS measurements. The XAS spectra were collected at the BL-14W1 beamline of Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF). The storage ring was working at electron energy of 3.5 GeV, and the maximum stored current was about 250mA. The energy of the incident energy was tuned by scanning a Si (111) double crystal monochromator with energy resolution about 10-4. The XAS spectra at Ce L3-edge, Eu L3-edge, and Bi L3-edge were collected with several scans in transmission mode at room temperature. Data reduction was performed using the IFEFFIT program package34.

From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters for LaO1-xFxBiSSe and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, we revealed that the essence of in-plane chemical pressure effect was the suppression of the local in-plane disorder in the BiCh2 layers. The in-plane disorder causes the absence of metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity in typical REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Since the in-plane disorder was fully suppressed for all x in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, this system is one of the most ideal system to discuss the intrinsic nature of the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds. In LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small amount of electron doping. For LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram.

This linear relationship between lattice constants and Se content is different from that of related compounds, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. Crystal structure analysis by the Rietveld refinement showed that this is due to the indistinct site selectivity of Se substitution; namely, Se occupied both of in-plane Ch1 and out-of-plane Ch2 sites. The sample with x = 0 exhibited the semiconducting-like T and weak superconducting signals. Metallic-like conductivity and bulk superconductivity were induced by Se substitution. Such characteristics were qualitatively described in terms of increased in-plane CP, as in the case of related compounds. The highest Tc was 3.5 K for x = 0.6, and superconductivity phase diagram was established.

The structural refinements revealed that two metal sites, M1 and M2 sites, were differently surrounded by sulfur atoms. Furthermore, we found site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. The structural characteristics around the M1 and the M2 site are close to the Bi site of LaOBiS2 and the M2 site are close to the Pb site of rock-salt-type PbS, respectively. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as alternate stacks of the Pb-rich PbS-type layers and the Bi-rich LaOBiS2-type layers. From band calculations for an ideal (LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer are hybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which results in the electronic characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2. Thus, stacking the rock-salt type sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2based layered structure can largely modify the electronic structure and should be a new strategy of band engineering for designing new BiS2-based layered superconductors, thermoelectric materials, or novel functional materials.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",11648.0,12916.0,1249.0,1249.0,191.0

Although the pairing mechanisms for the superconductivity of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 cannot be completely clarified with the present isotope effect only, we briefly discuss the possibility of unconventional superconductivity. As mentioned above, unconventional mechanisms in the BiCh2-based superconductor family have been proposed by several theoretical and experimental studies [19,20,28-30]. Particularly, the ARPES experiment observed the existence of accidental nodes in nodal s-wave symmetry and proposed several possibilities of unconventional pairing mechanisms with competition or cooperation among multiple pairing interactions, such as phonon, charge, and spin fluctuations [20]. Indeed, from neutron diffraction and pair density function analysis, the importance of charge fluctuation to the superconductivity of La(O, F)BiS2 has been proposed [29]. In addition, pairing mechanisms mediated by orbital fluctuation is also possible. Since our isotope effect indicates that phonon is not essential for superconductivity, the mechanisms that are purely electronic or dominated by electronic contribution would drive the superconductivity in LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2. Our present results for the Se isotope effect on Tc of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 should be an important step to clarify the mechanisms for the superconductivity of BiCh2-based layered superconductors. In conclusion, we have investigated the isotope effect on Tc of BiCh2-based layered superconductor LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 using 76Se and 80Se isotopes. Comparing the transition temperatures investigated from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements, we have revealed that the exponent Se is close to zero. Our results suggest that the pairing in the LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 superconductor is not mediated by phonons, and unconventional superconductivity may emerge in the BiCh2 layer. To completely exclude the phonon-mediated mechanisms, we have to examine the S isotope effect for the same composition (LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2) and for a system with a pure BiS2 layer, such as Nd(O, F)BiS2 with a higher Tc of 5 K.

Note that the magnetization data from 5 to 20 K are employed because 1 shows shoulder-like anomaly at around 100 K due to crystalline-electric-field effects [48]. CurieWeiss fitting result of x = 0.1 is shown in Fig. 7 as a representative sample, and the analogous data of other samples are presented in Fig. S3. For x = 0.1, C was evaluated to be 0.011 emu/K mol, indicating Ce valence state is +3.64. As listed in Table 1, Ce valence tends to decrease with increasing x, resulting in +3.32 for x = 0.9. The decrease of Ce valence seems to be correlated with increased in-plane chemical pressure because lattice constant a decreases with x (Fig. 2(b)). In the case of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex system, the increase of in-plane chemical pressure suppress the mixed valence of Eu ions, which is demonstrated using a combined analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy [50]. It should be noted that while Ce valence tends to decreases with increasing x, the averaged RE valence (trivalent La and mixed-valent Ce) increase with x, in consistent with that obtained using BVS calculation (Table 1). It is interesting to note that an anomaly in the temperature dependence of magnetization was observed at around 8 K for x = 0.5, as depicted in Fig. S4. It has been reported that magnetic moment of Ce3+ ions of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 orders ferromagnetically, which was demonstrated using neutron scattering measurements [51]. Therefore, the magnetic anomaly for x = 0.5 at 8 K would be attributable to the ferromagnetic ordering of Ce3+ moment, as well. The valence states and magnetism of Ce in La1xCexOBiSSe are believed to be essentially sensitive to its chemical composition and/or (local) crystal structure. As an example, X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that mixed valence of Ce ions was suppressed by F doping for CeO1xFxBiS2 [44,45]. We note that the present samples are not single phase but contain CeO2 impurity phase (< 6 wt%) (Figs 1 and S1). It has been reported that CeO2 clusters may significantly contribute to the observed magnetic behavior [52]. Further investigation of local crystal/electronic structure is required to clarify the detailed relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in La1xCexOBiSSe. The highest Tc of 3.1 K in La1xCexOBiSSe is slightly lower than that of F-doped system, LaO1xFxBiSSe (Tc = 3.7 K) [14,23]. The present results suggest that substitution at different sites (substituting whether the O site or the La site) in blocking layer affect the superconducting properties of BiCh2-based superconductors. For example, it has been reported that carrier doping via partial substitution for the site spatially far from the superconducting Fe plane results in higher Tc in Fe-based superconductor BaFe2As2 [53]. It was also demonstrated that the decrease in Tc originates from magnetic pair breaking by interaction of the localized 4f orbitals in the RE dopants with the itinerant Fe 3d orbitals for the corresponding compound [54]. CONCLUDING REMARKS - In summary, we have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system La1xCexOBiSSe. Polycrystalline samples for x = 00.9 were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Crystal structure analysis showed that both lattice constants a and c decrease with increasing x.

Specific heat measurement shows that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is of bulk nature. A large specific heat jump (∆Ce/γTc = 2.31) shows strong electron-phonon coupling. 2∆(0)/kBTc obtained from the T -dependence of the electronic specific heat Ce(T ) below Tc is 4.5, and suggests strong electron- phonon coupling. The value is much smaller than that obtained from STM measurements (2∆/kBTc ∼17)[14]. T - and H-dependences of the specific heat measurements imply that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is fully gapped. These results are consistent with the s-wave symmetry proposed for the SC state of BiS2-based superconductors. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We thank S.

The temperature dependences of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient suggested that the electronic states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than those of LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3, which may be due to the formation of short M2-S1 bonds along the c-axis.

With the decrease of the RE3+ ionic radius, the lattice constant a and in-plane Bi-S1 distance monotonically decreased, which generated the in-plane chemical pressure effect. With the decrease of the RE3+ radius, the in-plane disorder of the S1 sites significantly decreased. This trend is very similar to those observed for Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Therefore, the emergence of bulk superconductivity upon the suppression of the in-plane disorder at the Ch1 sites seems to be a universal scenario for the BiCh2based superconductors. The analyses of the displacement parameters along the c-axis indicated that the amplitude of the one-dimensional vibration of S1 (or Ch1) along the c-axis was correlated with Tc in the BiCh2-based superconductors.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",13228.0,14267.0,1023.0,1023.0,150.0

In contrast to the pressure-induced low-Tc to high Tc phase transitions reported in F-containing BiS2 superconductors, the highpressure phase observed in this work does not favor superconductivity. The results suggest that fluorine plays a critical role for the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc for BiS2-based compounds. For the low-pressure phase, anomalies in the normal state resistivity, which seem to be pressure dependent, were observed in the pressure range from 0.24 to 0.45 GPa. Another unusual phenomenon observed in this study is the tendency toward more semiconducting behavior with increasing pressure in the high-pressure phase. Further studies of these unusual phenomena are expected to enrich our understanding of the physics of solids at high-pressure.

The samples with lattice parameters close to PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 (or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) and largely different mixing entropy (Smix) for the RE site were synthesized by changing the number of RE elements contained in the REO blocking layer. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements, the crystal structure parameters, including anisotropic displacement parameters, were investigated. The increase in Smix does not largely affect the bond lengths and the bond angle of the BiS2 conducting layer but clearly suppresses the in-plane disorder at the in-plane S1 site [U11 (S1)], which is the parameter essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. As expected, bulk nature of superconductivity, shielding volume fraction in the superconducting states, is enhanced by the increase in Smix. The present results clearly show that the increase in mixing entropy at the blocking layer can positively affect the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the conducting layer while these layers can be regarded as spatially-separated. The evidence of the interaction between the HE states of the blocking layer, the local structure conducting layer, and the physical properties of the material should be a novel strategy useful to design new layered materials and to enhance the functionality using the concept of high entropy alloy.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",14017.0,15622.0,1587.0,1587.0,234.0

In addition, for the BiS2-related compounds, the functional properties of thermoelectric, spin, optical, and photocatalytic materials have also been investigated in related compounds. As summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I, various types of crystal structure and compositions have been investigated. The crystal structure of the BiS2-based compounds is composed of alternately stacked BiS2 conducting (superconducting) layers and blocking (insulating) layers such as LaO or EuF. The stacking structure is similar to those of the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. A low-dimensional electronic structure is realized, and the electronic and structural properties can be easily manipulated by element substitution and/or pressure effects, which is the merit of layered systems. The parent phase of BiS2-based superconductors is an insulator with a band gap. Since the conduction band is composed of Bi 6p orbitals hybridized with S 3p, electron doping is required to obtain a metallic character. For example, electron-doped LaO1-xFxBiS2 shows superconductivity, but the superconducting states for the as-grown sample of LaO1xFxBiS2 are not bulk in nature. To induce bulk superconductivity, the optimization of the local crystal structure is important. High pressure can stabilize the monoclinic structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 and induces bulk superconductivity. In addition, the chemical pressure effect by RE substitution or Se substitution can also induce bulk superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiCh2. The in-plane chemical pressure is universally essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the BiS2-based systems. The in-plane chemical pressure suppresses the in-plane disorder of S atoms, which intrinsically exists in the BiS2-based compounds. Now, we know a method of inducing bulk superconductivity by carrier doping and structural optimization. Therefore, the next stage is the complete understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family. There are still contradictory results on the mechanisms. Further measurements on well-designed compositions with various probes and integrated discussion are required. Finally, let us mention the possibility of a higher Tc in the BiS2-based systems. As shown in Fig. 4(b), small signals with a higher Tc (higher than the bulk Tc) have been observed in some compounds. In addition, as reported by Liu et al., giant superconducting fluctuations were observed from STS. Therefore, further material development is required. We believe that a high Tc can be obtained by realizing the optimized condition (possibly extremely compressed local Bi-S bonding).

As revealed in the crystal structure part, the lattice parameters were not largely affected by the Sn substitution. Therefore, in-plane chemical pressure amplitude in the Bi-S superconducting plane, which has been revealed as the essential parameter for the emergence of superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds [24], should not be significantly changed. Therefore, we consider that the in-plane chemical pressure effect is not the origin for the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. On carrier concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases by Sn substitution for x = 0.1-0.4, which can be corresponding to the slight increase in electron carriers by Sn substitution. However, the large increase in Tc for x = 0.4 may not be understood from the increase in carrier concentration only because the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be quite small. On the basis of these facts, we briefly mention about the possible relation to the CDW ordering and the possible scenario of the suppression of CDW by Sn substitution in this system. In the -T plots, an anomaly was observed in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system. A similar feature in the normal-state resistivity has been observed in the EuFBiS2 superconductor (Tc = 0.3 K). The origin of the hump was proposed as a CDW transition [29]. We assume that the suppression of the CDW ordering is the origin for the increased Tc in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. In addition, the anomaly temperature T* was shifted to a lower temperature by Sn substitution, and the anomaly disappeared at x = 0.3. At around x = 0.3 and 0.4, Tc is the maximum. These facts imply that Tc increased by the suppression of T*. Although we have no evidence for the CDW states in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system and the suppression mechanism by the Sn substitution, introduction of randomness at the M2 site may be effective to suppress the charge ordering states. Bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 As shown in the Result part, a partial Se substitution for S induced bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. Although the solubility limit is very low (5%), the lattice parameters clearly changed by the partial Se substitution, and the superconducting properties were significantly improved. Although we refined three models with different Se site (assuming the substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites), we could not find the site selectivity of doped Se. However, we expect that the doped Se occupies the Ch1 site in the inset of Fig. 6. In previous reports on the Se substitution in BiS2-based compounds, the site selectivity of Se at the in-plane site was observed [24,32,33]. According to the relationship between in-plane disorder at the chalcogen site and superconductivity in BiS2-based systems [16,24], we assume that Se substitution reduced the inplane disorder at the S1 site and induced bulk superconductivity. Furthermore, the roomtemperature Seebeck coefficient for the La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 sample was similar to those shown in Fig. 4 (S = -25 V/K). This also suggests that the bulk nature of superconductivity was induced by local structural optimization but not due to changes in carrier concentration. Since we have reported the emergence of bulk superconductivity in La2O2M4S6-type layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3, we can expect material development in related fourlayer-type oxychalcogenide superconductors. Recently, a new superconductor Bi3O2S2Cl with the one-layer-type superconducting layer was discovered by Ruan et al. [34]. In Fig. 8, schematic images of typical one-layer-type (Fig. 8a), two-layer-type (Fig. 8b), and four-layer-type (Fig. 8c) are displayed for comparison. All the materials have the similar RE2O2 or Bi2O2 blocking layer. By changing the constituent elements in the superconducting layers, the thickness can be changed in this superconductor family. On the basis of these facts, we expect further development of materials with these crystal structures or novel materials with a superconducting layer with a different thickness (number of the superconducting layers in a unit cell). Fig. 8. Comparison of crystal structure of typical layered oxychalcogenides with different thickness of superconducting layer. a. Schematic image of the crystal structure of Bi3O2S2Cl, which was recently discovered by Ruan et al. [34]. In this material, the conducting layer can be regarded as the one-layer-type BiS2Cl. b.

Schematic image of the crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6type (La2O2M4S6-type) materials whose conducting layer can be regarded as the four-layer-type M4S6 layer. Methods The polycrystalline samples of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The polycrystalline samples of Se-substituted La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez with z = 0.3 and 0.6 were also prepared by a solid-state reaction method. Powders (or grains) of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Sn (99.99%), and AgO (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6zSez were mixed in a pestle and mortar, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated in an electric furnace. The heat treatment condition was 725 °C for 15 h for both samples. However, for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez, heating the sample to 725 °C in 1 h was needed to suppress the generation of impurity phases. The obtained samples were reground for homogeneity, pelletized, and heated in the same procedure. The phase purity of the prepared samples and the optimal annealing conditions were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation. The lattice parameters were determined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [35]. Schematic image of the crystal structure was drawn using VESTA [36]. The actual composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on scanning electron microscope TM3030 (Hitachi). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-3, Quantum Design). The susceptibility data were taken after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] was measured by four-terminal method on the Physical Property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity measurement down to 0.4 K was measured using a 3He probe platform of PPMS. The ADR system on PPMS was used for resistivity measurements down to 0.1 K. For clarity, we labeled the examined samples with the nominal compositions. The Seebeck coefficient was measured by a four-probe method on ZEM-3 (Advance RIKO) at 300 K. Author contributions R.

The associated reduction in long-range order along the direction of stacking of Bi(Se/S)2 and LaO/F layers induces formation of stacking faults. The HP SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase better preserves long-range order of the parent SCI phase compared to the S-containing one. This is evident from a more homogeneous structure of diffuse rods for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and, therefore, this system is characterized by weaker interlayer interactions which results in lower SCI-SCII transition pressure. Studied LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2 systems illustrate how structural two-dimensionality is critical for layered superconductors. Targeted enhancement of 2D-structure of layered systems either by external (pressure, temperature) or internal (chemical doping, substitutions) means should be considered as another pathway to further improve their superconducting performance.

Platelike single crystals with dimensions of 0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3 were obtained. We discovered bulk superconductivity at Tc = 4.7 K in a compound with x = 0.2. The lattice constant of the c-axis decreased with an increase in Ce content x. The shrinking of the c-axis indicated the mixed valency of Ce3+/Ce4+. It is likely that the superconductivity of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was induced by the electron doping of the mixed valence of Ce3+/Ce4+. The superconducting transition temperature of Ce-substituted Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was slightly lower than that of F-substituted NdO1-xFxBiS2. This tendency is also observed in Ce-substituted La1-xCexOBiSSe and Ce1-xPrxOBiS2. ρ(T) of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 showed a metallic behavior. In a compound with x = 0.5, a broad hump was observed in ρ(T) at approximately 80 K, similar to that found in CeOBiS2. The electrical resistivity of ρ(6 K) and ρ(280 K) increased with increasing x. The tendency of S can be understood by the increase of the Ce4+ ratio with decreasing Ce content below x = 0.5. The upper critical field µ0Hc2(T) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 was determined to be ∼12 T for H || ab and ∼0.34 T for H || c-axis. The anisotropic parameter Γ was estimated to be ∼35, which was comparable to that of F-doped NdOBiS2. The µ0Hc2(0) of the Ce-doped NdOBiS2 was approximately two times smaller than that of the F-doped one, although the difference of Γ was approximately 10. The results imply that the µ0Hc2(0) for both directions reduces in superconductivity induced by Ce-doping. Our results for Cedoped NdOBiS2 make it possible to help understand superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors.

Hence, in this study, we have investigated the effects of Se substitution on the structural, transport, and superconducting properties of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. Owing to Se doping, the normal state electrical resistivity at low temperatures was drastically suppressed, and superconductivity at a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.15 K was observed for x = 0.5. Tc increased with increasing Se concentration: Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0. According to XRD analyses, we proposed that Se was substituted for the in-plane S1 site in the BiS2 layers. Both the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall coefficient suggested that electrons were the dominant carriers. From the Hall coefficient, carrier concentration was estimated. Owing to Se substitution, the concentration of mobile carriers increased considerably; this could be related to the suppression of carrier localization caused by Se substitution. On the basis of the obtained results and the discussion based on the analogy of two-layer-type systems, the emergence of metallicity and superconductivity was explained by the in-plane chemical pressure effects. The estimated Bc2(0) was 0.76 and 1.15 T for x = 0.5 and 1.0, respectively.

The effects of external pressure on magnetization resulted in abrupt increments in Tc up to 10-10.8 K, for samples with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. Based on analyses of the shielding volume fraction estimated via magnetic susceptibility measurements, we found that two bulk superconductivity phases (low-P and high-P phases) existed for (Sr, RE)FBiS2. The common features were that the bulk low-P phase was induced by external pressure, whereas the bulk high-P phase was induced at pressures exceeding a critical pressure. Moreover, at the critical pressure, Tc sharply increased to the high-P phase as our experiment shifted to higher pressures with decreasing RE ionic radius; this implied that both the external as well as chemical pressures were affecting Tc. In addition, we investigated the variations in the crystal structure under pressure. By analysing the splitting of the (200) peak, we concluded that the high-P phase was a monoclinic structure. Various bulk superconducting phases with different space group induced via external pressure effects in (Sr, RE)FBiS2 need to be further investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based systems.

The obtained compounds were thoroughly mixed and ground, then sintered in the same conditions at the first sintering.

To investigate the crystal structure of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, XRD experiments under high pressure up to 3.4 GPa were performed at room temperature using a Mo-Kα radiation on a Rigaku (MicroMax-007HF) rotating anode generator equipped with a 100 µm collimator. Daphne 7474 was used as a pressure medium. The crystal structure parameters were refined using the Rietveld method with a RIETAN-FP software36. The actual compositions of the obtained samples were analyzed using an energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on TM-3030 (Hitachi). The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at ambient pressure and under high pressures were measured using a superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) with MPMS3 (Quantum Design). Hydrostatic pressures were generated by the MPMS high pressure Capsule Cell. The sample was immersed in a pressure transmitting medium (Daphene 7373) covered with a Teflon cell. The pressure at low temperature was calibrated from the superconducting transition temperature of Pb manometer.

From the c-axis electrical resistance (measured with a current along the c-axis), the upper critical field was determined. Also, the in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistance was investigated using a 3He probe equipped with a two-axes rotator system to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance. From the in-plane anisotropy measurements, we observed two-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states within the ab plane of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Since the crystal possessed a tetragonal square plane with a tetragonal (four-fold) in-plane symmetry, the appearance of twofold symmetry indicates the rotational symmetry breaking in the superconducting states. The phenomena are very similar to those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe with a higher electron doping concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the carrier doping concentration, which affects the Fermi surface topology, is not an essential parameter for the emergence of the nematicsuperconductivity-like phenomena in LaO1-xFxBiSSe.

Since the crystal structure of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is tetragonal, the results suggest no symmetry breaking in the in-plane anisotropy of MR in the superconducting states. This is clearly different from those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals, in which two-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR was observed in its superconducting states. We consider that the switching between twofold-symmetric and four-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR in the superconducting properties of those systems is related to the constituent elements at the superconducting planes, which is expected to modify the spin-orbit interactions. In the normal states of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, two-fold symmetric MR with a small amplitude was observed, while four-fold-symmetric anisotropy was observed in the normal states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.

Although there are some possible factors, which could affect isotope effect, other than pairing states32, we consider that the observed difference in isotope effect is essentially caused by the different pairing states between those systems. The reason for proposing the scenario is the recent observation of nematic superconductivity in La(O, F)BiSSe33,34; nematic superconductivity has been observed in unconventional superconductors like Fe-based and Bi2Se3-based superconductors35,36. Since nematic superconductivity emerges in both LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe (tetragonal) and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (tetragonal) with different carrier concentrations but with comparable structures of the BiSSe conducting layer, unconventional pairing states would commonly present in tetragonal BiCh2-based superconductors with a tetragonal symmetry without structural distortion or local disorder. In contrast, nematic superconductivity was not observed in Nd(O, F)BiS237, which is also tetragonal but has larger local structural disorder than La(O, F)BiSSe11,17,19. These facts suggest the importance of structural symmetry in the conducting layers and would support our scenario suggested in this article. Here, we discuss the possible differences in electronic states and pairing states between tetragonal and monoclinic phases. The high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2 has a monoclinic structure and a distorted in-plane structure in the BiS2 layers30. In contrast, La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3 have tetragonal structures, in which the square Bi-Ch network forms a superconducting plane. Although the low-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2 is tetragonal, same as for La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, bulk superconductivity is not observed at ambient pressure because of insufficient in-plane chemical pressure17-19,30. In the low pressure range, bulk superconductivity is induced, but the determination of Tc is difficult because there are two possible superconducting transitions of the manometer (Pb) and the high-P phase. Based on the isotope effects in the high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2, La(O, F)BiSSe, and Bi4O4S3, we suggest that structural symmetry breaking in the superconducting BiCh2 layer is an essential factor in the switching of the isotope effect from unconventional to conventional. We calculated the band structures of (Sr, La)FBiS2 and La(O, F)BiSSe (see Supplementary file). Note that the calculated results for (Sr, La)FBiS2 are based on the tetragonal structure of the low-P phase, because structural parameters for the high-P phase have not been experimentally obtained for (Sr, La)FBiS2, and the structural relaxation was not successful for the high-P phase in this work. One can determine that the shape of the Fermi surface is similar between (Sr, La)FBiS2 and La(O, F)BiSSe, because the expected carrier doping amount is comparable. Therefore, we consider that the different isotope effects were due to the modifications of electronic and/or phonon characteristics induced by structural symmetry breaking in the monoclinic phase. According to previous theoretical calculations for the tetragonal and monoclinic phases of La(O, F)BiS2, band splitting results from a structural transition from tetragonal (low-P phase) to monoclinic (high-P phase)38. In addition, the impact of interlayer coupling between two BiS2 layers, caused by the structural symmetry breaking, on the electronic states was suggested as a possibility. The switching of isotope effects between the tetragonal and monoclinic phases may be linked to the formation of the Bi-Bi bonding in the high-P phase in the present system. Let us remind that the theoretical study on the calculation of Tc for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 by Morice et al.24 was performed on a tetragonal unit cell. Their conclusion is consistent with the unconventional isotope effects observed in tetragonal La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3. If the same calculation of Tc could be performed on a monoclinic unit cell, a Tc of 10 K may be reproduced. For that, high-resolution structural analyses of the high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2 are needed. In conclusion, we synthesised (Sr, La)FBiS2 polycrystalline samples with 32S and 34S isotope chemicals. With magnetisation measurements under high pressure, we investigated the sulphur isotope effects on Tc for a high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2. As a conventional shift in Tc was observed, we suggested the importance of phonons for the pairing mechanisms for the high-P phase. Based on comparisons with isotope effects in La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, in which unconventional isotope effects have been observed, we suggest that structural symmetry breaking from tetragonal to monoclinic is a key factor for the switch of the isotope effects in the BiCh2based superconductor family. Methods Polycrystalline samples of (Sr, La)FBiS2 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method in an evacuated quartz tube. Powders of La (99.9%), SrF2 (99%), and Bi (99.999%) were mixed with powders of 32S (ISOFLEX: 99.99%) or 34S (ISOFLEX: 99.26%) with a nominal composition of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 in an Ar-filled glove box. The mixed powder was pelletised, and sintered in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 oC for 20 h, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The obtained compounds were thoroughly mixed, ground, and sintered under the same conditions as the first sintering. Except for the starting materials, the synthesis method was the same as our recent study on (Sr, La)FBiS230. The phase purity and crystal structure of the (Sr, La)FBiS2 samples were examined by laboratory X-ray diffraction (XRD) by the θ-2θ method with Cu-Kα1 radiation on a SmartLab (RIGAKU) diffractometer. The schematic images of crystal structures were drawn by VESTA39 using structural data refined by Rietveld refinement using RIETAN-FP40. Through the XRD analyses, Bi and LaF3 impurity phases were detected. The actual compositions of the examined samples were analysed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on a TM-3030 instrument (Hitachi). The average value of xEDX was calculated using the data obtained for five points on the sample surface. Standard deviation was estimated and shown in Table I. Through the XRD analyses, small spots with La-rich compositions were found. The impurity phase will be LaF3, since a LaF3 phase was found in XRD. The temperature dependence of the magnetisation at ambient pressure and under high pressures was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) on MPMS-3 (Quantum Design) after zero-field cooling (ZFC). Hydrostatic pressures were generated by the MPMS high-pressure capsule cell made of nonmagnetic Cu-Be, as described in our recent high pressure study on (Sr, RE)FBiS230. The sample was immersed in a pressure transmitting medium (Daphene 7373) and covered with a Teflon cell. The pressure at low temperature was calibrated based on the superconducting transition temperature of the Pb manometer. The magnetisation data shown in this paper contains background magnetisation. For sample #32-1, the maximum pressure was lower than that for other samples, which is due to the setup of highpressure cell with a shorter piston stroke.

By introducing a HEA-type site (or alloying multi sites) in a compound, a high mixing entropy can be achieved. HEA-type compounds would have a high mixing entropy at the alloyed site and a highly (randomly) disordered bonding states. For a three-dimensional system, such as NaCl-type chalcogenides, introduction of the HEA-type M site in MCh resulted in suppression of Tc, but, at the same time, slight enhancements of Hc2 and Jc were observed. For tetragonal (CuAl2-type) TrZr2, the introduction of the HEA-type site does not suppress Tc. Furthermore, for layered systems, such as REBa2Cu3O7-d cuprates and BiS2-based RE0.5F0.5BiS2, high-entropy alloying rather improves their superconducting properties. Through investigations of the HEA effects to superconducting and structural properties for HEA-type compounds with different structural types, we conclude that the HEA effects are highly depending on the structural dimensionality. Hence, to effectively use the HEA effect to improve superconducting properties of compounds, target structure should be lower-symmetric, a layered structure or a one-dimensional structure. To obtain further knowledge about the presence/absence of local phase separations, pinning characteristics, and the HEA effect to superconducting pairing states, further investigations on HEA-type superconducting compounds using various probes are required.",section_header,6.

But analytical F contents were similar value which was approximately 20 at% F substitution in O-site. Therefore, Sm(O, F)BiS2 with approximately 20 at% F substitution has possibility to be of intrinsic stable phase.

With increasing in-plane chemical pressure, bulk modulus remarkably increases, and a high γG is observed for RE = Nd. The dependence of γG on in-plane chemical pressure exhibits a good correlation with Tc, and a higher Tc is achieved when γG is large for RE = Nd. In addition, γG shows a slight decrease by a decrease of F concentration (x) in REO1-xFxBiS2.

Correlation between superconductivity and anharmonicity According to BCS theory, a high phonon energy is preferred for a higher Tc, as revealed in MgB2 [45] and hydride superconductors [46-48]. The target system of this study is BiCh2-based compounds, in which the Bi p electrons contribute to electronic conduction and, hence, superconducting pairing. Because of the heavy Bi atoms, a high phonon energy cannot be expected in BiCh2-based compounds, and a theoretical study suggested that several-K Tc in tetragonal RE(O, F)BiS2 cannot be understood using conventional phonon-mediated models [25]. In addition, the absence of isotope effects on the S or Se sites has been confirmed in tetragonal Bi4O4S3 and La(O, F)BiSSe [16,18]. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms of superconductivity in tetragonal BiCh2-based compounds are different from conventional phonon-mediated weak-coupling superconductivity. Here, we discuss the relationship between the anharmonic atomic vibrations and superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds. In caged compounds, the increase in anharmonicity in the rattling mode (low-energy optical-phonon mode) results in the enhancement of strong-coupling superconductivity and an increase in Tc [33,49]. If the pairing in BiCh2-based systems is mediated by the rattling of Bi, the absence of the isotope effect for the S or Se sites can be explained. In Fig. 6, Tcs of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd) are plotted as functions of γG. As mentioned above, no clear correlation between Tc and γG was observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, which could be due to the constant γG at x = 0.4-1.0. However, we find that Tc increases with increasing γG for Se-free and Se-poor samples, as highlighted by the green curve in Fig. 6, after the addition of the data points of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Here, we excluded x = 0 because the susceptibility does not show bulk superconductivity signals. What is the origin of the large γG, which suggests large anharmonicity in the system? We consider that the onedimensional rattling-like vibrations of Bi atoms along the c-axis contribute to their anharmonicity. Indeed, the softening of these rattling modes was detected using γG in thermoelectric LaOBi(S, Se)2 [29,32]. Therefore, the increase in γG in superconducting REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 with Se-poor compositions is possibly linked to softening of the low-energy phonon mode of Bi in the BiCh2 layers. In the current work, we cannot clarify the cause of the deviation in the data points for the Se-rich samples in Fig. 6, but it would be related to the changes in superconducting states (and/or the influence of anharmonicity on superconductivity) because Se substitution at the Ch1 site largely modifies the chemical bonding and electronic states [10,15]. In addition, we discuss possible changes in characteristics of anharmonic vibration by Se substitution. 4-2. Low-energy phonons Because the discussion above assumes an anharmonic rattling-like vibration in superconducting REO0.5F0.5BiCh2, we examined the presence of low-energy optical phonons in these samples using the specific heat. We performed low-temperature specific heat measurements for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and LaOBiS2-ySey (thermoelectric phase). In materials with low-energy optical phonons, a peak is expected in the plot at a temperature corresponding to approximately a fifth of the phonon energy [50,51]. Because the phonon energy observed in inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is 6-7 meV for LaOBiS2-ySey [32], we expected a peak at approximately 12-14 K. As shown in Fig. S8(a) (Supplemental Materials [43]), the specific heat analysis results for LaOBiS2-ySey confirmed the evolution of a peak structure and the softening of the optical phonon [decrease in peak temperature (Tp)] by Se substitution, which is consistent with the INS results [32]. The analysis results for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are summarized in Fig. 7(a), where (C-γT)/T3 is plotted as functions of temperature. Similar peaks were observed at 12.4-13.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. The peak temperatures were determined by taking the temperature differential of the polynomial-fitting results. The peaks are evidence of low-energy phonon modes in superconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. In addition, the peak temperatures for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are clearly lower than Tp = 14.0 K for LaOBiS2 (y = 0) [see Fig. S8(b)], implying the enhanced anharmonicity by F substitution. Based on the difference in γG, we expected a lower Tp at x = 0.8 than that at x = 0.2, but the obtained results did not corroborate this expectation. Although we have no explanation for this trend, one possible cause is the difference in local structural disorder in samples with lower in-plane CP (e. g., at x = 0 and 0.2). The change in local structure may affect Tp. Furthermore, from Fig. 7(b), we find that the optical phonon energy decreases with Se substitution for x ≤ 0.4, but it increases for further Se",section_header,4.

The ab (T) behavior and RH (T) suggest the existence of unique localization sates. The localization behavior is systematically depressed with increasing Se concentration. MR measurements indicate that WAL is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of WAL and WL emerges around moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of the MC behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates with the results of ab (T) and RH (T). Moreover, the localization regions of the WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the CDW. On the basis of the results shown here, we propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform to study unique localization states, including WAL, and its relation to SOC, electronic ordering, and superconductivity by using the elemental substitution with bulk single crystals. Materials and Methods The single crystals of LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey were prepared by a high-temperature flux method by using a mixture of CsCl and KCl (CsCl: KCl = 5:3) as flux [59, 60]. We first synthesized polycrystalline samples by a conventional solid-state-reaction method [34, 35]. The obtained polycrystalline samples (0.4 g) and the flux (5.0 g) were mixed by a mortar and sealed into evacuated quartz tubes. The tubes were kept at 950 C˚ for 10 hours and slowly cooled to 600 C˚ at a rate of -2 C˚/h. The heated tubes were opened in air and the obtained products were washed and filtered by pure water to remove the flux. The actual compositions of the obtained single crystals were estimated by energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDX) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) TM-3030 (Hitachi High-Tech). The Se concentration y was estimated by the EDX. We use the nominal x-value in this study since the O and F concentration cannot be analyzed by the EDX due to their light mass. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by a Miniflex600 (RIGAKU). The powder XRD patterns for polycrystalline samples were refined by the Rietveld analysis by using RIETAN-FP software [61] and the profiles for single crystalline samples were analyzed by PDIndexer software [62]. The lattice constants a and c for the polycrystalline and single crystals are displayed in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. The crystal structure image was prepared by VESTA [63]. The electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity, and magnetoresistance measurements on the singlecrystalline samples were performed by a conventional four-terminal method in a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) and a GM refrigerator (AXIS). We performed first-principles band-structure calculation based on the density functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation [64] and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [65] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [66-69]. We used the experimental crystal structures determined by our experiment [70]. To represent the O0.5F0.5 occupation in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, one oxygen and one fluorine atom are placed in a 10-atom unit cell. For simplicity, we assumed that selenium atoms occupy inplane chalcogen sites in LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The core electrons in the PAW potential were [Kr]4d10 for La, [He] for O and F, [Xe]4f145d10 for Bi, [Ne] for S, and [Ar]3d10 for Se, respectively. The spin-orbit coupling was included. We took 500 eV of the cutoff energy for the wave function, a 14×14×4 k-mesh, and 0.15 eV of the Gaussian smearing width. ARPES measurements were performed at BL-9A in the Hiroshima Synchrotron Radiation Center (HiSOR) using a R4000 electron analyzer (Scienta Omicron) with p-polarized light. The total energy resolution was set to approximately 30 meV for hν = 30 eV. All samples were cleaved in-situ on the (001) plane in an ultrahigh vacuum of less than 5 × 10-9 Pa. All the measurements were performed at the same temperature of 13 K. The binding energies of the samples were determined by referencing the Fermi energy (EF) of gold electronically contacted with samples. Acknowledgment K.

According to a previous study on isotope effect on Tc [41], phonon-mediated superconductivity is expected in the monoclinic (high-pressure) phases of RE(O, F)BiS2. If modification of phonon characteristics is induced due to the presence of the HEAtype RE site, superconducting properties of RE(O, F)BiS2 should be largely affected. In Ref. 25, we reported that the increase in RE-site ΔSmix suppresses in-plane S-site disorder (in-plane displacement parameter U11) in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. In such situation, atomic vibration characteristics of the BiS2 conducting layers should not be modified, and glassy atomic vibration, which was observed in HEAtype MTe [21], could not be induced in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal structures are clearly different between MTe (simple three-dimensional NaCl-type structure) and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (two-dimensional layered structure). Furthermore, the affections of the disorder at the HEA-type site to electronic and vibrational properties would be depending on the position of the HEAtype site. The pressure studies on MTe and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the incorporation of HEAtype sites is not enough to induce Tc-pinning phenomena, and glassy characteristics of atomic vibration would be the direct cause of the Tc-pinning phenomena in HEA-type superconductors. In conclusion, we have studied the crystal structure evolution of HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressures and confirmed that the HEA-type sample also exhibits a tetragonalmonoclinic transition at a pressure range similar to that for zero-entropy LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Therefore, the increase in RE-site ΔSmix does not affect pressure-structure phase diagram in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. To investigate whether Tc-pinning phenomena occur in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressures, we measured P dependence of Tc by collecting R-T data for RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2. All samples exhibited clear decreases in Tc with increasing pressure in the monoclinic phase, which indicates the absence of Tc-pinning phenomena in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The obtained results are consistent with the scenario that Tc-pinning phenomena occur when glassy atomic vibrations are induced by introduction of HEAtype sites in HEA-type superconductors.

For the Bi4O4S3 sample, no aging effect on XRD was observed, and quite small decrease in Tc (0.2 K) was observed for the 12-years-old sample. As a conclusion, there is almost no aging effects in Bi4O4S3. In contrast, the HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample exhibits a clear aging effect in magnetization data. Tirr decreases from 9.4 to 7.0 K. Because the high-pressuresynthesized sample contain high-pressure strain effects, the aging effects on superconducting properties were observed in 10-years-old samples. As a conclusion, the BiS2-based compounds are stable and their superconducting properties are also robust to aging in air. However, the highpressure strain effects exhibit aging.",section_header,4.

The dependences of T* on the Pb concentration measured by various probes are similar to each other. The large anomaly of thermal expansion, shape of the specific heat anomaly, and the existence of hystereses indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T* from the tetragonal symmetry (P4/nmm). The suppression of Tc at x=0.08 near the phase boundary suggests the close relationship between the lattice structure and superconductivity.",section_header,Conclusion,17553.0,18160.0,607.0,607.0,88.0
