The effect of the element substitution within the superconducting layer on superconductivity in the BiS2-based superconductor NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was investigated. The polycrystalline samples of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 and NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 (x, y = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) were synthesized by the two-step solid state reaction method. When S was substituted by Se, the lattice constant of the a axis increased, and the superconducting properties (Tc and shielding volume fraction) were degraded. When Bi was substituted by Sb, the lattice constant of the c axis decreased, and a metal-insulator transition was observed. The element substitution within the superconducting layer degrades superconductivity in the NdO1-xFxBiS2 system.
