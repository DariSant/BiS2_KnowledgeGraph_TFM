We have synthesized a new BiCh₂-based superconductor system, CeOBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ, which exhibits bulk superconductivity when both local structural parameters and carrier concentration are optimized through Se substitution. Polycrystalline samples of CeOBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ with x = 0–1.0 were prepared by the solid-state reaction method. X-ray diffraction and Rietveld analyses reveal that Se substitution enhances the in-plane chemical pressure and suppresses in-plane disorder. Bond valence sum calculations indicate that the valence of Ce ions decreases with increasing Se content. For x = 0.4 and 0.6, magnetic susceptibility measurements show superconducting transitions with large shielding volume fractions, with the highest superconducting transition temperature Tc = 3 K at x = 0.6. Electrical resistivity measurements demonstrate a zero-resistivity state for x = 0.2–0.8, with the maximum Tc again observed at x = 0.6. Because the CeOBiS₁.₄Se₀.₆ superconductor exhibits reduced disorder in the CeO blocking layer due to the absence of chemical substitution, this material provides a valuable platform for investigating the superconducting mechanism in BiCh₂-based compounds.
