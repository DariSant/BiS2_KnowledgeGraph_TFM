In this review, we introduced the crystal structure and physical properties of  remarkable layered chalcogenide superconductors. Chalcogenides tend to crystallize in a layered structure; hence, the intercalations/deintercalations of ions or molecules at the interlayer site dramatically changes the physical properties and induces exotic superconductivity. The most remarkable family is the Fe chalcogenides, which is the simplest Fe-based superconductor. In this series, the key factors to induce superconductivity are the suppression of antiferromagnetism of Fe planes and the reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe at the interlayer site. The later, reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe can be achieved by oxygen intercalation via annealing in oxygen condition or deintercalation of excess Fe via annealing in acid. Interestingly, red wine is the most effective than any other solution. At the end, we introduced the newly discovered BiS2-based superconducting family. The BiS2 layer is likely to play an important role of the superconductivity, as CuO2 plane of cuprates and FeAn (FeAs, FeP, FeSe or FeTe) layers of Fe-based superconductors. We will be able to create new BiS2-based superconductors with various blocking layers. We believe that unidentified exotic chalcogenide superconductors other than the families introduced here exist and are waiting to be discovered in near future.
