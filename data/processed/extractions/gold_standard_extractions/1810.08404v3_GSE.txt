Suppression of resistivity anomaly by Sn substitution and emergence of bulk superconductivity. Here we discuss the possible origin of the increase in Tc induced by Sn substitution. As revealed by the crystal structure analysis, the lattice parameters are not significantly affected by Sn substitution; therefore, the in-plane chemical pressure in the Bi–S superconducting plane—identified as a key factor for superconductivity in BiS₂-based compounds [24]—is not substantially altered, indicating that the in-plane chemical pressure effect is unlikely to be responsible for the Tc enhancement. Regarding carrier concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases for x = 0.1–0.4, suggesting a small increase in electron carriers; however, the large Tc enhancement at x = 0.4 cannot be explained solely by this modest carrier increase, since the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be minimal. Based on these observations, we consider a possible relationship with charge density wave (CDW) ordering and its suppression by Sn substitution. In the ρ–T curves, an anomaly is observed in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆, similar to the normal-state resistivity anomaly reported for EuFBiS₂ (Tc = 0.3 K), which has been attributed to a CDW transition [29]. We therefore propose that suppression of CDW ordering is responsible for the increased Tc in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆. Consistently, the anomaly temperature T* shifts to lower temperatures with increasing Sn content and disappears at x = 0.3, while Tc reaches its maximum around x = 0.3–0.4, implying that Tc increases as T* is suppressed. Although direct evidence of CDW states and their suppression mechanism is lacking in this system, the introduction of randomness at the M2 site by Sn substitution may effectively destabilize charge ordering. Bulk superconductivity in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃. As shown in the Results section, partial substitution of Se for S induces bulk superconductivity in La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃. Despite the low solubility limit (~5%), the lattice parameters clearly change upon Se substitution and the superconducting properties are markedly enhanced. Although three structural models assuming Se substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites were refined, site selectivity could not be conclusively determined; nevertheless, by analogy with previous BiS₂-based systems [24,32,33], we expect Se to preferentially occupy the in-plane Ch1 site. Based on the established relationship between in-plane chalcogen disorder and superconductivity in BiS₂-based compounds [16,24], we infer that Se substitution suppresses in-plane disorder at the S1 site, thereby inducing bulk superconductivity. Supporting this interpretation, the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient of La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃ is similar to that of Sn-substituted samples (S ≈ −25 μV/K), indicating that the emergence of bulk superconductivity arises from local structural optimization rather than changes in carrier concentration. Given the discovery of bulk superconductivity in the La₂O₂M₄S₆-type layered oxychalcogenide La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₅.₇Se₀.₃, further material development can be anticipated within related layered oxychalcogenide superconductors. Recently, Ruan et al. reported a new superconductor Bi₃O₂S₂Cl with a one-layer-type superconducting layer [34]. Comparative schematic structures of one-layer-type (Bi₃O₂S₂Cl), two-layer-type (RE(O,F)BiS₂), and four-layer-type (La₂O₂M₄S₆-type) systems illustrate that all share similar RE₂O₂ or Bi₂O₂ blocking layers, while variations in the constituent elements of the superconducting layers allow tuning of layer thickness. On this basis, we anticipate the discovery of additional materials with these crystal structures or novel superconductors featuring different numbers of superconducting layers per unit cell. Methods. Polycrystalline samples of La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₁₋ₓSnₓS₆ (x = 0–0.5) and Se-substituted La₂O₂Bi₃Ag₀.₆Sn₀.₄S₆₋zSe_z (z = 0.3, 0.6) were synthesized by solid-state reaction. Stoichiometric amounts of Bi₂O₃, La₂S₃, Sn, AgO, Bi, S, and Se were mixed, pelletized, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and heated at 725 °C for 15 h; for Se-substituted samples, a controlled ramp to 725 °C over 1 h was required to suppress impurity formation. Samples were reground, repelletized, and reheated under identical conditions. Phase purity and annealing conditions were verified by Cu-Kα X-ray diffraction, lattice parameters were refined using RIETAN-FP [35], and crystal structures were visualized with VESTA [36]. Compositions were confirmed by EDX using a Hitachi TM3030 SEM. Magnetic susceptibility was measured using a SQUID magnetometer (MPMS-3), resistivity was measured by the four-terminal method using PPMS down to 0.4 K (³He probe) and 0.1 K (ADR option), and Seebeck coefficients were measured at 300 K using ZEM-3; all samples are referenced by nominal composition.
