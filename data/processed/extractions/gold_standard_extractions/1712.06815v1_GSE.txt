In conclusion, we investigated the crystal structure and anisotropic displacement parameters of REO₀.₅F₀.₅BiS₂ with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, where bulk superconductivity is induced by substitution with smaller-radius rare-earth ions such as Pr or Nd. As the ionic radius of RE³⁺ decreases, both the lattice constant a and the in-plane Bi–S1 distance monotonically decrease, leading to the generation of an in-plane chemical pressure effect. Simultaneously, the in-plane disorder at the S1 sites is significantly suppressed with decreasing RE³⁺ ionic radius. This behavior closely resembles the trends observed in Se-substituted LaO₀.₅F₀.₅BiS₂₋ₓSeₓ and Eu₀.₅La₀.₅FBiS₂₋ₓSeₓ systems. Consequently, the emergence of bulk superconductivity associated with the suppression of in-plane disorder at the Ch1 sites appears to be a universal mechanism in BiCh₂-based superconductors. Furthermore, analysis of the displacement parameters along the c-axis reveals that the amplitude of the one-dimensional vibration of S1 (or Ch1) along the c-axis is correlated with the superconducting transition temperature Tc in this family of materials.
