Suppression of resistivity anomaly by the Sn substitution Here, we discuss the possible origin of the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. As revealed in the crystal structure part, the lattice parameters were not largely affected by the Sn substitution. Therefore, in-plane chemical pressure amplitude in the Bi-S superconducting plane, which has been revealed as the essential parameter for the emergence of superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds [24], should not be significantly changed. Therefore, we consider that the in-plane chemical pressure effect is not the origin for the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. On carrier concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases by Sn substitution for x = 0.1-0.4, which can be corresponding to the slight increase in electron carriers by Sn substitution. However, the large increase in Tc for x = 0.4 may not be understood from the increase in carrier concentration only because the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be quite small. On the basis of these facts, we briefly mention about the possible relation to the CDW ordering and the possible scenario of the suppression of CDW by Sn substitution in this system. In the -T plots, an anomaly was observed in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system. A similar feature in the normal-state resistivity has been observed in the EuFBiS2 superconductor (Tc = 0.3 K). The origin of the hump was proposed as a CDW transition [29]. We assume that the suppression of the CDW ordering is the origin for the increased Tc in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. In addition, the anomaly temperature T* was shifted to a lower temperature by Sn substitution, and the anomaly disappeared at x = 0.3. At around x = 0.3 and 0.4, Tc is the maximum. These facts imply that Tc increased by the suppression of T*. Although we have no evidence for the CDW states in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system and the suppression mechanism by the Sn substitution, introduction of randomness at the M2 site may be effective to suppress the charge ordering states. Bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 As shown in the Result part, a partial Se substitution for S induced bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. Although the solubility limit is very low (5%), the lattice parameters clearly changed by the partial Se substitution, and the superconducting properties were significantly improved. Although we refined three models with different Se site (assuming the substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites), we could not find the site selectivity of doped Se. However, we expect that the doped Se occupies the Ch1 site in the inset of Fig. 6. In previous reports on the Se substitution in BiS2-based compounds, the site selectivity of Se at the in-plane site was observed [24,32,33]. According to the relationship between in-plane disorder at the chalcogen site and superconductivity in BiS2-based systems [16,24], we assume that Se substitution reduced the inplane disorder at the S1 site and induced bulk superconductivity. Furthermore, the roomtemperature Seebeck coefficient for the La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 sample was similar to those shown in Fig. 4 (S = -25 V/K). This also suggests that the bulk nature of superconductivity was induced by local structural optimization but not due to changes in carrier concentration. Since we have reported the emergence of bulk superconductivity in La2O2M4S6-type layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3, we can expect material development in related fourlayer-type oxychalcogenide superconductors. Recently, a new superconductor Bi3O2S2Cl with the one-layer-type superconducting layer was discovered by Ruan et al. [34]. In Fig. 8, schematic images of typical one-layer-type (Fig. 8a), two-layer-type (Fig. 8b), and four-layer-type (Fig. 8c) are displayed for comparison. All the materials have the similar RE2O2 or Bi2O2 blocking layer. By changing the constituent elements in the superconducting layers, the thickness can be changed in this superconductor family. On the basis of these facts, we expect further development of materials with these crystal structures or novel materials with a superconducting layer with a different thickness (number of the superconducting layers in a unit cell).

Methods The polycrystalline samples of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The polycrystalline samples of Se-substituted La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez with z = 0.3 and 0.6 were also prepared by a solid-state reaction method. Powders (or grains) of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Sn (99.99%), and AgO (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6zSez were mixed in a pestle and mortar, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated in an electric furnace. The heat treatment condition was 725 °C for 15 h for both samples. However, for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez, heating the sample to 725 °C in 1 h was needed to suppress the generation of impurity phases. The obtained samples were reground for homogeneity, pelletized, and heated in the same procedure. The phase purity of the prepared samples and the optimal annealing conditions were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation. The lattice parameters were determined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [35]. Schematic image of the crystal structure was drawn using VESTA [36]. The actual composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on scanning electron microscope TM3030 (Hitachi). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-3, Quantum Design). The susceptibility data were taken after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] was measured by four-terminal method on the Physical Property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity measurement down to 0.4 K was measured using a 3He probe platform of PPMS. The ADR system on PPMS was used for resistivity measurements down to 0.1 K. For clarity, we labeled the examined samples with the nominal compositions. The Seebeck coefficient was measured by a four-probe method on ZEM-3 (Advance RIKO) at 300 K.
