In this study, we have performed synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction for the new BiS2-based superconductor system Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, in which the bulk superconductivity was induced by Se substitution. The obtained structural parameters suggest four structural tendencies: (1) the selective occupancy of Se at the in-plane Ch1 site, (2) the direct correlation between Bi-Ch bond distances and the lattice constants, (3) the enhancement of the in-plane chemical pressure, and (4) the suppression of the in-plane disorder by Se substitution. These results will be useful for understanding the relationship between superconductivity and crystal structure in the BiCh2-based superconductor family.
