we investigated the crystal structure and anisotropic displacement parameters of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, where bulk superconductivity is induced by substitutions with a smaller-radius RE, such as Pr or Nd. With the decrease of the RE3+ ionic radius, the lattice constant a and in-plane Bi-S1 distance monotonically decreased, which generated the in-plane chemical pressure effect. With the decrease of the RE3+ radius, the in-plane disorder of the S1 sites significantly decreased. This trend is very similar to those observed for Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Therefore, the emergence of bulk superconductivity upon the suppression of the in-plane disorder at the Ch1 sites seems to be a universal scenario for the BiCh2based superconductors. The analyses of the displacement parameters along the c-axis indicated that the amplitude of the one-dimensional vibration of S1 (or Ch1) along the c-axis was correlated with Tc in the BiCh2-based superconductors.
