Abstract 
 
We have systematically investigated the crystal structure and the magnetic 
properties of BiS2-based superconductor Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (x = 0 - 1.0, y = 0.3, 0.5 and 
0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (x = 0 - 0.8, y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). In the REOBiS2 system, both 
crystal structure and physical properties are tunable by substituting with the different RE 
(RE = rare earth) elements, having a different ionic radius, such as Ce, Nd and Sm. 
 
In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system, bulk superconductivity is observed for x = 1.0 
with y = 0.3 and x ≥ 0.5 with y = 0.5. The transition temperature (Tc) increases with 
increasing Nd concentration. The highest Tc is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5 in the 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. By the Nd substitution for Ce, lattice contraction along the a 
axis is generated while the c axis does not show a remarkable dependence on Nd 
concentration. The lattice constant of c decreases with increasing F concentration. 
 
Furthermore, we found that the Nd site can be replaced by smaller Sm ions up to z 
= 0.8 in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. Bulk superconductivity is observed within z ≤ 0.8 for y = 0.3 
and z ≤ 0.6 for y = 0.5. The Tc increases with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 
5.6 K for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. With increasing Sm concentration, the lattice constant of a 
decreases while the lattice constants of c does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm 
concentration. 
 
We found that the chemical pressure generated by systematic solution of the RE 
site in the blocking layer commonly induces lattice contraction along the a axis in 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. The obtained results indicate that both optimal 
F concentration and uniaxial lattice contraction along the a axis generated by chemical 
pressure are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity in the REO1-yFyBiS2 
system.

1. Introduction 
 
Layered materials have been studied in the field of superconductivity because 
superconductors with a high transition temperature (Tc) had been discovered in layered 
materials, as were the Cu-oxide[1] and the Fe-based superconductors[2]. Recently, several 
types of BiS2-based layered superconductors such as Bi4O4S3
[3], REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, 
Pr, Nd)[4-9] and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2
[10,11] were discovered. The crystal structure of the BiS2-based 
superconductor is composed of an alternate stacking of double BiS2 conduction layers and 
blocking layers such as Bi4O4(SO4)1-x, RE2O2, or Sr2F2 layers. Band calculation suggested 
that the parent material is a band insulator, and the BiS2-based materials become 
superconductive when electron carriers were generated at the Bi-6p orbitals within the BiS2 
conduction layers[3,12]. LaO1-xFxBiS2 is a typical BiS2-based superconductor. The parent 
phase LaOBiS2 is semiconducting, and partial substitution of the O site by F generates 
electron carrier within the BiS2 layers. Recently, it was reported that optimization of crystal 
structure is important for the inducement of superconductivity in the LaO1-xFxBiS2 system 
as well as electron carriers. Namely, the crystal structure and the superconducting properties 
strongly correlate in the BiS2 family. One of the notable characteristics is positive pressure 
effect on Tc
 [13-18]. The Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 largely increases from 3 K to 11 K by application 
of external high pressure or sample synthesis under high pressure. 
 
On the other hand, Substitution with isovalent elements generates chemical pressure. It 
is useful for discussing the relationship between crystal structure and superconducting 
properties to study the chemical pressure effects on superconductivity in this system because 
superconducting properties are tunable by application of chemical pressure in several layered 
materials. Recently, we have studied the chemical pressure effect on superconducting properties 
in BiS2-based Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2
[20]
. As a result of the study, we found that the lattice contracts 
along the a axis, and bulk superconductivity was induced with increasing Nd concentration (x). 
To clarify the relationship between crystal structure and superconducting properties in detail and 
to increase Tc, we have systematically investigated chemical pressure effect in 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 systems.  
 
 
2. Experimental details 
 
The polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 were prepared by solid-state 
reaction using powders of Ce2S3 (99.9 %), Nd2S3 (99 %), Bi2O3 (99.99 %), BiF3 (99.9 %), Bi2S3 
and grains of Bi (99.999 %). The polycrystalline samples of Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 were prepared 


4 
 
by solid-state reaction using powders of Nd2S3 (99 %), Sm2S3 (99.9 %), Bi2O3 (99.99 %), BiF3 
(99.9 %), Bi2S3 and grains of Bi (99.999 %). The Bi2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Bi 
(99.999 %) and S (99.99 %) grains in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals were purchased 
from Kojundo-Kagaku laboratory. The starting materials with a nominal composition of 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 were well-mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in an 
evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700ºC for 10h. The obtained products were ground, sealed 
in an evacuated quartz tube and heated again with the same heating conditions for crystal 
homogenization. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction using 
theθ−2θ method. The temperature dependence of magnetization was measured by a 
superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied magnetic 
field of 5 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). 
 
 
3. Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 
 
Figure 1(a), (c) and (e) show X-ray diffraction patterns for Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 with y = 
0.7, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. Almost all of the observed peaks are explained using the 
tetragonal P4/nmm space group. The numbers displayed with the X-ray patterns indicate Miller 
indices. To analyze the change in the lattice constant of a axis, the enlarged X-ray diffraction 
patterns near the (200) peak for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 samples with y = 0.7, 0.5 and 0.3 are 
shown in Fig. 1(b), (d) and (f), respectively. It is clear that the peak position of the (200) peak 
systematically shifts to higher angles with increasing Nd concentration (x) for y = 0.7, 0.5 and 
0.3. These results indicate the lattice constant of a decreases with increasing Nd concentration 
(x). In contrast, the (00l) peaks do not show a remarkable dependence on Nd concentration, 
indicating that the substitution of the RE site does not affect the c axis length. To clarify the 
relationship between RE (RE = Ce and Nd) concentration and lattice constants of a and c, the 
lattice constants were calculated using the observed peak positions of the (200) and (004) peaks. 
The calculated lattice constants a and c for all the samples of Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 
and 0.7) are plotted in Fig. 2(a) and (b). With increasing Nd concentration (x), the lattice 
constant of a monotonously decreases for all F concentrations (y) while the lattice constant of c 
does not show a remarkable dependence on Nd concentration. However, the lattice constants of 
c decrease with increasing F concentration. This result indicates the partial substitution of O by 
F generates lattice contraction along the c axis while the partial substitution for Ce by Nd 
generates lattice contraction along the a axis. 
 
Figure 3(a) and (b) show the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for 


5 
 
Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2. The onset of Tc (Tc
onset) was defined as a temperature where the 
temperature derivative of magnetic susceptibility (dχ/dT) becomes negative in ZFC condition. 
The ∆χ was defined as an absolute value of the difference between χ at Tc
onset and χ at 2 K to 
investigate the bulk characteristics of the samples. In Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2, a superconducting 
transition is observed within a wide Nd-concentration range of x = 0.0 - 1.0 as shown in Fig. 
3(a) and (b) though the diamagnetic signals are weak: the value of ∆χ is lower than 0.05 
emu/Oe·cm3. The Tc
onset increases with increasing Nd concentration and reaches 4.8 K for x = 
1.0 (NdO0.3F0.7BiS2). Furthermore, for x = 0 - 0.8, the magnetic transition with a magnetic 
transition temperature (Tmag) of about 7.5 K is observed. The Tmag was difined as the temperature 
at which χ abruptly increases along with the appearance of magnetic ordering of the RE site. 
The results are similar with the previous studies on magnetic properties of CeO1-xFxBiS2
[5,6,21]. In 
fact, the magnetism is due to the ordering of the Ce moment of the blocking layer. It is quite 
interesting that even the sample with x = 0.8, which contains 80 % of Nd ions, shows magnetic 
transition like ferromagnetism observed in CeO1-xFxBiS2. 
 
In Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, bulk superconductivity is observed within x ≥ 0.5 as shown in 
Fig. 3(c). The largest value of ∆χ  is observed for x = 1.0. The Tc
onset increases with increasing 
Nd concentration and reaches 4.8 K for x = 1.0. The magnetism observed in 
Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 does not appear in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
 
In Ce1-xNdxO0.7F0.3BiS2, filamentary superconductivity is observed for x = 0.8, and 
bulk superconductivity is observed only for x = 1.0 with Tc
onset = 3.6 K as shown in Fig. 3(d). 
The magnetism observed in Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 does not appear in Ce1-xNdxO0.7F0.3BiS2. 
 
Figure 4 shows Nd concentration dependence of Tc
onset for Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 
0.5 and 0.7). The symbols of × indicate that the sample at this point does not exhibit a 
superconducting transition at above 2 K. With increasing Nd concentration, the Tc
onset increases 
for all system, and the maximum value of Tc
onset is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5 in 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. Furthermore, the Nd concentration, at which superconductivity is induced, 
depends on the F concentration (y). For Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2, superconducting transition is 
observed for x = 0 – 1.0 but the induced superconductivity is not bulk in nature. For 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, bulk superconductivity is induced for x ≥ 0.5. For Ce1-xNdxO0.7F0.3BiS2, 
bulk superconductivity is observed only for x = 1.0. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system, a higher 
Nd concentration (x) and optimal F concentration (y) are important for inducement of bulk 
superconductivity.

4. Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 
 
To further investigate the effects of chemical pressure, we prepared polycrystalline 
samples of Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 for the first time. Figure 5(a), (c) and (e) show X-ray diffraction 
patterns for Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 with y = 0.7, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. Almost all of the 
observed peaks are explained using the tetragonal P4/nmm space group. In the 
Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, impurity phases are clearly observed 
when the Sm concentration z is 0.8 as indicated by symbols of *, which indicates that there is a 
solubility limit of Sm with Nd for the RE site. For Nd1-zSmzO0.7F0.3BiS2, impurity phases are not 
observed for z = 0 – 0.8. Figure 5(b), (d) and (f) show the enlarged X-ray diffraction patterns 
near the (200) peak for the Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 samples with y = 0.7, 0.5 and 0.3, respectively. 
As shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d), the peak position of the (200) peak systematically shifts to higher 
angles with increasing Sm concentration (z) in Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO0.5F0.5BiS2. In 
Nd1-zSmzO0.7F0.3BiS2, the peak position of the (200) peak largely shifts to higher angles from z = 
0.2 to z = 0.4, while the peak position of the (200) peak does not show a remarkable change 
within z = 0.4 – 0.8. There might be a local structure transition at a boundary between z = 0.2 
and 0.4. To clarify the relationship between RE (RE = Nd and Sm) concentration and lattice 
constants, the lattice constants a and c were calculated using the peak positions of the (200) and 
(004) peaks.  
 
The lattice constants of a and c for all the samples of Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 
and 0.7) are plotted in Fig. 6(a) and (b), respectively. With increasing Sm concentration (z), the 
lattice constant of a monotonously decreases for y = 0.5 and 0.7 while the lattice constant of c 
does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm concentration (z). The lattice constant of the a 
axis for y = 0.3 shows a large drop at around z = 0.2 – 0.4. These results indicate that the partial 
substitution for Nd by Sm generates lattice contraction of a axis. The lattice constants of a in 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is shorter than that of the shortest value of a axis in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. This 
indicates that the effect of chemical pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is clearly larger than that in 
the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. 
 
Figure 7(a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for 
Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2. In Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2, a superconducting transition is observed within z 
≤ 0.6 but ∆χ is very small as observed in Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2. Namely, bulk superconductivity 
cannot be induced for y = 0.7 by chemical pressure in a line of Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. Figure 7(b) shows the enlarged temperature dependence of magnetic 
susceptibility for Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2. The Tc
onset decreases with increasing Sm concentration. 
 
In Nd1-zSmzO0.5F0.5BiS2, superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6. The ∆χ is 


7 
 
clearly larger than those of Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2, indicating the superconducting state is bulk in 
nature. But, the value of ∆χ relatively decreases with increasing Sm concentration as shown in 
Fig. 7(c). The Tc
onset increases with increasing Sm concentration as shown in Fig. 7(d) and 
reaches 5.5 K for z = 0.6. 
 
In Nd1-zSmzO0.7F0.3BiS2, bulk superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8. 
Similarly to Nd1-zSmzO0.5F0.5BiS2,the ∆χ  tends to relatively decrease with increasing Sm 
concentration as shown in Fig. 7(e) but Tc
onset increases with increasing Sm concentration as 
shown in Fig. 7(f) and reaches 5.6 K for z = 0.8.  
 
Figure 8 shows the Sm concentration dependence of Tc
onset for Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 
0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). The symbols of × indicate that the sample at this point does not exhibit a 
superconducting transition at above 2 K. Bulk superconductivity is observed for 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 with 
y = 0.5 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 with y = 0.3. The Tc
onset increases with increasing Sm concentration for y 
= 0.3 and 0.5 while the Tc
onset decreases with increasing Sm concentration for y = 0.7. 
 
 
5. Phase diagram 
 
To understand the obtained results and discuss relationship between the chemical 
pressure effect and the inducement of bulk superconductivity, we have established three kinds of 
phase diagram. 
 
Figure 9 shows a chemical pressure-∆χ phase diagram for Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 
0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). The data points of 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 are plotted in the left area of broken line. The data points of 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 are shown in the right area of the broken line. The chemical pressure in the 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 system is larger than that in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system because the ionic 
radius becomes smaller in the order of Ce3+, Nd3+ and Sm3+. In this phase diagram, we can 
discuss whether the superconducting states induced by chemical pressure are bulk or filamentary. 
We note that the samples of y = 0.7 do not exhibit bulk superconductivity because the values of 
∆χ for all the samples with y = 0.7 are lower than 0.05 emu/Oe·cm3. In fact, bulk 
superconductivity is not induced by chemical pressure for y = 0.7. We consider that the absence 
of bulk superconductivity is due to the higher F concentration. The high F concentration may 
result in a crystal structure unfavorable for the appearance of superconductivity. One possibility 
is the formation of coupling between the REO blocking layer and the BiS superconducting 
plane. Recent x-ray absorption spectroscopy measurements indicated that the RE-Bi coupling 
via the out-plane S atom (RE-S-Bi channel) could form in CeO1-yFyBiS2
[21]. When the Ce-S-Bi 


8 
 
channel is formed, both superconductivity and magnetic ordering are not observed in 
CeO1-yFyBiS2. In contrast, both superconductivity and magnetic ordering are observed when the 
Ce-S-Bi channel is not formed. In Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2, however, magnetic ordering of the RE 
site is clearly observed for 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.8. This indicates that there is no RE-S-Bi coupling. 
Therefore, we assume that the other factor affects the appearance of bulk superconductivity in 
the present REO0.3F0.7BiS2 system. The possible reason is excess electron carriers within the 
BiS2 layers, which may be unfavorable for the appearance of bulk superconductivity in the 
REO0.3F0.7BiS2 (y = 0.7) system. To clarify the reason for the absence of bulk superconductivity 
in y = 0.7, studies using single crystals are needed. 
 For y = 0.5 and 0.3, the value of ∆χ clearly increases with increasing Nd concentration in 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 up to x = 1.0, indicating the inducement of bulk superconductivity by 
chemical pressure. Then, the value of ∆χ slightly decreases with increasing Sm concentration in 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2, but those are still large value even with a higher Sm concentration (z). Here, 
we define a criterion of ∆χ > 0.05 emu/Oe·cm3 for bulk superconducting states to discuss the 
essential relationship between chemical pressure effect, crystal structure and Tc. 
 
To discuss the correlation between chemical pressure effect and Tc, we plotted a 
chemical pressure-Tc phase diagram for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) in Fig. 10. The data points of Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 are 
plotted in the left area of broken line. The data points of Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 are shown in the 
right area of the broken line. The symbols of × indicate that the sample at this point does not 
exhibit a superconducting transition at above 2 K. The open symbols indicate the Tc
onset in a 
filamentary superconductivity state. The filled symbols indicate the Tc
onset in a bulk 
superconductivity state. 
 
For the F concentration of y = 0.7, filamentary superconductivity is observed for all 
the samples of Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 as shown in Fig. 10(a). On the 
superconducting transition temperature, the Tc
onset increases with increasing chemical pressure in 
Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2, and it decreases with increasing chemical pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2. 
 For the F concentration of y = 0.5, bulk superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.5 as shown in 
Fig. 10(b). The Tc
onset continues to increase with increasing chemical pressure in a wide range of 
x = 0.4 – 1.0 and z = 0 - 0.6. For y = 0.3, bulk superconductivity is observed for x = 1.0 in 
Ce1-xNdxO0.7F0.3BiS2 and all the samples of Nd1-zSmzO0.7F0.3BiS2 as shown in Fig. 10(c). The 
Tc
onset increases with increasing chemical pressure in a wide range from z = 0 (x = 1.0) to z = 0.8. 
Having considered the phase diagram for y = 0.5 and 0.3, we find that the RE concentration, at 
which bulk superconductivity is induced, clearly depends on F concentration (y). In the 


9 
 
REO1-yFyBiS2 family, both lattice contraction of the a axis by chemical pressure and optimal F 
concentration seem to be essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity. 
 
Finally, we discuss the relationship between Tc and lattice constants in detail. Figure 
11 shows the c/a ratio dependence of Tc
onset for Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3 and 0.5) and 
Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3 and 0.5). With the criterion of ∆χ > 0.05 emu/Oe·cm3, we excluded 
the data points of filamentary superconductors in this plot. We note that the c/a ratio approaches 
a characteristic area around 3.39 when the Tc becomes higher for both y = 0.5 and 0.3 as 
indicated by an orange square in Fig. 11. This implies that a larger c/a ratio is important for a 
higher Tc in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 system. The uniaxial lattice 
contraction (chemical pressure) along the a axis is the strongest at this region. Therefore, both 
uniaxial contraction along the a axis generated by chemical pressure and optimal F 
concentration are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity with a higher Tc in the 
REO1-yFyBiS2 superconductors.  
 
 
6. Conclusion 
 
We have systematically investigated the crystal structure and magnetic properties of 
BiS2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y 
= 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) to investigate the chemical pressure effects on superconductivity of the 
REO1-yFyBiS2 systems. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 samples, bulk superconductivity is observed 
for x ≥ 0.5 with y = 0.5 and x = 1.0 with y = 0.3. The Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit 
filamentary superconductivity. The Tc
onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 commonly increases with 
increasing Nd concentration. The highest Tc
onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 
with y = 0.5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the systematic substitution of Ce by Nd 
generates chemical pressure along the a axis while c axis does not show a remarkable change on 
Nd concentration. The lattice constants of c get shorter with increasing F concentration. This 
result indicates the partial substitution of O by F generates lattice contraction along c axis. 
Furthermore, we found that Nd can be replaced by smaller Sm ions, up to z = 0.8. Bulk 
superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 with y = 0.3 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 with y = 0.5. The 
Tc
onset in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 increased with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 5.6 K 
for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. The Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity 
within a range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.4. With increasing Sm concentration, the lattice constant of a 
decreases while the lattice constant of c does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm 
concentration. The lattice constant of a in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is shorter than that of the shortest 


10 
 
value of the lattice constant of a in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. This indicates that the effect of chemical 
pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is clearly larger than that in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. 
 
We established a three kinds of phase diagram for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 
and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). On the basis of the phase diagrams, both 
lattice contraction of a axis and optimal F concentration are essential for the inducement of bulk 
superconductivity in REO1-yFyBiS2. Furthermore, the c/a ratio of the higher Tc samples is 
concentrated at near c/a = 3.39. Within this region, the chemical pressure along the a axis is the 
strongest in the studied samples. Therefore, both uniaxial contraction along the a axis generated 
by chemical pressure and optimal F concentration are important for the inducement of bulk 
superconductivity with a higher Tc in the REO1-yFyBiS2 superconductors.
