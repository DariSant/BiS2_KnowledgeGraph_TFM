Abstract 
F-substituted NdOBiS2 superconducting single crystals were grown using CsCl/KCl 
flux. This is the first example of the single-crystal growth of a BiS2-based 
superconductor. The obtained single crystals had a plate-like shape with a size of 1-2 
mm and a well-developed ab-plane. The crystal structure of the grown crystals was 
determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis to be the tetragonal space group 
P4/nmm (#129) with a = 3.996(3) Å and c = 13.464(6) Å. The chemical formula of the 
grown crystals was approximately Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2, and Cs, K, and Cl

were not detected in the grown crystals by electron probe microanalysis. The grown 
crystals had a critical temperature of approximately 5 K. The superconducting 
anisotropy of the single crystals was estimated to be about 30 from the effective mass 
model and the upper critical field.

Main text 
Since the discovery of the BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3,1) RO1-xFxBiS2 (R=La, 
Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb),2-6) and Sr1−yLayFBiS2,7) much effort has been focused on the growth of 
their single crystals. Single crystals of BiS2-based superconductors are attracting much 
attention because they will enable the analysis of their intrinsic physical properties. 
However, bulk-size single crystals of BiS2-based superconductors have never been 
grown. Alkali chloride fluxes are useful for obtaining single crystals. So far, single 
crystals of Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3Oy high-Tc superconductors have been 
grown using KCl flux.8-10) However, BiS2-based superconductors cannot be synthesized 
using KCl flux in a vacuum quartz tube because KCl would corrode the quartz tube at 
high temperatures. Therefore, a mixture of CsCl and KCl (CsCl/KCl) is a promising 
flux as it exhibits little reactivity to quartz tubes at high temperatures.11-13)  
In this paper, we focus on the compound NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1–0.7), which was found 
to have a maximum Tc of 5.6 K at x=0.3.5) We report the successful growth of 
F-substituted NdOBiS2 single crystals using CsCl/KCl as the flux with a eutectic 
temperature of approximately 616 °C in a quartz tube sealed in vacuum. For the first 
time, the crystal structure of the grown crystals was determined by single-crystal X-ray

diffraction (XRD) analysis. The composition and superconducting properties were also 
investigated to characterize the properties of the single crystals.  
Single crystals of F-substituted NdOBiS2 were grown in a quartz tube sealed in 
vacuum by a high-temperature flux method. The raw materials used were Nd2S3, Bi, 
Bi2S3, Bi2O3, BiF3, CsCl, and KCl.  
The raw materials were weighed with a nominal composition of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The 
mixture of the raw materials (0.8 g) and CsCl/KCl flux (3.0 g) were mixed using a 
mortar, and sealed in a quartz tube in vacuum. The molar ratio of the CsCl/KCl flux was 
CsCl:KCl=5:3. The mixed powder was then heated at 800 °C for 10 h followed by slow 
cooling to 600 °C at a rate of 0.5 °C/h. The sample was then furnace-cooled from 
600 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the quartz tube was opened in air 
atmosphere, and distilled water was added to the quartz tube. The product was then 
filtered and washed with distilled water.  
The crystal structure and composition of the single crystals were evaluated by XRD 
analysis using CuKα radiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and electron 
probe microanalysis (EPMA). Single-crystal XRD data were collected using a Rigaku 
XTALAB-MINI diffractometer with graphite monochromated MoKα radiation. The 
data were corrected for the Lorentz and polarization effects. The crystal structure was 


 
6
solved and refined using computer programs from the Crystal Structure crystallographic 
software package.14) Details of the data collection and refinement are summarized in 
Table I. The crystal structure was drawn by VESTA computer software.15) The 
temperature dependence of magnetization was measured by a superconducting quantum 
interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 10 Oe. The transport 
properties of the single crystals were measured by the standard four-probe method with 
constant current density (J) using a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement 
System (PPMS). The transition temperature corresponding to the onset of 
superconductivity (Tc
onset) was defined as the point at which deviation from linear 
behavior is observed in the normal conducting state in the resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) 
characteristics. The zero resistivity (Tc
zero) was determined considering the criterion of a 
resistivity of 0.1 μΩcm in the ρ-T characteristics. We measured the angular (θ) 
dependence of resistivity (ρ) in the flux liquid state under various magnetic fields (H) 
and calculated the superconducting anisotropy (γs) using the effective mass model.16-18)  
Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of a F-substituted NdOBiS2 single crystal. The 
obtained single crystals had a plate-like shape of side 1.0-2.0 mm and 10-20 μm 
thickness. We did not measure the in-plane orientation of the grown crystals. Figure 2 
shows an XRD pattern of a well-developed plane of a F-substituted NdOBiS2 single

crystal. The grown single crystals were identified to have the NdOBiS2 structure from 
the XRD pattern. The presence of only 00l diffraction peaks of the NdOBiS2 structure 
indicates that the ab-plane is well-developed.  
The structural analysis showed that the crystal structure was the tetragonal space group 
P4/nmm (#129) with a = 3.996(3) Å, and c = 13.464(6) Å. Structural refinement was 
performed on NdOBiS2 because it is difficult to distinguish between O and F. In the 
initial refinement, the occupations of Nd and Bi were refined and found to be unity 
within the error. Thus, no defects of Nd and Bi sites were detected. The final refinement 
was performed with fixed occupancies of unity for Nd, Bi, S, and O. The obtained 
atomic coordinates are summarized in Table II. As shown in Fig. 3, the crystal structure 
of NdOBiS2 is composed of stacked Nd2O2 layers and Bi2S4 layers, which is almost the 
same as the LaOBiS2 structure.2) The composition of the F-substituted NdOBiS2 single 
crystals was estimated to be approximately Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 by 
EPMA. The obtained values were normalized using S = 2. Nd and Bi were measured to 
a precision of two decimal places. On the other hand, O and F are accurate to one 
decimal place. These values are consistent with the crystal structure analysis within the 
analytical error. The measured values of the lattice constants a and c in the grown 
crystals are comparable to those of a polycrystalline powder sample with a F content of

0.3±0.1.5) Cs, K, and Cl were not detected in the grown single crystals by quantitative 
analysis using EPMA with a minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 wt%.  
Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for a 
Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 single crystal. The Meissner effect was confirmed 
from the magnetic susceptibility between 2 and 20 K. Figure 5 shows the ρ-T 
characteristics along the ab-plane of a Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 single crystal. 
A superconducting transition was observed below 6 K. Tc
onset is 5.5 K and Tc
zero was 
observed at 5.0 K. Resistivity slightly decreases with decreasing temperature down to 6 
K, which is metallic behavior. This is different from the property of polycrystalline 
samples of semiconducting behavior down to approximately 6 K.5,6,19) We assume that 
intrinsic property of Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 single crystal is metallic, and 
that the transport property of the polycrystalline sample is semiconducting owing to the 
existence of grain boundaries. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity 
below 10 K under a magnetic field (H) of 0-9.0 T parallel to the (a) ab-plane and (b) 
c-axis. The resistivity in the normal state exhibits metallic behavior under a magnetic 
field parallel to the ab-plane. On the other hand, an upturn is observed in the resistivity 
under a magnetic field of more than 0.5 T parallel to the c-axis, which appears to be 
semiconducting behavior. Further investigation is underway to clarify this phenomenon.

The suppression of the critical temperature under the magnetic field applied parallel to 
the c-axis is more significant than that for a field parallel to the ab-plane. The field 
dependences of Tc
onset and Tc
zero under the magnetic fields (H) parallel to the ab-plane 
(H//ab-plane) and c-axis (H//c-axis) are plotted in Fig. 7. The linear extrapolations of 
Tc
onset for the case of H//ab-plane and H//c-axis approach values of 42 and 1.3 T, 
respectively. The upper critical fields H//ab
C2 and H//c
C2 are predicted to be less than 42 
and 1.3 T, respectively. Using linear fitting to the Tc
zero data, the irreversibility fields 
H//ab
irr and H//c
irr are found to be 16 and 0.64 T, respectively. This result indicates that 
the F-substituted NdOBiS2 superconductor has high anisotropy. We previously 
estimated the superconducting anisotropy of Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 using a 
single crystal. The angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) was measured at various 
magnetic fields (H) in the flux liquid state to estimate the superconducting anisotropy 
(γs) of a grown Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 single crystal, as reported in Refs. 16 
and 17. The reduced field (Hred) is evaluated using the following equation for the 
effective mass model:  
Hred = H(sin2θ+γs
-2cos2θ)1/2,                   (1) 
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field.18) Hred is calculated 
from H and θ. The superconducting anisotropy (γs) was estimated from the best scaling 


 
10 
for the ρ-Hred relations. Figure 8 shows the angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) at 
various magnetic fields (H = 0.1-9.0 T) in the flux liquid state for a 
Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2 single crystal. Small dips were observed in the ρ-θ 
curves around the H//c-axis at magnetic fields of less than 0.6 T. These dips presumably 
originated from small cracks, which behave as weak pinning sites in the single crystal. 
The ρ-θ curve had twofold symmetry. The ρ-Hred scaling obtained from the ρ-θ curves in 
Fig. 8 using Eq. (1) is shown in Fig. 9. The scaling is obtained by taking γs = 30, shown 
in Fig. 9(a). However, this plot deviates from the scaling at a higher field of more than 
2.5 T as shown in Fig. 8. As described before, H//c
C2 was predicted to be less than 1.3 T 
from Fig. 7. Assuming that γs diverges at magnetic field of more than 1.3 T, we perform 
ρ-Hred scaling only using data from Fig. 8 obtained at magnetic fields of less than or 
equal to 1.0 T, as shown in Fig. 9(b). The best scaling for this set of data was obtained 
by taking γs = 9. However, when γs was more than 9, the ρ-Hred scaling was almost 
saturated at magnetic fields of less than or equal to 1.0 T. On the other hand, the 
superconducting anisotropy evaluated from the ratio of the upper critical field using the 
equation:  
γs = H//ab
C2/H//c
C2 = ξab/ξc  (ξ: coherence length)          (2) 
was 32.3. We assume that the superconducting anisotropy was estimated to be 


 
11
approximately 30.  
We have successfully grown F-substituted NdOBiS2 single crystals using CsCl/KCl 
flux. Plate-like F-substituted NdOBiS2 single crystals with a size of about 1.0-2.0 mm 
were obtained. The structure of the grown crystals was determined to be the tetragonal 
space group P4/nmm (#129) with a = 3.996(3) Å and c = 13.464(6) Å. The composition 
of the F-substituted NdOBiS2 single crystal was Nd0.98±0.06O0.7±0.1F0.3±0.1Bi0.98±0.04S2. 
Tc
onset and Tc
zero for the single crystal were 5.5 and 5.0 K, respectively. The values of γs 
were determined to be 30 and 32.3 using the effective mass model and the upper critical 
field [Eq. (2)], respectively. The CsCl/KCl flux method is a powerful way to obtain 
chalcogenide single crystals.
