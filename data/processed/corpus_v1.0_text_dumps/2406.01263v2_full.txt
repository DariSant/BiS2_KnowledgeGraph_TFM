ABSTRACT
We examined the effect of Pb substitution in the layered superconductor LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2
(x = 0∼0.15) through the measurements of the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and
Seebeck coefficient. These transport and thermal properties show anomalies at certain temperatures
(T*) for x≥0.08. The large thermal expansion anomalies, specific heat anomalies, and the existence
of hystereses in the above measurements indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T*. Addi-
tionally, the Seebeck coefficient indicates that the anomalies at T* are related not only to the lattice
system, but also to the electronic system. Superconductivity is not observed above 2 K at x=0.08,
which is around the phase boundary where T* vanishes. The suppression of superconductivity around
the structural phase boundary suggests a close relationship between the lattice and superconductivity.

Introduction
Since the BiCh2-based (Ch: chalcogenide) superconductor Bi4O4S3 was discovered in 2012[1], various BiCh2-based
superconductors such as La(O, F)BiCh2 (Ch=S, Se) have been studied intensively [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. A
major feature of BiCh2 superconductors is absence of the isotope effect on the superconducting transition temperature
Tc ; the isotope exponent α defined by Tc ∼Mα (M : the isotope mass) was close to zero in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe
and Bi4O4S3, which is expected to be α ∼0.5 in conventional BCS superconductors [12, 13]. Another feature
is that in LaO1−xFxBiSSe and CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 crystals with tetragonal structure, c-axis magnetoresistance in the
superconducting state shows two-fold symmetry in in-plane anisotropy [14, 15, 16]. These results suggest that
BiCh2-based superconductors have an unconventional superconducting mechanism.
BiCh2-based superconductors La(O, F)BiCh2 have the layered structures comprising of block layers (LaO) and
conduction layers (BiCh2). By partially substituting F for O in the block layers, we can introduce electronic carriers into
the conduction layers, leading to the emergence of superconductivity [10]. Interestingly, Tc increases significantly by
applying pressure on the crystals. LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has Tc ∼2 K under ambient pressure [17]. By applying a pressure
of 1 GPa, Tc increases up to ∼10 K ,[18, 19] accompanied by a change from the tetragonal structure (P4/nmm) to a
monoclinic one (P21/m) . These results indicate that the crystal structure may be responsible for the increase in Tc
[20]. Additionally chemical pressure introduced instead of physical pressure, is also effective in increasing Tc [21].
Mizuguchi et al. reported that an in-plane chemical pressure suppresses in-plane disorders and enhances the lattice
anharmonicity, which is positively linked to Tc and the pairing mechanism[22].
Recently, studying the effect of chemical pressure on Pb-doped BiCh2 crystals has garnered significant attention, which
cannot be understood solely based on the in-plane chemical pressure effects. In NdO0.7F0.3Bi1−xPbxS2, the length of
the c-axis decreases monotonically with the Pb concentration (x) until x=0.06, and Tc increases up to 5.6 K for x=0.06
[23]. Moreover, in LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2, Tc exhibits a suppression between x=0.02 and 0.05 and an enhancement
above x=0.06. Interestingly, LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 shows an anomaly in the temperature dependence of the resistivity
at approximately 150 K above x=0.08 [24]. This anomaly was not observed in NdO0.7F0.3Bi1−xPbxS2. The origin of
this anomaly and its relation to the increase in Tc are still not clear.

In this study, we examined the effect of Pb-substitution on the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck
coefficient for LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x =0∼0.15) single crystals. We observed anomalies and hystereses at a certain
temperature, T*, above x=0.08 in all transport and thermal measurements, and conclude that these anomalies at T* are
due to the first-order structural phase transition. The superconductivity is suppressed at x=0.08 around the boundary
where T* vanishes.

Experiment
Single crystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x =0∼0.15) were synthesized with a flux method with KCl and
CsCl in a quartz tube. Powders of La2S3, Bi2O3, Bi2S3, PbF2, BiF3, and Bi were used as starting materials. The
molar ratio of the KCl and CsCl flux was KCl : CsCl= 3 : 5. The powders (2 g) and flux (15 g) were mixed and
vacuum-sealed in a quartz tube. The tube was heated up to 900 ◦C for 12 hours, maintained at 900 ◦C for 24 hours, and
then cooled down to 600 ◦C at a rate of 0.5 ◦C/h.
The resistivity was measured using PPMS (Physical Property Measurement System, Quantum Design) with the
conventional four-terminal method from 2 K to 300 K. The thermal expansion was measured using a self-made device
in the laboratory with the two-gauge method from 80 K to 300 K. The specific heat was measured using chopped-light
AC calorimetry (ADVANCE RIKO) from 85 K to 300 K. We also measured specific heat using PPMS from 0.38 K to
300 K. The Seebeck coefficient was measured from 4 K to 300 K using a device constructed in the laboratory.
Single crystal X-ray structural analysis was conducted using a Rigaku VariMax with Saturn at 293 K. The radiation
source was MoKα (λ = 0.71073 Å). Since O and F are not distinguishable by X-ray diffraction, F was not included
in the molecular model considered. Structural analysis was conducted with the Bi and Pb contents fixed. From
single crystal X-ray structural analysis, we obtained the space group of P4/nmm (#129) for all Pb concentrations.
The parameters R1, wR2, and goodness of fit indicator are 0.0396 to 0.0637, 0.0896 to 0.1494, and 1.146 to 1.287,
respectively. We examined the Pb concentration using an electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA). The obtained Pb
concentration increased linearly with the nominal Pb concentration; the net Pb concentration was 17 % higher than the
nominal Pb concentration. We use the nominal Pb concentration to indicate the crystals, and the net Pb concentration
was obtained as 1.17x, where x is the nominal concentration.

Results and Discussion
3.1
Crystal structure and F concentration
Figures 1 (a) and (b) show the dependences of lattice parameter a and c-axis on the Pb concentration at 293 K. The a and
c-axis increase with Pb concentration until x=0.14 and decrease above x=0.15. The increase in a and c can be ascribed
to the difference between the ionic radii of Pb2+ and Bi2.5∼3+; R (Pb2+) =1.19 Å [25], R (Bi3+) =1.03 Å[25], and R
(Bi2.5+) =1.0419 Å [21]. The lattice parameter a and c axis are a =4.0544(10) Å, c =13.4729(3) Å for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2,
respectively. The detailed dependence of the crystal structure on the Pb concentration will be discussed in another paper,
in which we will report that the crystal has monoclinic structure (P21/m) at room temperature above x=0.18.
In this study, O: F= 0.5: 0.5 in nominal composition; the F content cannot be determined precisely using X-ray analysis,
because there is negligible difference between the scattering factors of O and F. It was reported that the length of the
c-axis monotonously decreases with increasing y in LaO1−yFyBiS2[17, 26]. We estimated the net F concentration of
the crystals in this study by comparing our data with the c-axis length reported in Ref. 17, resulting in an F concentration
of ∼0.35. As shown in Ref. 17, the c-axis of the pure crystal increased by approximately 0.1 per 10 % F concentration.
In the present Pb-doped crystal, the c-axis increases slightly with x from x=0 to 0.14 by approximately 0.02 Å. We
exclude the relatively large change in the a and c-axes for x=0.15, because these changes occur near the phase boundary
discussed later and its origin seems to be different from the change in a and c-axis from x=0 to 0.14. Assuming that the
change in the c-axis is cased due to the F concentration only, the change in the F concentration is only 2 % between
x=0∼0.14. Then, we conclude the F concentrations of the present Pb-doped crystals is approximately 0.33∼0.37. The
length of the a and c-axes in the present Pb-doped crystals is different from those reported in Otsuki et al [24], which
may be ascribed to the difference in the F concentration.
3.2
Resistivity
Figures 2 (a)-(c) show the T-dependence of the resistivity (ρ) in the T range from 2 K to 300 K for
LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x= 0∼0.12). Fig.2 (a) shows ρ in the cooling process for x<0.08; ρ exhibits a semiconducting
behavior with the Pb concentration until x=0.06. These semiconducting behaviors are similar to that reported by Otsuki
2


et al [24]. For x=0∼0.07, ρ starts to decrease around 2∼3 K due to superconductivity. As shown in Fig. 2 (b), ρ
increases with decreasing T, and drops sharply at a certain temperature T*ER. The sharp change in ρ often appears
several times below T*ER. The ρ below T*ER shows a metallic behavior except for the low temperatures of T<30 K.
Such a change in ρ around T*ER has been reported by Otsuki et al [24]. For x=0.09 and 0.10, ρ started to drop due to
superconductivity at approximately 3 K. In this study, we evaluated T ERonset
c
from the temperature at which ρ starts to
decrease sharply, because zero resistance was not observed for all Pb concentrations.
For x=0.08, ρ shows a sharp peak at ∼10 K, although its origin is still not clear. Figure 2 (c) shows ρ in the heating
process; ρ shows a similar behavior to that in the cooling process, although T*ER in the heating process is approximately
15-32 K higher than that in the cooling process. This behavior of ρ indicates that the change in ρ at T*ER is accompanied
by hysteresis, suggesting a first-order phase transition.
3.3
Thermal expansion
Figures 3 (a)-(c) show the T-dependence of the linear expansion coefficient ∆L(T)/L in the T range from 85 K to
300 K for LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x=0.08∼0.14). Here, ∆L(T)/L was obtained by integrating the thermal expansion
coefficient, α, with respect to T. ∆L(T)/L at x=0.10 and 0.14 decreases with decreasing T at a nearly constant rate,
and drops sharply around T*ER. After the sharp drops, ∆L(T)/L decreases again with T. For x=0.10, the overall
T-dependence of ∆L(T)/L is similar to those of other crystals except for the anomaly, where ∆L(T)/L for x=0.10
shows a small peak. The anomaly of ∆L(T)/L shows hysteresis (Figure 3(b)). Insets of Figures 3 show the thermal
expansion coefficient, α, which shows a large peak corresponding to the sharp change of ∆L(T)/L originating from
the change in the lattice structure. We define T*T E as the peak temperature of α. The anomalies of ∆L(T)/L and α
accompanied by hysteresis indicate that the change in ρ at T*ER arises from the first-order phase transition of the lattice
system.
3.4
Specific heat
Figure 4 (a) shows the specific heat, C, of LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x=0.09) in the T range from 10 K to 300 K. Figure
4 (b) shows the C/T vs. T 2 plot for x=0.09 from 0.38 K to 5 K. In Fig. 4 (b), the dashed line represents the linear
fit of the data with C/T=γN + βT 2, where γN is the electronic specific heat coefficient and β is the coefficient of
the phonon cubic term. We obtained γN=1.25 mJ/mol·K2 and β=0.62 mJ/mol·K4 from the fitting. The transition
between the superconducting state and normal state at approximately T ∼3.5 K is not distinct. Inset of Fig. 4 (b) shows
the electronic specific heat, Ce, divided by T (Ce/T), which is obtained by subtracting the phonon contribution βT 2
from C/T (Ce/T =C/T-βT 2) under the assumption that the phonon terms in the normal state do not change in the
superconducting state. There is a hump at approximately 3 K in the inset of Fig. 4 (b); Ce/T starts to increase below 3.4
K(= T SHonset
c
) and decreases toward zero below ∼2 K. T SHonset
c
is close to T ERonset
c
, which is defined in terms of
the resistivity. Despite the broad superconducting transition, the low-temperature specific heat, Ce/T, approaches zero.
This behavior suggests zero residual γ; and specifically, the bulk nature of superconductivity for at least x=0.09.
Figures 5 (a) and (b) show the C in the T range from 80 K to 300 K for LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x=0.09 and 0.10). In
Figs. 5 (a) and (b), C is not the absolute value, but relative value in arbitrary units, because the values were measured by
AC calorimetry. The C values for x=0.09 and 0.10 slowly decrease with decreasing T and drop sharply at T*SH. The
anomalies in C for x=0.09 and 0.10 show hystereses as well as ρ and ∆L(T)/L, indicating a first-order phase transition.
Here, we focus on the magnitude of the anomaly in C, ∆C. ∆C/T for x=0.09 and 0.10 is 25 and 109 mJ/mol·K2,
which are estimated from the comparison of the C data measured by PPMS and AC calorimetry. The ∆C/T values are
significantly higher than the γN value of 1.25 mJ/mol·K2. This implies that the contribution of the electronic system to
∆C is small, and the transition at T*SH is mostly caused by the lattice system.
3.5
Seebeck coefficient
Figures 6 (a)-(c) show the T-dependence of the Seebeck coefficient S in the T range from 4 K to 300 K for
LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x = 0∼0.10). For x=0, S shows a T-linear dependence above ∼200 K and significantly
increases below ∼200 K. S has a broad peak at ∼30 K and decreases toward zero at lower temperatures. For x=0.02
and 0.04, S increases significantly below ∼210 K and ∼240 K and shows a peak around ∼30 K. These behaviors of S
observed for x=0.02 and 0.04 are similar to those of x=0. For x=0.07 and 0.08; S increases below ∼240 K and ∼230
K, but the enhancement becomes smaller than that for x=0.04. S for x=0.08 changes sign below ∼10 K, which may be
related to the sharp peak of ρ.
The temperature (Tp) where S starts to deviate from T-linear dependence at high temperatures is close to the Debye
temperature determined by phonon specific heat coefficient β [27], as shown in the inset of Fig. 6 (b). The significant
3


enhancement of S below Tp can be ascribed to a positive phonon-drag effect. The large positive phonon-drag effects
for x≤0.08 indicate strong phonon-electron interactions and strong Umkrapp scattering enhanced by Pb substitution.
For x=0.09 and 0.10, S is approximately constant at high temperatures (T>170 K for x=0.09 and 250 K for x=0.10)
and shows a step-like anomaly at T*Seebeck, which is approximately 160 K and 200 K for x=0.09 and 0.10, respectively.
S is approximately proportional to T below ∼100 K. Interestingly, the positive phonon-drag enhancement in S was
not observed for x=0.09 and 0.10. Instead, S for x=0.09 and 0.10 shows a weak negative phonon-drag effect at low
temperatures of 10-30 K. This result means that the nature of the phonon-electron interactions changes below and above
x=0.08.
The Seebeck coefficient is generally not much affected by structural phase transitions. It seems that the anomalies at T*
are related not only to the lattice system, but also to the electronic system. From first-principle band structure calculations,
Kuroki et al. reported that the phase transition from the tetragonal to monoclinic structure for LaO1−yFyBiS2 under
high pressure causes a band splitting, which leads to a decrease in the electronic energy in monoclinic structure [28].
The Seebeck coefficient anomalies could be ascribed to a band splitting in the electronic system due to the structural
phase transition from the tetragonal to monoclinic structures.
3.6
Pb dependences of Tc and T*
Figure 7 shows the Pb dependence of T*, obtained by the various measurements in LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x=0∼0.15).
T onset
c
obtained from the resistivity and specific heat are also plotted together with T* in Fig. 7. T ERonset
c
approximately
agrees with T SHonset
c
at least for x=0 and 0.09 [27]. T ERonset
c
is nearly independent of the Pb concentration except
for that at x=0.08; there is no sign of superconductivity at x=0.08 at least above ∼2 K. It should be noted that the
suppression of Tc at x=0.08 is in contrast to the results reported by Otsuki et al; this may be due to the slight difference
in the F concentration, as described previously in Section 2. Moreover, the measured T*ER in this study is consistent
with data reported by Otsuki et al. T* seems to be independent of the F concentration, that is, the electronic doping
level.
As shown in Fig. 7, T* appears around x=0.08 and increases linearly with the Pb concentration. The dependences
of T* on the Pb concentration measured by various probes are similar to each other. The specific heat anomaly and
existence of hystereses in the measurements indicate the first-order phase transition at T*, as described before. Here,
we define the Low-T phase as the temperature region below T* and High-T phase as the temperature region above T*.
At x=0.08, which is just the boundary between High-T and Low-T phases, superconductivity is not observed above 2
K. In other words, superconductivity is suppressed near the phase boundary. The large anomaly in thermal expansion
suggests some type of structural phase transition from the tetragonal to another structure at T*. The suppression of
superconductivity at the structural phase boundary suggests the close relationship between the lattice structure and
superconductivity.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have measured the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient in a single
crystal of LaO0.5F0.5Bi1−xPbxS2 (x=0∼0.15). The dependences of T* on the Pb concentration measured by various
probes are similar to each other. The large anomaly of thermal expansion, shape of the specific heat anomaly, and the
existence of hystereses indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T* from the tetragonal symmetry (P4/nmm).
The suppression of Tc at x=0.08 near the phase boundary suggests the close relationship between the lattice structure
and superconductivity.
