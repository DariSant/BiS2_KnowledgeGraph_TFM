Abstract
Using the density-functional perturbation theory with structural optimization, we investigate
the electronic structure, phonon spectra, and superconductivity of BiS2-based layered compounds
LaO1−xFxBiS2. For LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, the calculated electron-phonon coupling constant is equal to
λ = 0.8, and obtained Tc ≃9.1 K is very close to its experimental value, indicating that it is a
conventional electron-phonon superconductor.

The recent discovery of superconductivity in the BiS2-based compounds has attracted
much attention due to their layered crystal structure and physical properties similar to
cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. The Bi4O4S3 superconductor was found to exhibit
metallic transport behavior and to show a zero-resistivity state below 4.5 K.1 Soon after, an-
other type of BiS2-based systems, ReO1−xFxBiS2 (Re = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd), were reported
to be superconducting with transition temperatures Tc equal to 10.6, 3.0, 5.5, and 5.6 K,
respectively.2–5 For Bi4O4S3 (ReO1−xFxBiS2), superconductivity can be obtained by elec-
trons doping into the insulating parent compound Bi6O8S5 (ReOBiS2). Experimental and
theoretical studies indicated that these materials exhibit multiband behavior with dominant
electron carriers originating mainly from the Bi 6p orbitals.1,6–12
In this Letter we report the calculated results for the electronic structure of LaO1−xFxBiS2
(x = 0, 0.5, and 1), phonon dispersions and electron-phonon coupling of superconducting
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. From the ﬁrst-principles calculation, it is shown that the parent compound
LaOBiS2 is a band insulator with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV , similar to the ground state of
cuprate and pnictide superconductors. Upon F doping, the Fermi level moves up and the
system appears a metallic nature. We obtain electron-phonon coupling constant λ = 0.8 and
superconducting transition temperature Tc ≃9.1 K in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, indicating that this
compound can be explained as a conventional phonon-mediated superconductor, quite diﬀer-
ent from the Fe-based materials13,14 but somewhat similar to the Ni-based compounds.15,16
We used the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave method implemented in the
WIEN2K package17 for the lattice parameter optimization and electronic structure calcula-
tions. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) presented by Wu and Cohen18 was
used for the exchange-correlation energy calculations. This GGA is a nonempirical approx-
imation that gives signiﬁcant improvements of calculations for lattice constants and crystal
structures. The phonon dispersion and the electron-phonon coupling are calculated using
density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). The phonon dispersions were obtained in
linear response via the QUANTUM-ESPRESSO program19 and ultrasoft pseudopotentials.
The GGA of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof20 was adopted for the exchange-correlation potentials
with a cutoﬀof 60 Ry for the wave functions and 600 Ry for the charge density.
LaO1−xFxBiS2 with x=0 or 1 is crystallized in the ZrCuSiAs type tetragonal structure
(P4/nmm) with La, Bi, S1 in the Bi planes, S2 in between Bi-S1 and La-O(F) planes, and

and 2a(0, 0, 0), respectively. The F substitution at the O sites in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 reduces
the symmetry to a space group of P-4m2. Starting from the lattice parameters (a = 4.0527
˚A and c = 13.3237 ˚A) reported by Mizuguchi et al.2, we have performed the full structural
optimization including the lattice parameters and atomic positions, the obtained results
being summarized in Table I. It is found that, with doping F from x = 0 to x = 1, the a
value increases gradually but the c value decreases, accompanied with a decrease of primitive
cell volume V . By making a comparison in the atomic bond length between LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and LaOBiS2, one ﬁnds that the Bi-S2 bond expands due to F doping while dBi−S1 for the
Bi-S1 bond remains almost unchanged.
The calculated band structures and electronic density of states (DOS) are shown in Fig.
1. The contribution of orbital states to the band structure are characterized by diﬀerent
colors: blue (Bi-p), red (S1-p), and green (O-p and S2-p). For LaOBiS2, the Fermi level
is located at the upper edge of valence bands with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV, indicating
an insulating behavior. The valance bands spread from around −6 eV to 0 and consist of
the p states of the O and S atoms. While the La-d and La-f states lie above 4 eV, far
away from the Fermi level, the Bi-p and S1-p states dominate the conduction bands. For
doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, the Fermi level enters the conduction bands coming from the Bi-p

and S1-p states, so that the Bi-S1 layers dominantly contribute to the electronic conduction.
As shown in Fig. 1b, the present Fermi level crosses four bands of electron pockets, and
so LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has electron carriers, which is well consistent with the Hall resistance
measurements.10 The DOS at the Fermi level is equal to N(EF) = 1.22 eV−1 on a per
formula unit both spins basis, and the corresponding bare susceptibility and speciﬁc heat
coeﬃcient are given by χ0 = 4.0×10−5 emu/mol and γ0 = 3.0 mJ/mol K2, respectively. For
LaFBiS2, the Fermi level further enters the conduction bands and the energy gap increases
to ∼1.1 eV. Meanwhile, the DOS at the Fermi level increases to N(EF) = 1.84 eV−1 per
formula unit both spins, yielding χ0 = 6.0 × 10−5 emu/mol and γ0 = 4.5 mJ/mol K2.
The calculated phonon dispersions of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are plotted in Fig. 2a, in which
there are 30 phonon bands extending up to ∼450 cm−1 and the point group at the Γ and
M points is D2d. The Γ and M-point modes can be decomposed as Γ = 6B2
L 10E L 4A1
and M = 4B1
L 4A1
L 5B2
L 5A2
L 6E. Note that the E mode is degenerate, and its
frequencies are listed in Table II. The Raman modes at the zone center can be measured
directly by experiments in near future. The corresponding phonon density of states (PDOS),
Eliashberg spectral function α2F(ω), electron-phonon coupling λ(ω) and projected PDOS

are shown in Fig. 3. There are three distinct peaks centered at ∼70 cm−1 (A1 mode at Γ
point), ∼190 cm−1 (E mode at Γ point), and ∼250 cm−1 (B2 mode at Γ point), respectively,
corresponding to three thick lines from lower to upper in Fig. 2a. As shown in Fig. 2b, the A1
mode corresponds to the vertical vibrations with the upper and lower BiS2-layers (La-layers)
beating against each other. The E mode corresponds to the in-plane stretching vibrations
with motion along the x(y) axis. In the B2 mode, the La, Bi, and S1 atoms vibrate along the
same z direction, opposite to the vibration direction of the S2, O, and F atoms. From Fig.
3, one can see that the bands around 70 cm−1 comes mainly from the PDOS contributions
of the Bi and La motion, the peak at 190 cm−1 mainly corresponds to the S character, and
that at 250 cm−1 corresponds to F, O and S character. The calculated Eliashberg spectral
function has peaks in consistent with the PDOS at the low-frequency regime, and is evidently
enhanced in the intermediate frequency regime. In the DFPT calculations, the Eliashberg
spectral function depends directly on the electron-phonon matrix element:

×δ(εnk)δ(εm(k+q))δ(ω −ωqν).

Here, Nk is the number of k points used in the summation, N(EF) is the density of states at
the Fermi level, and ωgν are the phonon frequencies. The electron-phonon matrix element |
gν
nk,m(k+q) |2 is deﬁned by the variation in the self-consistent crystal potential. It follows that
the electron-phonon interaction of Bi-S1 bond plays an important role in the enhancement of
α2F(ω). From the λ(ω) curves in Fig. 3a, where λ(ω) = 2
R ω
0 [α2F(Ω)/Ω]dΩ, one ﬁnds that
λ(220) ≃0.7 has been close to λ(∞) ≃0.8, indicating that the phonon modes in the low and
intermediate frequency regimes have the main contribution to the electron-phonon coupling.
From the α2F(ω) spectra in Fig. 3, we get the electron-phonon coupling λ = 0.8 and the
logarithmically averaged frequency ωln =192 K. Using further the Allen-Dynes formula with
the Coulomb parameter µ∗= 0.1, we ﬁnally obtain Tc = 9.1 K, which is found very close to
the experimental value Tc = 10.6 K.2 It then follows that the doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is very
likely a conventional electron-phonon superconductor.
In summary, the present ﬁrst-principles calculations indicate that LaO1−xFxBiS2 changes
from a band insulator at x = 0 to a band metal upon doping. Similar to LaFeAsO1−xFx,
electrons in LaO1−xFxBiS2 are doped from the LaO(F) redox layer to the superconducting
BiS2 layers.
The p-orbital states of Bi-S1 layers play an important role in the electron
5


transformation due to their domination of the DOS at the Fermi level. From the phonon
calculations for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we obtain a strong electron-phonon coupling of λ = 0.8 and
a superconducting transition temperature of Tc = 9.1 K, the latter being very close to its
experimental value. It then follows that LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a conventional electron-phonon
superconductor.
For LaO1−xFxBiS2, we have shown that the electronic states near the Fermi level are dom-
inantly from the hybridized p orbital states of the Bi and S1 atoms, and the electron-phonon
coupling comes mainly from the contribution of the Bi and S phonons. These facts indicate
that the BiS2 layers play an important role in the transport and superconducting properties,
similar to the CuO2 layers of the cuprates or Fe-As layers of the Fe-based superconductors.
