Abstract 
Resistivities of single-crystalline as well as poly-crystalline samples of CeOBiS2 
without fluorine doping were measured at temperatures down to 0.13 K, and were 
compared with those of poly-crystalline LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2. Both poly-crystalline 
and single-crystalline CeOBiS2 exhibited zero resistivity below 1.2 K while 
poly-crystalline LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2 did not show zero resistivity down to 0.13 K. 
Superconducting transition temperature of CeOBiS2 was reduced by increasing the 
applied current density. The superconductivity of CeOBiS2 without chemical doping is 
likely triggered by the carriers induced by the valence fluctuation between Ce3+ and 
Ce4+.

1. Introduction 
Chemical doping of semiconductors is a method used to induce superconductivity in 
them. The superconductivity of diamond [1,2], Si [3], and SiC [4-6] is induced by 
introducing carriers through chemical doping. R(O,F)BiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) 
[7-11] are layered semiconductors with a band gap of around 1 eV [12], and 
superconductivity is induced in them through electron carrier doping by substituting 
oxygen (O) with fluorine (F). This doping induces electron carriers into the BiS2 
superconducting layer. Recently, it was discovered that the fluctuation of Eu valence 
between Eu2+ and Eu3+ induces carriers and produces superconductivity in EuFBiS2 and 
Eu3Bi2S4F4 without chemical doping [13,14]. Thus, Eu-based compounds are examples 
in which superconductivity is induced by the fluctuation of valence. As suggested in Ref. 
15 and 16, for R = Ce, the Ce valence in CeOBiS2 also fluctuates between Ce3+ and Ce4+. 
However, its zero resistivity has not been reported at a temperature down to 1.8 K in 
F-free CeOBiS2. This motivated us to examine superconductivity in non-chemically 
doped CeOBiS2 to investigate whether a valence fluctuation can induce

superconductivity in general. In this paper, we measured the temperature dependence of 
electrical resistivity for chemically non-doped ROBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr) poly crystals 
and CeOBiS2 single crystals down to 0.13 K using an adiabatic demagnetization 
refrigerator (ADR). In contrast to LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2, only CeOBiS2 showed 
superconducting transition below 1.2 K, indicating that the valence fluctuation of Ce 
induces superconductivity.  
 
2. Experimental 
Poly-crystalline samples of ROBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr) were synthesized by a solid state 
reaction in a vacuumed quartz tube using R2S3 (99.9 wt%), Bi2S3 (99.9 wt%), and Bi2O3 
(99.9 wt%) as raw materials. The raw materials were mixed in a nominal composition of 
ROBiS2 using a mortar, and sealed into a quartz tube in vacuum (~10 Pa). Then, the 
sample was heated at 700 °C for 10 h. The calcined mixture was ground to homogenize 
it and pressed into a pellet of 10 mm diameter and about 1-2 mm thickness, and then 
sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum (~10 Pa). This pellet in the quartz tube was heated 
at 700 °C for 20 h, and then furnace-cooled to room temperature. The quartz tube was 
opened in air. Poly-crystalline samples of ROBiS2 were obtained as products.  
Single crystals of CeOBiS2 were grown by the CsCl flux method in a vacuumed quartz 


 
5
tube using Ce2S3 (99.9 wt%), Bi2S3 (99.9 wt%), Bi2O3 (99.9 wt%), and CsCl (99.8 wt%) 
as raw materials [17-20]. The raw materials were weighed to obtain the nominal 
composition of CeOBiS2. A mixture of these raw materials (0.8 g) and CsCl flux (5.0 g) 
was combined using a mortar, and then sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum (~10 Pa). 
This mixed powder in the quartz tube was heated at 950 °C for 10 h, cooled slowly to 
650 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, and then furnace-cooled to room temperature. The quartz 
tube was opened in air, and the flux was dissolved in the quartz tube using distilled 
water. The product obtained was filtered and washed with distilled water.  
The crystal structures of the poly-crystalline and single-crystalline products were 
evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis using CuKα radiation. The 
resistivity–temperature 
(ρ–T) 
characteristics 
of 
these 
poly-crystalline 
and 
single-crystalline samples were measured by the standard four-probe method at a 
constant current density (J) using an ADR option for quantum design physical property 
measurement system (PPMS). The magnetic field applied for operating the ADR was 3 
T at 1.9 K; subsequently, it was removed. Consequently, the temperature of sample 
decreased to around 0.13 K. The measurement of ρ–T characteristics was started at the 
lowest temperature (around 0.13 K), which was spontaneously increased to around 15 K. 
The ρ–T characteristics were measured while the temperature was increased. The 


 
6
dependence of applied current density on the ρ–T characteristics was also observed. The 
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) was estimated from the ρ–T characteristics. 
The transition temperature corresponding to the onset of superconductivity (Tc
onset) is 
defined as the temperature at which deviation from linear behavior is observed in the 
normal conducting state in the ρ–T characteristics. The zero resistivity (Tc
zero) is 
determined as the temperature at which resistivity is below 5 μΩ cm. ρ–T characteristics 
under a magnetic field (H) range of 0-0.3 T parallel to the ab-plane and the c-axis of 
CeOBiS2 single crystal were measured without ADR option in the temperature range of 
2.0-5.0 K.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns of ROBiS2 poly-crystalline samples where (a) R = La, 
(b) R = Ce, and (c) R = Pr. The major diffraction peaks of the obtained poly-crystalline 
samples were indexed as ROBiS2 phases. Figure 2 shows the ρ–T characteristics of 
ROBiS2 poly-crystalline samples in the temperature range of 0.13-15 K. LaOBiS2 and 
PrOBiS2 poly-crystalline samples did not exhibit zero resistivity down to around 0.13 K. 
In contrast, for R = Ce, the resistivity drops in the range 1.3-1.9 K; the Tc
onset and Tc
zero 
were estimated to be 1.9 K and 1.3 K, respectively. The transport properties of the 


 
7
ROBiS2 poly-crystalline samples exhibited semiconducting behavior. LaOBiS2 showed 
a significantly higher resistivity compared to CeOBiS2 and PrOBiS2. The resistivity of 
PrOBiS2 was lower than that of CeOBiS2 at the normal state. However, superconducting 
transition was not observed in PrOBiS2 down to 0.13 K.  
Figure 3 shows the XRD pattern of a well-developed plane of CeOBiS2 single crystal. 
The presence of only 00l diffraction peaks of the CeOBiS2 structure indicates that the 
ab-plane is well developed. Four terminals for the ρ–T characteristics measurement 
were fabricated on the well-developed plane using silver paste. In consequence, the 
applied current was along the ab-plane. The ρ–T characteristics of the CeOBiS2 single 
crystal sample were measured in the temperature range of 0.13-15 K. Figure 4 shows 
the applied current density dependence of ρ–T characteristics for a CeOBiS2 single 
crystal. Superconducting transition was observed in the CeOBiS2 single crystal, and the 
superconducting transition temperature was reduced by increasing the applied current 
density (J). The Tc
zero was not observed down to 0.13 K, when J was more than 6.33 
A/cm2. For J = 1.05 A/cm2, the Tc
onset and Tc
zero were estimated to be 3.1 K and 1.2 K, 
respectively. Similar Tc
zero found in poly-crystalline and single-crystalline samples 
suggests that CeOBiS2 without intentional doping displays superconductivity below 1.2 
K. Nonetheless, there are minor differences in transition temperatures between 


 
8
poly-crystalline and single-crystalline samples. The Tc
zero of single-crystal sample (1.2 
K) was slightly lower than that of the poly-crystalline sample (1.3 K) because of the 
high applied current density associated with the smaller cross-section area of a single 
crystal. The Tc
onset and ΔTc (Tc
onset - Tc
zero) of single-crystalline sample increased in 
comparison with the poly-crystalline sample. We cannot deny the possibility of 
contamination by F detected in the CsCl flux, because the fluorine content in CsCl was 
determined to be 0.11 mol% by ion chromatography analysis. Nonetheless, F detection 
in CeOBiS2 single crystals was very difficult by spectroscopic analysis. For 
spectroscopic analysis such as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), F-Kα (677 eV) 
characteristic X-ray is overlapped with Ce-Mζ (676 eV) characteristic X-ray [21]. On 
the other hand, for ion chromatography analysis, dissolution of the CeOBiS2 single 
crystals into a solution was found to be difficult.  
The ρ–T characteristics for the CeOBiS2 single crystal in the range of 2.0-5.0 K under 
a magnetic field (H) range of 0-0.3 T parallel to the ab-plane and c-axis using PPMS 
without ADR option are shown in Figure 5. The resistivity dropped at around 3.5 K by 
the self-field (H = 0 T), and the temperature at which resistivity dropped decreased with 
the increase in magnetic field (H). This result is evidence that superconducting 
transition (Tc
onset) occurs at around 3.5 K. This Tc
onset is higher than that measured using 


 
9
ADR option (3.1 K). This phenomenon may be explained as follows: the measurement 
of Tc
onset without ADR option was performed in zero field cooling; on the other hand, 
the measurement with ADR option was performed with field cooling. The decrease in 
Tc
onset under the magnetic field applied parallel to the c-axis is more significant than that 
of the ab-plane, which corresponds to F-doped CeOBiS2 single crystals [20].  
In both poly-crystalline and single-crystalline samples, CeOBiS2 shows zero resistivity 
below 1.2 K. We assumed that the carrier for initiating superconductivity in CeOBiS2 
originated from the valence fluctuations between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states [22]. This is 
further supported by the absence of superconducting transition down to 0.13 K in 
LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2. The valence of La is probably La3+ in LaOBiS2. In the case of 
PrOBiS2, it was observed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and 
magnetization-temperature (M-T) characterization that valence fluctuations between 
Pr3+ and Pr4+ states hardly exist [23]. Therefore, the multivalence state of Ce3+ and Ce4+ 
induced superconductivity in CeOBiS2 without chemically doping it.  
 
4. Conclusion 
The superconductivity of CeOBiS2 without fluorine doping was examined down to 
0.13 K. Poly-crystalline CeOBiS2 showed zero resistivity below 1.3 K while LaOBiS2 


 
10
and PrOBiS2 poly-crystalline samples did not show superconductivity down to 0.13 K. 
The superconductivity of the CeOBiS2 single crystal was also observed at around 1.2 K, 
and it was similar to that found in the poly-crystalline sample. Therefore, the valence 
fluctuations between Ce3+ and Ce4+ states can induce superconducting transition without 
chemical doping, showing the potential of such valence fluctuations for exploring new 
superconductors.
