Abstract 
We examined the crystal structure of the new thermoelectric material 
LaOBiS2−xSex, whose thermoelectric performance is enhanced by Se substitution, by 
using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement. The emergence 
of metallic conductivity and enhancement of the thermoelectric power factor of 
LaOBiS2−xSex can be explained with the higher in-plane chemical pressure caused 
by the increase of Se concentration at the in-plane Ch1 site (Ch = S, Se). High-
temperature X-ray diffraction measurements for optimally substituted LaOBiSSe 
revealed anomalously large atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for Bi and Ch 
atoms in the BiCh2 conduction layers. The anisotropic analysis of the atomic 
displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites suggested 
that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic displacement along the c-axis direction above 300 
K, which could be the origin of the low thermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. The large 
Bi vibration along the c-axis direction could be related to in-plane rattling, which is 
a new strategy for attaining low thermal conductivity and phonon-glass-electron-
crystal states.

1. Introduction 
Layered bismuth chalcogenides (BiCh2-based; Ch = S, Se) have been 
drawing considerable attention in the community of condensed matter physics 
and chemistry because of the superconductivity discovered in several BiCh2-
based compounds, such as Bi4O4S3 and REO1−xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth).1,2 The 
typical crystal structure of BiCh2-based materials, which is similar to those of 
Cu-based or Fe-based high-Tc superconductors,3,4 is composed of alternate 
stacks of the BiCh2 conduction layer and the electrically insulating blocking 
layer.5 One of the advantages of layered structures is their great flexibility in 
designing new materials. The replacement of conduction and blocking layers 
enables to create new materials, which sometimes results in the discovery of 
new functionality. Consequently, layered bismuth chalcogenides are 
promising candidate materials to investigate novel phenomena such as 
possible unconventional superconductivity,6–9 tunable Rashba-type spin 
splitting,10,11 giant birefringence,12 tunable Dirac cone,13 or high thermoelectric 
performance.14–17 
 
Recently, we reported promising thermoelectric properties in 
LaOBiS2−xSex polycrystalline samples. The dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) 
for x = 0.8 exhibited a value of ZT = 0.17 at 723 K.15 Z is calculated from the 
equation Z = S2/, where S, , and  are the Seebeck coefficient, electrical 
resistivity, and thermal conductivity, respectively. Furthermore, high ZT 
exceeding 0.36 (at ~650 K), which was recently observed in a densified (hot-
pressed) sample of LaOBiSSe,18 was achieved by enhanced metallic 
conductivity, large absolute Seebeck coefficient, and low thermal conductivity.

However, the origins of the LaOBiS2−xSex thermoelectric properties have not 
been clarified from the crystal structure viewpoint. In this study, we 
investigated the LaOBiS2−xSex crystal structure by using powder synchrotron 
X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement to discuss the role of Se substitution 
in enhancing the thermoelectric performance. Furthermore, we show the 
temperature evolution of the crystal structure and atomic displacement 
parameters of optimally substituted LaOBiSSe at high temperature to discuss 
the origin of the low thermal conductivity. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
Polycrystalline samples of LaOBiS2−xSex (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1) 
were prepared using the solid-state-reaction method as described in Ref. 15. 
To investigate the crystal structure of these samples, powder synchrotron X-
ray diffraction measurements were performed at room temperature (RT ~ 293 
K) at the BL02B2 experimental station of SPring-8 (JASRI; Proposal No. 
2014B1003 and 2014B1071). We used imaging plate of a two-dimensional 
detector. The interval of data points was 0.1 deg. We performed high-
temperature X-ray diffraction on LaOBiSSe at RT, 300, 373, 473, 573, and 673 
K (JASRI; Proposal No. 2015A1441). In the high-temperature measurements, 
we used a LaOBiSSe sample densified using a hot-press instrument, as we 
recently observed high thermoelectric performance in hot-pressed (HP) 
LaOBiSSe samples (denoted as HP-LaOiSSe).18 The wavelength of the 
radiation beam for the measurements of as-grown LaOBiS2−xSex samples was 


5 
 
0.49542(4) Å, while that used for the high-temperature measurements of 
LaOBiSSe was 0.49575(8) Å. We performed Rietveld refinement (RIETAN-
FP19) using a typical structure model for REOBiCh2-type materials with a 
tetragonal space group of P4/nmm (see Fig. 1a).2 The crystal structure images 
were drawn using VESTA.20 
 
3. Results and discussion 
3-1. Evolution of crystal structure in LaOBiS2−xSex 
To investigate phase purity and crystal structure of the obtained 
LaOBiS2−xSex samples, we performed synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Almost no 
impurity peaks were detected for x = 0.2–1, and the structure was refined 
using a single-phase analysis with the tetragonal P4/nmm model, as shown in 
Fig. S1. The structure for x = 0 was reported in our previous paper.21 The 
structure parameters obtained by Rietveld analysis for LaOBiS2−xSex are 
summarized in the Supplementary Material (Table S1).  
Here, we define two different chalcogen sites, Ch1 and Ch2 sites, as 
depicted in Fig. 1a. Fig. 1b shows the nominal x dependence of the refined Se 
concentration at the in-plane Ch1 and out-of-plane Ch2 sites. Noticeably, Se 
selectively occupies the Ch1 site. In previous studies, similar site selectivity 
was observed in F-doped La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)2.22,23 Fig. 1c–e shows the nominal x 
dependences of the structure parameters: (c) a lattice constant, (d) c lattice 
constant, and (e) Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle. By increasing x, both the a and c lattice 
constants monotonously increase because of the lattice expansion, which can 


6 
 
be understood by considering the difference in the ionic radius of Se2− (1.98 Å) 
and S2− (1.84 Å). The Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle, which represents the flatness of the 
BiCh1 plane, decreases with increasing x, suggesting that the Se substitution 
results in in-plane (static) disorder. This tendency is similar to the structure 
evolution of the Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex superconductors.22 Fig. 1f–
h shows three different Bi-Ch distances. The inter-plane Bi-Ch1 distance (Fig. 
1f) assumes the lowest value at x = 0.2 and increases by increasing x up to 1. 
The in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance (Fig. 1g) monotonously increases with increasing 
x. The Bi-Ch2 distance (Fig. 1h) decreases by increasing x up to 0.6, and it 
increases for higher values of x.  
In LaOBiS2−xSex, the power factor (S2/) is largely enhanced by Se 
substitution.15,18 When x increases,  decreases without large degradation of S, 
implying that the Se substitution does not largely affect the electron carrier 
concentrations, but it enhances the carrier mobility; the study on Hall 
measurements for LaOBiS2−xSex will appear in other article. To relate the 
evolutions of in-plane structure and physical properties, we use the concept 
proposed in the structurally similar La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)2 superconductor family.22 
The increase in Se occupancy in the BiCh1 plane enhances the in-plane 
chemical pressure (CP), and metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity 
are induced by the enhanced in-plane CP.22 This can be explained by the 
enhancement of orbital overlap of between Bi-6p and Ch-p orbitals. The 
different energy level of the Se and S p orbitals can also affect the properties. 
We assume that the substitution of Se into Ch1 sites decreases the band gaps 
of LaOBiSSe, as the valence band top and the conduction band bottom are 


7 
 
formed by Bi-Ch1 orbitals.6,21 On the basis of this scenario, the increase in Se 
occupancy at the in-plane Ch1 site should be related to the emergence of 
metallic conductivity and the enhancement of the power factor in the present 
LaOBiS2-xSex system. However, it is quite difficult to directly discuss the 
obtained structure parameters and the magnitude of CP because the Bi-Ch1 
distance increases with the Se concentration. Therefore, we use the equation, 
CP = [RBi + <RCh1>]/[Bi-Ch1]obs, as demonstrated in Ref. 22. In the equation, 
RBi is the ionic radius of Bi3+ (equal to 1.03 Å, assuming a coordination number 
of 6); <RCh1> is the average value of the ionic radius of Ch2− at the Ch1 site (the 
ionic radii of S2− and Se2− are 1.84 and 1.98 Å, respectively, assuming a 
coordination number of 6; in calculating <RCh1>, the Se occupancy at the Ch1 
site, Fig. 1b, is used); [Bi-Ch1]obs is the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance (Fig. 1g). The 
in-plane CP of LaOBiS2−xSex, which is plotted as a function of x in Fig. 2a, is 
clearly enhanced by increasing the value of x. In addition, to relate the 
enhanced in-plane CP to the evolution of the metallic conductivity,  at RT for 
LaOBiS2−xSex was plotted as a function of the calculated in-plane CP (Fig. 
2b).15 The value of (RT) largely decreases with increasing x up to x = 0.4, 
whereas low  values are observed for x ≥ 0.4. Therefore, the emergence of the 
metallic conductivity and the enhancement of the power factor may be related 
to the enhancement of the in-plane CP. To understand the physical properties 
of this system, the Se substitution appears to be more critical than the effect 
of the Bi-Ch1 distance elongation. Hence, tuning the in-plane CP and energy 
levels would be a useful strategy to design BiCh2-based materials with new 
functionality.

3-2. Crystal structure of LaOBiSSe at high temperatures 
Recently, we observed a high ZT value of 0.36 at 650 K in HP-
LaOBiSSe.18 Particularly, low thermal conductivity is essential to obtain high 
ZT values in LaOBiSSe. Here, we show the temperature evolution of the 
crystal structure and the atomic displacements of HP-LaOBiSSe (hot-pressed 
sample) at high temperatures, and discuss the relationship between low 
thermal conductivity and crystal structure. Fig. 3a–c shows the temperature 
dependences of the crystal structural parameters: (a) a lattice constant, (b) c 
lattice constant, and (c) Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle. By increasing the temperature, the 
a-axis linearly expands. The c-axis, however, shows a non-linear expansion. 
The c lattice constant does not show a noticeable expansion below 473 K, but 
it expands above 473 K. The Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle also shows a non-linear change: 
it increases with increasing the temperature up to 473 K, and almost saturates 
above this temperature. This trend indicates that the BiCh1 plane becomes 
flatter with increasing the temperature, although the change is not significant. 
Fig. 3d–f shows the temperature evolution of three different Bi-Ch distances: 
(d) inter-plane Bi-Ch1, (e) in-plane Bi-Ch1, and (f) Bi-Ch2 distances. The inter-
plane Bi-Ch1 and in-plane Bi-Ch1 distances monotonously increase with 
increasing temperature. The Bi-Ch2 distance slightly decreases with the 
temperature up to 473 K, but it starts increasing above this value; this 
behavior should be related to the non-linear expansion of the c-axis.

In Fig. 4, the isotropic atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for the 
La, Bi, Ch1, and Ch2 sites are plotted as a function of the temperature. To 
help the discussion of the characteristics of the atomic displacements of 
LaOBiSSe, we added eye-guide curves to the Uiso temperature dependence 
plots. For Ch2, a kink is observed at ~473 K; note that the temperature 
dependence of the resistivity of LaOBiSSe also exhibits an anomaly at around 
this temperature.18 This anomaly is related to the non-linear thermal 
expansion along the c-axis. We note that the Uiso values of Bi, Ch1, and Ch2 
are significantly large, compared with that observed for La. The large atomic 
displacements in the conduction layer are a general property of the BiCh2-
based family.22,24–26 In general, Uiso approaches zero at 0 K by extrapolating its 
temperature dependence. In the case of anharmonic lattice vibrations, for 
example with rattling atoms in a cage structure, Uiso does not approach zero 
and shows a finite large U value at 0 K; a similar analysis is reported in Ref. 
27. For the La site, the extrapolation of the temperature dependence of Uiso 
roughly approaches zero at 0 K. In contrast, the extrapolation of the 
temperature dependence of Uiso for the Bi, Ch1, and Ch2 sites does not reach 
zero at 0 K, which indicates the possibility of unusual atomic vibrations of the 
Bi and Ch atoms. Particularly, the in-plane Bi and Ch1 atoms exhibit large 
Uiso values. To discuss the characteristics of the atomic displacements for the 
Bi and Ch1 sites, we performed a Rietveld analysis with anisotropic 
displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites. 
The anisotropic Rietveld analysis (Table S2) resulted in a lower Rwp 
factor: for example, for the analysis of the 673 K diffraction data, the Rwp value 


10 
 
slightly decreased from 5.5% (isotropic analysis) to 5.4% (anisotropic analysis). 
The refined U11 and U33 for the Bi and Ch1 sites are plotted in Fig. 5a and b 
as functions of the temperature. In addition, to visualize the anisotropic 
atomic displacements at 300 and 673 K, schematic images of the crystal 
structure of the BiCh2 conduction layer—depicted using U11 and U33 for the Bi 
and Ch1 sites and Uiso for the Ch2 site (probability: 90%)—are displayed in Fig. 
5c and d. For the Bi site, both U11(Bi) and U33(Bi) increase with increasing 
temperature, and U33(Bi) is larger than U11(Bi) at the entire temperature 
range. The temperature evolutions suggest that the thermal vibrations of Bi 
along the c-axis are enhanced at higher temperatures, and large U33(Bi) is 
caused by atomic vibrations and/or Bi displacements along the c-axis. Atomic 
vibrations of Bi along the c-axis was more likely since the models having two 
Bi sites (0, 0.5, z±) with half occupancy did not improve the fitting parameters 
of Rietveld analyses. For the Ch1 site, Below 473 K, U11(Ch1) becomes almost 
constant, whereas U33(Ch1) continues to decrease with the decrease of the 
temperature. Comparing Fig. 5c and d, we notice that the thermal factor for 
the Ch1 site changes from highly anisotropic to almost isotropic with 
increasing the temperature from 300 to 673 K. The anomalous evolution of 
U11(Ch1) is consistent with the anomalies in the lattice constant and electrical 
resistivity. Therefore, the evolution of U11 for the Ch1 site may be related to 
the presence of the in-plane static disorder. As a fact, the BiCh1 plane contains 
disorder at the Ch1 site due to the S/Se solution. Furthermore, it is possible 
that the disorder at Ch1 would result in a disordered local structure in the Bi-
Ch1 plane. Recently, the existence of local Ch1 displacements in BiCh2-based 


11 
 
compounds have been reported using two different probes, neutron26 and X-
ray experiments29. Similar short-range displacements of Ch1 may exist in the 
present LaOBiSSe sample, but, within the present experiments and analysis, 
it is difficult to detect such a short-range displacement of the Ch1 site in 
LaOBiSSe. In that case, the Bi site may be affected to a certain extent, but the 
possibility of the Bi site displacements has not been proposed so far. In fact, 
as described above, U11(Bi) is clearly smaller than U33(Bi) at the entire 
temperature range. Therefore, we assume that the Bi site is less affected by 
the Ch1 site disorder, while thermal displacements of Bi are large, particularly 
along the c-axis. On the basis of the experimental results and the discussion 
with possible local Ch1 displacements, we propose one scenario that the Bi 
atoms are largely vibrating along the c-axis. The Bi vibration scenario is 
consistent with the atomic displacement parameters observed for Bi in 
La(O,F)BiSSe single crystals.23 
Finally, we briefly discuss the possible mechanisms behind the low 
thermal conductivity in this system. In LaOBiS2−xSex, metallic conductivity is 
enhanced by Se substitution, and low thermal conductivity is concurrently 
attained. The obtained characteristics can be ascribed to the creation of a 
phonon-glass-electron-crystal state, which has been considered to be a 
powerful strategy for designing high ZT materials.29 We consider that the low 
thermal conductivity in LaOBiS2−xSex is related to the large atomic 
displacement parameters in the Bi-Ch1 plane. Furthermore, on the basis of 
the anisotropic analysis of the atomic displacement parameters for LaOBiSSe, 
we assume that the Bi and Ch1 atoms anomalously vibrate along the c-axis 


12 
 
direction, as rattling atoms in a cage structure (for example, in skutterudite 
compounds30). The crystal structure of LaOBiS2−xSex, however, is not a cage 
structure; hence, the observed rattling-like vibration occurs within a plane 
(two-dimensional) structure. Recently, a high ZT value of 0.7 was reported in 
tetrahedrite compounds (Cu10Tr2Sb4S13; Tr denotes the transition metal) with 
low thermal conductivity.31,32 In the tetrahedrite family, the low thermal 
conductivity is achieved by lattice anharmonicity of the Cu atoms: in other 
words, in-plane rattling of Cu atoms at Cu-S planes is the origin of the low 
thermal conductivity.31,32 We assume that the low thermal conductivity in 
LaOBiSSe would also result from a mechanism similar to that observed in the 
tetrahedrite family. If the in-plane rattling can generally suppress the thermal 
conductivity of compounds with a plane structure, we obtain a new strategy 
for designing high-performance thermoelectric materials with a phonon-glass-
electron-crystal state. To elucidate the assumption above, neutron 
measurements or other measurements more sensitive to phonons (lattice 
anharmonicity) are needed. 
 
4. Conclusions 
We examined the crystal structure of a new thermoelectric material 
family, LaOBiS2−xSex, using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Upon 
substitution, Se selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Although the Se 
substitution induces buckling of the Bi-Ch1 plane, its intensification results 
in the enhancement of the metallic conductivity and thermoelectric power 


13 
 
factor. We explained that the enhancement of the power factor was attained 
owing to the increased in-plane chemical pressure. To investigate the origin of 
the low thermal conductivity of LaOBiSSe, we analysed the high-temperature 
crystal structure and atomic displacement parameters. LaOBiSSe exhibits 
anisotropic thermal expansion. Below 473 K, only the a-axis expands, while 
both a-axis and c-axis expand above 473 K. We revealed anomalously large 
atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for the Bi and Ch atoms in the Bi-Ch1 
plane. The temperature dependences of Uiso suggest that the temperature 
evolutions of the atomic vibrations of the Bi-Ch1 plane in the BiCh2 layers are 
anomalous and similar to that of the rattling atoms in a cage structure. The 
anisotropic analysis of the atomic displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for 
the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites suggests that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic 
displacement along the c-axis direction, which should presumably be the 
origin of the low thermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. In addition, we assume 
that the large Bi and Ch1 vibrations are related to the in-plane rattling, which 
is a new strategy for designing low- thermoelectric materials, as observed in 
Cu atoms of tetrahedrite compounds.
