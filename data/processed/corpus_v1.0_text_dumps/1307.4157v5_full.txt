Electrical resistivity measurements as a function of temperature between 1 K and 300 K were per-
formed at various pressures up to 3 GPa on the superconducting layered compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
(Ln = La, Ce). At atmospheric pressure, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 have superconducting
critical temperatures, Tc, of 3.3 K and 2.3 K, respectively. For both compounds, the superconducting
critical temperature Tc initially increases, reaches a maximum value of 10.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and 6.7 K for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, and then gradually decreases with increasing pressure. Both samples
also exhibit transient behavior in the region between the lower Tc phase near atmospheric pres-
sure and the higher Tc phase. This region is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting
transition, in which Tc and the transition width ∆Tc are reversible with increasing and decreasing
pressure. There is also an appreciable pressure-induced and hysteretic suppression of semiconduct-
ing behavior up to the pressure at which the maximum value of Tc is found. At pressures above the
value at which the maximum in Tc occurs, there is a gradual decrease of Tc and further suppression
of the semiconducting behavior with pressure, both of which are reversible.

INTRODUCTION
Superconductivity with a superconducting critical
temperature Tc = 8.6 K has recently been reported
in the layered compound Bi4O4S3.1,2 Following this
report,
other
BiS2-based
superconductors
including
LnO1−xFxBiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) with a Tc
as high as 10 K have been synthesized and studied.3–12
More recent work demonstrates that chemical substitu-
tion of the tetravalent ions Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4 and Ti+4
for trivalent lanthanum, La+3, in LaOBiS2 increases the
charge-carrier density and induces superconductivity.13
Most of the research on the layered BiS2 compounds has
heretofore centered on the eﬀect of chemical substitu-
tion on superconductivity.
Application of an external
pressure may also be employed as a method for reducing
the unit cell volume of these compounds and studying
the resultant eﬀect on superconductivity. In this paper,
we report measurements of the pressure dependence of
the normal state electrical resistivity between 1 K and
300 K and Tc at various pressures up to ∼3 GPa for
the compounds LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2.
We compare our results to recently reported studies of
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples synthesized under high pressure
by Kotegawa et al.7
The
qualitative
evolution
of
Tc
with
pressure
is
markedly
similar
for
both
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, which have Tc values (at atmospheric
pressure) of 3.3 K and 2.2 K, respectively.
For both
compounds, Tc initially increases, reaches a maximum
value of 10.1 K at ∼1 GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 6.7
K at ∼2 GPa for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, and then gradually de-
creases with increasing pressure. Both compounds also
exhibit striking transient behavior in the region between
the lower Tc phase near atmospheric pressure and the
higher Tc phase. This transient region is characterized
by a rapid increase of Tc and an increase of the super-
conducting transition width ∆Tc, in which both Tc and
∆Tc are reversible with increasing and decreasing pres-
sure cycles. This occurs over a range in pressure from
∼0.5 GPa to 1.1 GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and from ∼
0.5 GPa to 1.5 GPa for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. In both mate-
rials, there is a sizable pressure-induced suppression of
semiconducting behavior exhibiting hysteresis up to the
pressure at which the maximum value of Tc is found.
The rapid increase of the charge carrier density inferred
from the suppression of the semiconducting behavior cor-
relates with the rapid increase of Tc in this region. At
pressures above the value at which the maximum in Tc
occurs, there is a gradual decrease of Tc and further sup-
pression of the semiconducting behavior with pressure,
both of which are reversible.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Polycrystalline samples of LnO1−xFxBiS2
(Ln
=
La, Ce) with x = 0.5 were prepared by solid-state
reaction using powders of La2O3 (99.9%), LaF3 (99.9%),
La2S3 (99.9%), and Bi2S3 (99.9%) for LaO1−xFxBiS2,
and powders of CeF3 (99.9%) and CeO2 (99.9%) for
CeO1−xFxBiS2. Bi2S3 precursor powder was prepared
in an evacuated quartz tube by reacting Bi (99.99%) and
S (99.9%) at 500◦C for 10 hours. The Ln2S3 (Ln = La,
Ce) precursor powders were prepared in an evacuated
quartz tube by reacting chunks of La and Ce with S
grains at 800◦C for 12 hours. The starting materials with
nominal composition LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce)
were weighed, thoroughly mixed, pressed into pellets,

for 10 hours.
The products were then ground, mixed
for homogenization, pressed into pellets, and annealed
again in evacuated quartz tubes at 800◦C for 10 hours.
X-ray powder diﬀraction measurements were made using
an X-ray diﬀractometer with a Cu Kα source to assess
phase purity and to determine the crystal structure
of the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce) compounds.
Lattice parameters for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are a = 4.0613
˚A and c = 13.3157 ˚A, while for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 the
lattice parameters are a = 4.0398 ˚A and c = 13.4513 ˚A.12
Measurements of ρ(T ) under applied pressure were per-
formed up to ∼3 GPa in a clamped piston cylinder pres-
sure cell between ∼1 K and 300 K in a pumped 4He de-
war. A 1:1 by volume mixture of n-pentane and isoamyl
alcohol was used to provide a quasi-hydrostatic pressure
transmitting medium. A second set of electrical resistiv-
ity measurements were performed by releasing pressure
from the pressurized cell down to atmospheric pressure.
Annealed Pt leads were aﬃxed to gold-sputtered contact
surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard
four-wire conﬁguration. The pressure dependent super-
conducting Tc of high purity Sn, measured inductively,
was used as a manometer and calibrated against data
from Ref. 14.

gives ρ(T ) upon decreasing pressure back down to
0.31 GPa.
The temperature dependence of ρ(T ) at
lower pressures exhibits semiconducting behavior. The
semiconducting behavior is suppressed with increasing
pressure as seen from the nearly constant ρ(T ) curves
above 2 GPa. A comparison of Fig. 1(a) with Fig. 1(b)
shows that the suppression of ρ(T ) is continuous and
reversible over the full range 0.3 - 3.1 GPa. At pressures
above 2 GPa where suppression is greatest, the values
of ρ(T ) are comparable in Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b)
and reversible with pressure.
However, whereas the
suppression of ρ(T ) is reversible with pressure, the
magnitude of ρ(T ) exhibits hysteretic behavior with
pressure.
At lower pressures, measurements of ρ(T )
made during release of pressure yield higher values than
ρ(T ) measurements performed upon increasing pressure.
The diﬀerence between ρ(T ) measurements made during
increasing pressure and those made during decreasing
pressure are largest at lower pressures where the rate of
suppression of semiconducting behavior is largest. After
a release in pressure to the lowest value of 0.31 GPa,
the maximum value of ρ is nearly 14 mΩcm. This is a
factor of 2 larger than the corresponding value along the
increasing pressure path at 0.34 GPa.
Superconducting transitions at low temperature were
measured upon increasing and then releasing pressure
as shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d), respectively. There
is a striking similarity in the qualitative behavior and
evolution of the transitions in both plots. For pressures
in the range 0.5 GPa to 1.0 GPa, the superconducting
transitions broaden signiﬁcantly.
For higher pressures
above 1.0 GPa, the transition curves begin to sharpen
again at approximately 10 K. It is in this higher pres-


4
sure region where Tc passes through a maximum of
10.1 K at ∼1 GPa and then gradually decreases as
pressure increases. The evolution of both the value of
the superconducting critical temperature Tc and the
superconducting transition width ∆Tc deﬁned by the
procedure described in the text, were reversible with
respect to both increasing and decreasing pressure.
Tc was deﬁned as the temperature at which ρ falls to
50% of its value at the temperature of the onset of
superconductivity, T onset
c
, with T onset
c
determined as
illustrated in Fig. 1(c).
The temperature where the
resistivity vanishes, T0, was determined in a similar
fashion as T onset
c
using a linear extrapolation of the
resistive superconducting curve to ρ = 0. In determin-
ing Tc for the broader transitions, we used the same
criteria as for the sharper transitions; however, we make
note of the less deﬁnitive Tc for these broader transitions.
Measurements performed on CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 reveal
remarkably similar
behavior to
the
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
results. As shown in Fig. 2, the qualitative behavior of
the results are reversible upon application and release
of pressure. Measurements of ρ(T ) show semiconducting
behavior which is suppressed at higher pressures.
As
pressure is released, the semiconducting behavior is
recovered. The measured values of ρ(T ) are higher along
the reversed path during a release of pressure.
The
discrepancy between ρ(T ) measurements made during
increasing pressure and those made during decreasing
pressure are largest at lower pressures where the rate of
suppression of the semiconducting behavior is largest.
After releasing the pressure to the lowest value of 0.31
GPa, ρ is nearly 130 mΩcm; this is a factor of 1.5
larger than the corresponding value along the increasing
pressure path at 0.34 GPa.
Superconducting transitions at low temperature were
measured
for
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2
while
increasing
and
then decreasing pressure.
The trend and character
of the transitions are reversible upon application and
subsequent release of pressure as seen from a comparison
of Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 2(d). Similar to the evolution of
Tc in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, sharp superconducting transitions
are observed at low pressures up to approximately 0.5
GPa before they begin to broaden.
From both the
increasing and decreasing pressure plots (Fig. 2(c) and
Fig. 2(d), respectively), the transitions begin to broaden
signiﬁcantly up to pressures of approximately 1.5 GPa.
At pressures above 1.5 GPa, the superconducting tran-
sitions become sharp again. It is in this pressure region
where Tc passes through a maximum of 6.7 K at ∼2
GPa and then decreases gradually at higher pressures.
Figure 3 summarizes the results for the superconduct-
ing phase diagram, Tc(P), for both the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds.

pounds.
In the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, Tc initially
increases with pressure up to a maximum of 10.1 K at
1.1 GPa.
Tc then gradually decreases with a slope of
-0.30 K GPa−1. This Tc maximum is also preceded by
a reversible broadening of the superconducting transi-
tion in the pressure range 0.5 - 1.0 GPa, represented
as elongated vertical bars in Fig. 3.
In the normal
state (above the Tc(P) curve),
the semiconducting
behavior of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is continuously suppressed
with pressure as manifested in a larger energy gap ∆1
that decreases with pressure, the values of which are
indicated in the legend. The determination of the energy
gaps ∆1 and ∆2 from the ρ(T, P) data are discussed
below.
This maximum in Tc(P) at 1.1 GPa occurs in
the vicinity of a change of slope in the normal state
log(ρ) vs. P curve, measured at 11 K, as shown in Fig. 4.
In the case of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, Tc initially increases
to a maximum of 6.7 K at ∼2 GPa and then decreases
slowly with a slope of -0.30 K GPa−1 at higher pressures.
Leading up to this maximum is a reversible broadening
of the superconducting transition in the region 0.5 -
1.5 GPa depicted by the lengthened vertical bars in
Fig. 3.
In the normal state (above the Tc(P) curve),
the semiconducting behavior of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 is also
continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested in
a larger energy gap ∆1 that decreases with pressure,

The
maximum in Tc(P) at 2 GPa also occurs in the vicinity
of a slope change in log(ρ) vs. P, measured at 7.6 K, as
shown in Fig. 4.
The width of the superconducting transitions in the
broadening region, represented by the vertical bars in
Fig. 3, is ∆Tc ∼4 - 6 K. Pressure gradients in the
piston-cylinder cell were estimated from the error in
pressure to be of the order ∆P ∼± 0.05 GPa where
the error in pressure was determined from the width of
the superconducting transition of the Sn manometer. It
is possible to relate ∆Tc and ∆P through the slope of
Tc(P) in Fig. 3 so that ∆Tc ≃(dTc(P)/dP) ∆P. Even
though ∆P is small and constant for pressures measured
as part of this study, ∆Tc can be large when dTc(P)/dP
is large (i.e., in the pressure region where broadened
transitions are observed). Rough estimates of ∆Tc were
made using ∆P = 0.1 GPa and slopes of 18 K/GPa
and 11 K/GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2,
respectively. These calculations yield values of ∆Tc =
1.8 K and 1.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2,
respectively, which are of the correct order of magnitude.
The size of the vertical bars characterizing ∆Tc also
appear to qualitatively track with the local slope of
Tc(P) for most pressures in Fig. 3.
Kotegawa et al.7 previously reported the pressure de-
pendence of Tc for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples synthesized
under high pressure, which apparently exhibit only the
high Tc phase uncovered in the present study. In their
experiments, it was found that Tc exhibits a maximum
of 10.6 K at ∼1 GPa and then gradually decreases with a
slope of -0.40 K/GPa (compared to -0.30 K/GPa in this
study) at pressures above 1 GPa. The low Tc phase and

broadened superconducting transitions bridging the low
Tc and high Tc phases, however, are not present in their
Tc(P) phase diagram. The presence of only the high Tc
phase at ambient pressure in the study by Kotegawa
et al.7 suggests that synthesis of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
samples under high pressure has already induced the
high Tc superconducting phase.
From the plot of log(ρ) vs.
P at low temperature
displayed in Fig. 4, there is a noticeable change in the
magnitude of the suppression rate, dlog(ρ)/dP, for both
the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds.
In the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, there is a strong sup-
pression of resistivity up to ∼1.2 GPa, followed by a
weaker suppression at higher pressures. In the case of
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, there is a strong suppression of resistiv-
ity up to ∼1.8 GPa, followed by a weaker suppression
at higher pressures. The ρ(P) data for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 were taken in the normal state at
11 K and 7.6 K, respectively. These temperatures occur
just above the onset of the superconducting transition
at T onset
c
. The dotted lines in Fig. 4 are guides to the
eye for the rates of suppression of log(ρ) with pressure.
There is a correlation between the pressure at which
the maximum Tc occurs in the Tc(P) phase diagram
of Fig. 3 and the pressure where the suppression rate
changes in the plot of log(ρ) vs.
P in Fig. 4.
For
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, this “critical pressure” occurs at ∼1.2
GPa, while for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 it is located at ∼1.8
GPa.
In both compounds, there is also an apparent
pressure hysteresis as seen from the separation between
the increasing pressure data (open symbols) and the
decreasing pressure data (ﬁlled symbols). This pressure
hysteresis becomes more pronounced where the suppres-
sion rate is higher; i.e., below the previously mentioned


7
critical pressures.
The semiconducting behavior of the ρ(T ) data and its
rapid suppression with pressure was noted in the work
of Kotegawa et al.7 on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound
synthesized under high pressure. They observed that the
resistivity could be described over two distinct regions by
the relation
ρ(T ) = ρ0e∆/2kBT
(1)
where ρ0 is a constant and ∆is an energy gap. Analysis
of the ρ(T ) data at atmospheric pressure in these two
regions, 200 - 300 K and Tc - 20 K, yielded energy gaps
∆1/kB ≈140 K and ∆2/kB ≈1.86 K, respectively.
Both energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2 were found to decrease
with pressure. In this study, we have also determined
values of the energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2 from linear ﬁts of
ρ(T ) data on a plot of log(ρ) vs. 1/T, as illustrated in
Fig. 5, which displays our ρ(T ) data for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
upon increasing pressure.
From similar plots for
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 upon decreasing pressure as well as for
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 upon increasing and decreasing pressure,
the two energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2, corresponding to the
high and low temperature regions, respectively, could
also be extracted.
The behavior of energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2 as a function
of pressure for both LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2
are shown in Fig. 6. The energy gaps decrease rapidly
with pressure, similar to the behavior observed by
Kotegawa et al.7 However, it is interesting to note that
the values of the energy gaps for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 at
atmospheric pressure shown in Fig. 6 are considerably
larger than the values obtained by Kotegawa et al.7
The energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2 both exhibit hysteretic
behavior below a critical pressure of ∼1.3 GPa for
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and ∼2 GPa for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2; these
critical pressures correlate with the pressures where
the slope, dlog(ρ)/dP, changes (at temperatures in the
normal state right above Tc) in the log(ρ) vs. P plots
(Fig. 4) and also correlate with the transition pressures
into the high Tc phase for both LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Fig. 3).
Speciﬁc heat C(T) measurements at ambient pressure
have recently been made on both the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds.12 The samples in Ref. 12
and in the present study were from the same batch. In
the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, these C(T) measurements
suggest that the superconductivity observed at ∼3
K for pressures less than ∼0.5 GPa is a bulk phe-
nomenon. In Fig. 5 of Ref. 12, there is a clear jump in
C(T)/T at Tc = 2.93 K. This value of Tc is close to the
temperature where ρ vanishes in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2.
We
expect, therefore, that the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample in this
study exhibits bulk superconductivity at lower pressures.
It is still unclear whether or not the higher Tc su-
perconducting transitions at pressures above 0.5 GPa
are associated with bulk superconductivity. The narrow
widths of the superconducting transitions would seem to
suggest that the superconductivity in this pressure range
is a bulk phenomenon. However, the sharpness of the
resistive transitions is also consistent with a ﬁlamentary
zero resistance path through the sample with a narrow
distribution of Tc values that could be due to small
amounts of a superconducting phase, rather than bulk
superconductivity.
High pressure magnetization mea-
surements in a SQUID magnetometer were performed
on several pieces of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 to determine the
character of the 10 K superconducting phase by Tau-
four, Bud’ko and Canﬁeld.15 It was diﬃcult to observe
a diamagnetic signal against the large background from
the pressure cell. This suggests possible inhomogeneity
in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample.
In the case of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, however, there is no
indication in the ambient pressure C(T) measurements
of bulk superconductivity.12 The lack of a discernible
jump in speciﬁc heat, however, could be due to sample
inhomogeneity and/or the proximity of Tc = 1.9 K to
the base temperature T = 1.8 K of the speciﬁc heat
measurements and needs to be investigated further.
The rapid increase of Tc and broadening of the
superconducting transition with pressure, as well as its
reversibility with pressure for both compounds, suggest
the existence of a gradual, pressure-induced transition
between superconducting phases with a lower Tc at
lower pressure and a higher Tc at higher pressure. The
broadening of the superconducting transition feature in
the transition region, ∼1 GPa wide for both compounds,
could be a consequence of the large slope of Tc(P) in
that pressure range (i.e., ∆Tc ≃(dTc(P)/dP) ∆P). It
might also be due to a spatial distribution of the two
phases in the transition region. In this latter scenario,
as the applied pressure is increased in the transition
region, the amount of the high pressure phase grows at
the expense of the low pressure phase, until the sample
is completely transformed into the high pressure phase
at the end of the transition region. The markedly similar
features in the Tc versus pressure diagrams shown in
Fig. 3 for the two compounds LnO1−xFxBiS2 (Ln = La,
Ce) suggests that this behavior could be characteristic
in general of the entire class of LnO1−xFxBiS2 materials.
One possible explanation for this behavior is that there
is a distribution of pressures at which the transformation
between the two phases takes place within the transition
region. This distribution could be associated with some
type of inhomogeneity (either electronic or atomic) in the
samples. Experiments are currently in progress to search
for a possible pressure-induced structural transition in
these materials and to see whether the pressure-induced
transition can be sharpened by improving the synthesis

methods. The synthesis of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under pres-
sure with a Tc of ∼10 K suggests the possibility that the
transformation pressure between the low and high pres-
sure phases can be reduced to zero pressure by using a
diﬀerent synthesis route.10

SUMMARY
We have observed a striking enhancement of super-
conductivity accompanying the suppression of semicon-
ducting behavior with pressure in the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
compounds (Ln = La, Ce) at critical pressures of ∼1.1
GPa and ∼2.0 GPa for Ln = La and Ce, respectively.
There is markedly similar behavior in the electrical
resistivity measurements under applied pressure for
these two BiS2-based superconductors LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. Electrical resistivity measurements
reveal that for both compounds, the suppression of their
semiconducting behavior is hysteretic upon application
of pressure. The semiconducting behavior of the electri-
cal resistivity is consistent with two energy gaps that are
suppressed with pressure in a similar way. The pressure
dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits hysteresis
below a critical pressure where there is a change in slope
of log(ρ) vs. P and where the maximum value of Tc is
observed.
Furthermore, for both compounds, we have
discovered a continuous and reversible transient region
between regions of low and high Tc, which is character-
ized by a broadening of the superconducting transition;
however, the mechanism behind the broadening of the
superconducting
transitions between the
lower and
higher Tc regions is unclear. The broadening could be a
simple consequence of the sensitive pressure-dependence
of Tc in this region, which, when coupled with even
a modest pressure gradient, could result in broader
measured superconducting transitions. Sample inhomo-
geneity might also be responsible for the distribution
of transition pressures seen in the broadening region,
and the possibility of pressure-induced structural phase
transitions is currently being investigated with x-ray
diﬀraction measurements under pressure.
Given the
striking similarity in behavior for these two BiS2-based
superconductors, further electrical resistivity measure-
ments under pressure on other compounds could point
to characteristic behavior of BiS2-based superconductors
in general.
In experiments currently underway we have observed
the same qualitative behavior for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2
and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds as were observed in the
the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds sug-
gesting this is indeed a general phenomenon in the
class of LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. Our results on the
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound may be compared to the re-
cently reported study of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 specimens pre-
pared in a solid state reaction by Selvan et al.16 For the
compounds with Ln = La, Ce and Pr, there is a dra-
matic decrease in the electrical resistivity with pressure
that reﬂects a continuous suppression of semiconducting
behavior.
Although the temperature coeﬃcient of the
electrical resistivity, dρ/dT , at the highest pressures is
small for these Ln = La, Ce and Pr compounds, the
coeﬃcient nevertheless remains negative (dρ/dT < 0), so
that we cannot deﬁnitely conclude that the metallic state
has been achieved. We have, however, been able to reach
a metallic state for Ln = Nd, indicated by a positive tem-
perature coeﬃcient of resistivity (dρ/dT > 0), consistent
with a semiconductor-metal transition. Experiments to
pressures in excess of 3 GPa are currently under way to
see if deﬁnitive metallic states (i.e., dρ/dT > 0) can be
attained for the Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds.
