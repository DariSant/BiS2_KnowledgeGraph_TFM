Abstract 
Sb- and Se-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals have been successfully grown using 
CsCl/KCl flux. Sb and Se substitution dependence of the superconductivity on CeOBiS2 
was investigated and the superconducting phase diagram at above 0.3 K was described. 
The non-linear boundary between superconductivity and non-superconductivity was 
revealed.

1. Introduction 
Layered superconductors exhibited high transition temperatures such as cuprate1) and 
iron-based 
superconductors.2) 
CeOBiS2 
is 
one 
of 
the 
BiS2-based 
layered 
superconductors such as La(O,F)BiS2 3) which is a layered superconductor. Several 
BiS2-based layered compounds with superconductivity require the F substitution in the 
O-site for the electron carrier introduction. Among them, CeOBiS2 without F 
substitution exhibits superconductivity by the Ce valence fluctuation.4,5) The Ce valence 
fluctuation formed at of Ce3+ and Ce4+ mixing valence state was observed by X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)5) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS).6) 
Furthermore, the temperature dependence of resistivity at a normal state was reported 
weak semiconducting-like behavior.4,5) On the other hand, the CeOBiS2 with 
Arrhenius-type 
behavior 
at 
a 
normal 
state 
resistivity 
was 
reported 
no 
superconductivity.7) This difference was explained by the existence of two kinds of local 
structure configurations in the CeOBiS2 which intrinsically exhibited semiconducting 
behavior, but a metallic phase appeared due to the local distortions.8) Therefore, we 
focused on the superconducting CeOBiS2 which was a simple chemical formulation in 
BiS2-based layered superconductors. Previously we found the superconductivity was 


suppressed with Sb substitution into the Bi-site, which is presumed to originate from the 
change of the crystal system.9) In contrast, the CeOBiS2 superconductor with Se 
substitution into the S-site exhibited enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure10), 
suppression of in-plane disorder, and decrease of Ce ions valence. As a result, an 
increase in superconducting transition temperature was observed.11) Especially, the 
in-plane chemical pressure increases the density of states at the Fermi level, which may 
increase the phonon frequency. The possibility of the enhancement of superconductivity 
by these phenomena was suggested.10)  
In this paper, the effect of both Sb and Se substitutions for superconductivity at 
above 0.3 K was systematically investigated using the Sb- and Se-substituted CeOBiS2 
[CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2] single crystals. Then superconducting phase diagram of Sb and Se 
substitution in CeOBiS2 was revealed.  
 
2. Experimental Details 
Sb- and Se-substituted CeOBiS2 [CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2] single crystals were grown 
using CsCl/KCl flux.4,12,13) The raw materials of Ce2S3, Bi2O3, Bi2S3, Bi, Sb (or Sb2O3), 
and Se were weighed to a total amount of 0.8 g for a nominal composition of 
CeOBi1-xSbxS2-ySey (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.20, 0.125 ≤ y ≤ 0.500). The molar ratio of the CsCl/KCl 


flux was CsCl:KCl = 5:3 with a total amount of 5.0 g. The raw materials (0.8 g) and 
CsCl/KCl flux (5.0 g) were mixed and ground using a mortar and then sealed in an 
evacuated quartz tube (~10 Pa). The prepared quartz tube was heated at 950 °C (Except 
for x = 0, y = 0.500, which was performed at 1000 °C.) for 10 h, followed by cooling to 
600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, then the sample was spontaneously cooled down to room 
temperature (~30 °C) in the furnace. The heated quartz tube was opened to air and the 
obtained materials were washed and filtered to remove the CsCl/KCl flux using distilled 
water.  
The obtained crystals confirmed the CeOBiS2 structure5) by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
(Rigaku; MultiFlex) with CuKα radiation. The compositional ratio of the grown crystals 
was evaluated using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Bruker; Quantax 70) 
associated with the observation of the microstructure, based on scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi High-Technologies; TM3030). Analytical compositions of 
each element were defined as CXX (XX: Bi, Sb, S, and Se). The obtained compositional 
values were normalized using CS + CSe = 2 (S + Se analytical composition was 2), and 
then Bi, and Sb compositions (CBi, and CSb) were determined.  
The picked single crystals at random from each sample lot were measured the 
resistivity−temperature (ρ−T) characteristics. The ρ−T characteristics of the picked 


single crystals were determined using the standard four-probe method with a constant 
current density mode range of 20−50 mA/cm2 using a physical property measurement 
system (Quantum Design; PPMS DynaCool). The electrical terminals were fabricated 
using Ag paste (DuPont; 4922N). The ρ–T characteristics in the temperature range of 
0.3−15 K were evaluated based using the adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) 
option for the PPMS. A magnetic field of 3.0 T at 1.9 K was applied to operate the ADR, 
which was subsequently removed. Consequently, the temperature of the sample 
decreased to approximately 0.3 K. The measurement of ρ−T characteristics was initiated 
at the lowest temperature (~0.3 K), which was spontaneously increased to 15 K. The 
superconducting transition temperature with zero resistivity (Tczero) was estimated from 
the ρ–T characteristics. The Tczero was determined as the temperature at which the 
resistivity is below approximately 300 µΩcm (Except for CSb = 0.068, CSe = 0.28, which 
was determined at 3.0 mΩcm due to a technical problem.). The compositional ratio of 
the ρ−T characteristics measured samples had been evaluated by EDS, and then they 
were employed for the superconducting phase diagram.  
 
3. Results and Discussion 
The obtained CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals exhibited a plate-like shape with a 


size of approximately 1.0 mm and a thickness of 100−200 µm, which were similar in 
shape to Sb-substituted CeOBiS2 [CeO(Bi,Sb)S2] single crystals.9) However, the 
well-developed plane in CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals was rougher than that of 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 
single 
crystals. 
A 
well-developed 
plane 
in 
the 
obtained 
CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals corresponded to the c-plane of CeOBiS2 structure4) by 
the XRD patterns. The c-axis lattice parameters for the obtained CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 
single crystals were range of 13.53−13.62 Å with depending on both Sb and Se 
substitution amount. Analytical compositions of Sb and Se in the obtained 
CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals were lower than those of the nominal compositions, 
and these analytical compositions exhibited dispersion in the same grown lot. Table I 
summarized the nominal (x and y) and analytical (CBi, CSb, CS, and CSe) compositions 
with normalized using CS + CSe = 2 for the CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals. All 
samples exhibited the Bi-site deficiency which was observed CBi + CSb < 1. The amount 
of Bi-site deficiency was in the range of 4−9 at% which was a similar range of the only 
Sb-substituted CeOBiS2 [CeO(Bi,Sb)S2] single crystals.9) The Bi-site deficiency values 
were higher than CeOBiS2 without Sb substitution,14,15) this indicated that Sb 
substitution enhanced the Bi-site deficiency in the CeOBiS2 structure. Besides, we 
investigated the compositions of the obtained CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals into the 


difference of Sb source which was Sb or Sb2O3. And then this result hardly changed.  
The CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals at random in each lot grown from each 
nominal composition were picked, and the ρ–T measurements and compositional 
analysis were performed for the superconducting phase diagram investigation. The ρ−T 
characteristics of some typical CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals were shown in Figure 
1. Weak semiconducting-like behavior at near above superconducting transition 
temperature in a normal state was observed. At first glance, a correlation between 
normal state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature seems to exist. 
However, in the case of the samples without superconducting transition (Ex. CSb = 0.05, 
CSe = 0.09), the normal state resistivity was lower than that of superconducting samples. 
Then the relationship between normal state resistivity and superconductivity was 
unclear in this experiment. Figure 2 shows the superconducting phase diagram of Sb 
and Se substitution dependence for CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2 single crystals. The data of 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals were referred from Ref. 9. The superconducting transition 
temperature with zero resistivity (Tczero) was decreased with the increase in Sb 
substitution and increased with the increase in Se substitution. Superconductivity in 
CeOBiS2 was suppressed as the Sb substitution, enhanced by the Se substitution. Those 
behaviors exhibited the same trend as previous reports.9,11) In other words, the Sb 


substitution region with superconducting observation was spread by the Se substitution. 
The boundary between superconductivity and non-superconductivity at above 0.3 K 
showed non-linear which is plotted in the dashed line in Figure 2 (b). That boundary 
showed the dome shape at CSe = 0.15−0.30 region which increased the Tczero. 
Se-substituted CeOBiS2 [CeOBi(S,Se)2] superconducting phase diagram showed a 
similar dome shape which originated from the in-plane chemical pressure effects10) and 
decrease of carrier concentration due to the Ce valence state.11) We assumed that the 
dome shape behavior of superconducting transition temperature in Figure 2 (b) 
originated from the same phenomena.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Sb- and Se-substituted CeOBiS2 [CeO(Bi,Sb)(S,Se)2] single crystals were grown and 
measured the superconducting transition temperature. A superconducting phase diagram 
with CSb < 0.18, CSe < 0.45 for CeOBiS2 was revealed. The boundary between 
superconductivity and non-superconductivity at above 0.3 K showed a non-linear line 
with the dome shape at CSe = 0.15−0.30 region.
