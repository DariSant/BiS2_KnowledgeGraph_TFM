We report appearance of superconductivity in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. The bulk polycrystalline 
samples CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 are synthesized by conventional solid state reaction route 
via vacuum encapsulation technique. Detailed structural analysis showed that the studied 
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group with lattice 
parameters a = 4.016(3) Å, c = 13.604(2) Å. DC magnetization measurement (MT-curve) shows 
the ferromagnetic signal at the low temperature region. The superconductivity is established in 
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 at Tc
onset = 2.5K by electrical transport measurement. Under applied magnetic 
field both Tc onset and Tc (ρ =0) decrease to lower temperatures and an upper critical field 
[Hc2(0)] above 1.2Tesla is estimated. The results suggest coexistence of ferromagnetism and 
superconductivity for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample.

Introduction: 
 
The recent discovery of the BiS2-based layered superconductors Bi4O4S3 [1, 2] and 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE-La, Nd, Pr, Yb & Ce) [3-9] had been of tremendous interest for the 
condensed matter community. These compounds are very similar in crystal structure to the 
layered high Tc cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. In the high Tc cuprate superconductors, 
the superconducting CuO2 layers are separated by blocking layers [10], while in case of Fe-based 
compounds, the same role is played by the FeAs layers [11]. The new class of superconductors 
possesses superconducting BiS2 layers being separated by charge reservoir blocking layers [12, 
13]. Both experimental and theoretical studies showed that BiS2 layered compounds exhibit 
multiband behaviors with dominant electron charge carriers originating from the Bi 6px and 6py 
bands in the normal state [1, 14]. Theoretical studies especially for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound 
indicated that the Fermi level crosses conduction bands and thus yields electron pockets [15]. 
There is also a suggestion that BiS2 based new superconductors could be conventional 
superconductors with strong electron phonon coupling [16-18]. The structural instability places 
these compounds in close proximity to the competing ferroelectric and charge density wave 
(CDW) phases [15]. This is similar to that as the spin-density wave (SDW) instability in iron 
based superconductors [19]. The experimental studies for BiS2-based materials have focused on 
increasing the charge carrier concentration via chemical substitution within the blocking layer as 
well as through a reduction of the unit cell volume via the application of an external pressure, for 
example, recent studies on the BiS2-based compounds involving chemical substitution [20, 21]. 
The LaOBiS2 and NdOBiS2, having analogous BiS2 layers, had been found to show 
superconductivity upon electron doping [22]. It has been proposed that superconductivity and 
ferromagnetism coexist in the CeO1-xFxBiS2 compounds; the ferromagnetic order state 
presumably arises due to the local moments of Ce at low temperatures [9]. In this short 
communication we report superconductivity of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 with a typical BiS2 layer. Both 
compounds CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 crystallized in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group. We 
found the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound shows ferromagnetic transition near 4K in magnetization 
measurements. It is found that the parent phase is a bad metal, and F doped CeOBiS2 compound 
exhibits superconductivity at 2.5K along with 4K ferromagnetism.

Experimental: 
 
Bulk polycrystalline samples CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 were synthesized by standard 
solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Ce, Bi, S, CeF3, and CeO2 are 
weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon 
atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in a 
quartz tube. Sealed quartz ampoule is placed in tube furnace and heat treated at 7000C for 12h 
with the typical heating rate of 2oC/min., and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of 
six hours to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was 
performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-80o in equal 2θ step of 
0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed 
using the standard FullProf program. The electrical transport and magnetization measurements 
were performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) as a 
function of both temperature and applied magnetic field. 
Results and Discussion: 
XRD data at room temperature of CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples are shown in 
Figure 1. Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns is carried out for the both compounds. These 
compounds are crystallized in tetragonal structure in space group P4/nmm with small impurity 
peaks of Bi and Bi2S3. Rietveld refined lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and site 
occupancy are shown in the Table I. The Rietveld fitted results exhibited that the lattice 
parameter a axis of CeOBiS2 is 4.016Å and the same is increased for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample to 
4.037 Å. The c-axis lattice constant is 13.604 Å and 13.407 Å respectively for CeOBiS2 and 
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples. The decrease in c-axis parameter indicates that F is doped successfully 
at the O site as the ionic radius of F is smaller than that of O. These results are in good agreement 
with the reported phase diagrams for NdO1-xFxBiS2 and CeO1-xFxBiS2 compounds [4, 8]. 
Figure 2 depict temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at 10Oe applied field 
for the superconducting CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, we observed a strong ferromagnetic signal below 
about 4 K. No diamagnetic signal is observed down to 1.9 K. Perhaps possible lower temperature 
(below 2.4K, seen in transport measurements, next section) superconducting diamagnetism is 
prevailed over by ferromagnetism. It seems the Ce sub-lattice is magnetically ordered at below

about 4K. Inset of Fig.2 shows magnetization-hysteresis (MH) curve at 2K, indicating clearly the 
ferromagnetic nature. Similar magnetization results are obtained for studied CeOBiS2 as well. 
This result is in confirmation with an earlier report on CeO1-xFxBiS2 compounds [8]. May it be 
that that superconductivity occurs in the BiS2 layers along with ferromagnetic order in the CeO 
layer.  
Figure 3(a) presents the resistivity versus temperature (ρ–T) plots for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 
sample in the applied magnetic field of up to 10 kOe in temperature range of 1.9 – 3K. The result 
is similar to that as reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. The superconductivity sets at the 
onset of ρ–T plots and is complete at ρ = 0.  In this case, with the application of the magnetic 
field, both the onset and offset Tc shift toward lower temperature. The inset of the same shows 
the resistivity in expanded temperature range of 1.9–250K of the CeOBiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
The parent compound is showing semiconducting like behavior from 250K down to 1.9K. The 
superconducting Tc onset is observed for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound in resistivity curve at 2.5K 
and the zero resistivity Tc(ρ = 0) at 1.9K.   
Figure 3 (b) shows the temperature dependence upper critical field μ0Hc2(T ), which has 
been fitted through Ginzburg-Landau theory by using ρn =90% criterion. In the studied 
temperature range the dependence of field μ0Hc2(T ) is nearly linear. The upper critical field Hc2 
evolves with temperature from the formula Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)(1 − t 2)/(1 + t 2) where t = T/Tc. 
From the fitting, we can clearly see that, initially the behavior of Hc2 with T is linear near Tc and 
extends up to a temperature of 0.5K and after that the same nearly saturates. The Hc2(0) for the 
sample is found to be about 1.2 Tesla. The Hc2(0) value determined by us is in agreement with 
other reported literature for BiS2 based superconducting compounds [6,8].
