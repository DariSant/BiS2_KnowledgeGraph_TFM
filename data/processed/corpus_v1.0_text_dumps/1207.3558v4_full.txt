Layered superconductors have provided some interesting fields in 
condensed matter physics owing to the low dimensionality of their 
electronic states. For example, the high-Tc (high transition 
temperature) cuprates and the Fe-based superconductors possess a 
layered crystal structure composed of a stacking of spacer 
(blocking) layers and conduction (superconducting) layers, CuO2 
planes or Fe-Anion layers. The spacer layers provide carriers to the 
conduction layers and induce exotic superconductivity.  Recently, 
we have reported superconductivity in the novel BiS2-based layered 
compound Bi4O4S3. It was found that superconductivity of Bi4O4S3 
originates from the BiS2 layers. The crystal structure is composed of 
a stacking of BiS2 superconducting layers and the spacer layers, 
which resembles those of high-Tc cuprate and the Fe-based 
superconductors. Here we report a discovery of a new type of 
BiS2-based layered superconductor LaO1-xFxBiS2, with a Tc as high 
as 10.6 K.

1.  Introduction 
 Layered crystal structures are an exotic stage to explore superconductors with a high 
transition temperature (Tc) and to discuss the mechanisms of exotic superconductivity, as have 
the high-Tc cuprates1-4) and the Fe-based superconductors.5-13) The discovery of basic 
superconducting layers, such as the CuO2 plane and Fe2An2 (An = P, As, S, Se, Te) layers, 
have opened new fields in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors, 
because many analogous superconductors can be designed by changing the structure of the 
spacer layers. Recently, we reported superconductivity in the novel BiS2-based 


 
superconductor Bi4O4S3.14) The crystal structure analysis indicated that Bi4O4S3 had a layered 
crystal structure with space group of I4/mmm. The structure is composed of a stacking of 
rock-salt-type BiS2 layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1-x layers (blocks), where x indicates the defects of 
SO4
2- ions at the interlayer sites. Thus, the parent phase (x = 0) is Bi6O8S5, and Bi4O4S3 is 
expected to have about 50 % defects of the SO4
2- site (x = 0.5). The band calculations 
indicated that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) was metallic while the parent phase of Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) was 
found to be a band insulator with Bi3+. In Bi4O4S3, the Fermi level lies within the bands which 
mainly originate from the Bi 6p orbitals. In particular, the Fermi level is just on the peak 
position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS2 layer. With respect 
to the fact that the BiS2 layers mainly contribute to the superconductivity of Bi4O4S3, we 
expected that the BiS2 layer would be a basic structure for a new class of an exotic 
superconducting family. Therefore we investigated the electron doping effects in an analogous 
BiS2-based layered compound LaOBiS2.15) The parent phase of LaOBiS2 is a band insulator, 
and possesses a layered structure composed of BiS2 layers and La2O2 layers like Bi6O8S5. 
Here we report the evolution of superconductivity in the BiS2-based layered compound 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 by electron doping via F substitution at the O site. The appearance of 
superconductivity upon electron doping is corresponding to the case of Bi4O4S3. 
 
 
2. Experimental details 
Polycrystalline samples of LaO1-xFxBiS2 were prepared using three different methods, 
AP1, AP2 and HP, where AP and HP stand for the second annealing at “ambient pressure” and 
“high pressure”, respectively. All the chemicals used in this study were purchased from 
Kojundo Chemical Lab. For the method AP1, we prepared the polycrystalline samples using 
powders of La2O3 (99.9%), LaF3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Bi2S3 and Bi (99.99%) grains. The 
Bi2S3 powders were prepared by reacting Bi and S (99.9%) grains at 500 ºC in an evacuated 
quartz tube. The starting materials with a nominal composition of LaO1-xFxBiS2 were 
well-mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 800 ºC 
for 10 h. The product was ground, mixed for homogenization, pressed into pellets and 
annealed again in an evacuated quartz tube at 800 ºC for 10 h. For the method AP2, we 
prepared the polycrystalline samples using powders of Bi2O3 (99.9%), BiF3 (99.9%), La2S3, 
Bi2S3 and Bi grains. The sample preparation process is almost the same as AP1, except for the 
heating temperature. Using this method, we could obtain single-phase samples with heating at 
700 ºC. For the method HP, we prepared precursor powders of LaO1-xFxBiS2 by first annealing 
with the process in AP2, and performed a second annealing at 600 ºC under a high pressure of 
2 GPa using a cubic-anvil high pressure synthesis instrument with 180 ton press. 


 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected by a RIGAKU x-ray diffractometer 
with Cu-K radiation using the 2- method. Lattice parameters were calculated using the 
peak positions by least-square calculations. Rietveld refinements were performed using 
RIETAN2000 program.16) In the refinement, the small impurity peaks near 27.5º and 43.5º 
were excluded. The schematic image of the crystal structure was depicted using VESTA.17) 
Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility from 15 to 2 K after both 
zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) was measured using a superconducting 
quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with Magnetic Properties Measurement 
System (Quantum Design). Temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 to 2 K was 
measured using the four terminals method with Physical Properties Measurement System 
(Quantum Design). The Tc
onset was defined to be a temperature where the resistivity begins to 
decrease. 
 
3.  Results 
3.1 Structural analysis of LaO1-xFxBiS2. 
LaOBiS2 has a layered crystal structure with a space group of P4/nmm. Figure 1(a) 
displays a schematic image of the crystal structure of LaOBiS2. The structure is composed of 
a stacking of La2O2 layers and Bi2S4 layers (two BiS2 layers in the unit cell), which is 
analogous to the Bi4O4S3 superconductor (see Fig. 1(b)). To dope electrons into the BiS2 
conduction layers, we substituted O2- by F- with a range of x = 0 ~ 0.7 in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Figure 
2(a) shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for x = 0 and 0.5 synthesized using three 
methods of AP1, AP2 and HP (see Methods). Almost all of the observed peaks are well 
indexed to the space group of P4/nmm (Fig. 2(b)), except for a few peaks relating to impurity 
phases of BiF3 or LaF3 near 27.5 º and 43.5º. For x ≥ 0.4, impurity peaks appear, indicating 
the existence of a solubility limit of O/F near x = 0.4. It is found that the XRD profiles for the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples prepared using two different methods of AP1 and AP2. For the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample prepared by HP, the broadening of the peaks is observed, which 
implies that LaOBiS2 system is not stable at high pressures. To confirm the crystal structure of 
the F-substituted system, we performed Rietveld refinement. Figure 2b shows the result of 
Rietveld refinement for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (AP2). The obtained lattice parameters and reliability 
factor are a = 4.0527 Å, c = 13.3237 Å, Rwp = 13.12%. The obtained atomic coordinates are 
summarized in Table 1. Figure 2(c-e) display the nominal x dependence of the calculated 
lattice parameters of a, c and V for x = 0 ~ 0.7 (AP1) and x = 0.5 (AP2). The a lattice 
parameter does not exhibit a remarkable F concentration dependence. The c lattice parameter 
and volume (V) obviously decrease with increasing F concentration up to x = 0.5. For x >0.5, 
the changes in lattice constants are saturated, which indicates that the O/F solubility limit is 
near x = 0.5. 
 


 
3.2 Magnetic susceptibility measurements for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
In this article, we show the physical property data for x = 0.5 because a 
superconducting transition was not observed for x ≤ 0.4 and the best superconducting 
properties were obtained for x = 0.5. Figure 3(a, b) show the temperature dependence of 
magnetic susceptibility () from 15 to 2 K and an enlargement around the onset of the 
superconducting transition for x = 0.5 (AP1). The onset of Tc is estimated to be ~2.7 K, and a 
large diamagnetic signal appears below 2.5 K. The calculated shielding volume fraction at 2 K 
is 11.0 %. Figure 3(c, d) show the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility from 15 
to 2 K and an enlargement around the onset transition for x = 0.5 (AP2). The onset of Tc is 
roughly estimated to be ~3 K, and a large diamagnetic signal appears below 2.5 K. The 
calculated shielding volume fraction at 2 K is 13.4 %. Although superconducting signals are 
observed in both Fig. 2(a) and 2(c), the Tc and the shielding volume fraction were low. 
However, interestingly, both samples showed very slight drops at 10 K in the temperature 
dependence of magnetic susceptibility. Then, we expected that the maximum Tc of this system 
is as high as 10 K. This implies that the electron doping level is not optimal, namely 
under-doped, due to the O/F solubility limit near x = 0.5. Therefore, we performed high 
pressure annealing to further increase the F concentration, because the high pressure synthesis 
technique is generally advantageous for obtaining samples with a smaller lattice. Figure 3(e, 
f) show the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for x = 0.5 (HP). As we 
expected, very large shielding volume fraction as large as 100 % is observed. Furthermore, a 
dramatic enhancement of Tc is observed. The onset of superconducting transition is above 10 
K, and a large diamagnetic signal is observed below 8 K as shown in Fig. 3(f).  
 
3.3 Transport properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for x = 0.5 (HP). 
Resistivity increases with decreasing temperature and a superconducting transition is 
observed at low temperatures. This behavior resembles the case of the carrier-doped band 
insulators, such as B-doped diamond18,19) and the HfNCl family20-22). As shown in Fig. 4(b), 
the onset of the superconducting transition is observed at 10.6 K where the onset temperature 
(Tc
onset) is defined to be a temperature at which resistivity begins to decrease as indicated by 
the arrow. Figure 4(c) displays the temperature dependence of resistivity below 15 K under 
magnetic fields up to 5 T. To obtain a magnetic field – temperature phase diagram, we plotted 
the Tc
onset and the zero-resistivity temperature (Tc
zero) with the respective applied fields in Fig. 
4(d). The upper critical field is estimated to be 10 T using the WHH theory, which gives 
0Hc2(0) = -0.69Tc(d0Hc2 / dT)|Tc.23) 
 
 
4.  Discussion 


 
Here we discuss the requirements of the evolution of bulk superconductivity in 
LaO1-xFxBiS2. The F-concentration dependence of structural properties indicates that the O/F 
solubility limit seems to be near x = 0.5. A superconducting transition is observed for x 
(nominal) ≥ 0.5. However the shielding volume fraction in the magnetic susceptibility 
measurement is only 13.4 % for the best sample of x = 0.5 (AP2), which implies that the 
electron doping level is in the under-doped region of this system. Therefore, we performed the 
high pressure annealing to achieve further doping of F. Figure 5 shows the XRD profiles near 
the (102) and (004) peaks. The (004) peak slightly shifts to higher angles after high pressure 
annealing, indicating that the c axis decreases. This change indicates that the F concentration 
increased by the high pressure annealing. As described in 3-1, the x = 0.5 (AP2) sample 
contains small amount of BiF3 and LaF3. The F ions would be supplied from the impurity 
fluorides. With the fact that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by a slight increase of F 
concentration from x = 0.5, we guess the optimal doping level is slightly above x = 0.5. The 
estimated optimal doping level is comparable to that of Bi4O4S3. Therefore, we will be able to 
achieve bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2 by optimizing the carrier doping techniques 
or modifying the optimal doping level (band structure) by changing the spacer layer 
structures.  
In conclusion, we have discovered a new type of BiS2-based superconductor 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 with a Tc as high as 10.6 K. This superconductor has a layered structure 
analogous to the BiS2-based Bi4O4S3 superconductor, suggesting that the BiS2 layer is a basic 
structure which provides new layered superconducting family like CuO2 plane of cuprates and 
Fe2An2 layers of Fe-based family. Furthermore, we note that the spacer layer of LaOBiS2 is 
almost the same as that of LaOFeAs, which is the first FeAs-based system. Thus, we will be 
able to discover many BiS2-based superconductors on the basis of the analogy to FeAs-based 
compounds. We expect that the novel superconductors with the BiS2 superconducting layers 
will open a new field in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.
