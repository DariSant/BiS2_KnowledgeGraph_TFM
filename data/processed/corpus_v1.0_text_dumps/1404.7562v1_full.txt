Abstract 
The layered compound LaOBiSSe was successfully synthesized by a two-step 
solid-state reaction method, which is isostructural with the quaternary compound 
LaOBiS2 indicated by the powder X-ray diffraction characterization, and the crystal 
lattice parameters are slightly expanded by the substitution of Se atoms. Electrical 
transport measurement shows that LaOBiSSe exhibits semiconducting behavior 
similar with the parent compound LaOBiS2, while by F-doping the samples can be 
much more easily turned to be metallic and superconducting at low temperature with 
a small amount of F. Under the optimal carrier doping concentration of F ~ 0.5, the 
superconducting critical temperature of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is clearly enhanced up to a 
value of 3.8 K than the 3.2 K of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2.

1. Introduction 
Chemical compounds with layered crystal structure are of great interest in the 
exploration for novel superconductors, and two types of high critical temperature 
(high-Tc) superconductivity have been found in copper oxides and iron pnictides that 
both possess layered lattices [1-2], in which the low dimensionality results in strong 
electronic correlation which is believed to enhance the unconventional  high-Tc 
superconductivity. Recently some BiS2-based layered compounds were reported to be 
superconducting at low temperatures, such as Bi4O4S3, LnO1-xFxBiS2 (Ln = lanthanide 
elements) and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 etc. [3-27]. The crystal structures of all these 
superconductors are generally composed of alternative stacking BiS2-type layers and 
other insulating blocking layers, and the BiS2-layers are believed to be responsible for 
the occurrence of superconductivity. For the typical LaOBiS2 type quaternary 
compound which resembles a similar crystal structure with the iron-based LaOFeAs 
high-Tc superconductors, superconductivity can be realized through electron-carrier 
doping by F- at the O2- atomic site, or Ti4+ at the La3+ site, and the superconducting 
transition temperature Tc is usually around 3 K in samples synthesized from common 
solid state reaction method [4-5]. While interestingly, this Tc can be dramatically 
increased up to around 10 K in samples synthesized by a high-pressure annealing 
method, or in samples measured under a high pressure around 1 GPa [6-10]. The 
enhancement of superconductivity mainly comes from the compression of the crystal 
structures in both cases, which indicates that structural modulation changes the 
superconducting Tc significantly in this new BiS2-based superconducting family.  
Except for the physical pressure effect which always reduces the crystal lattices, 
chemical substitution with isovalent elements is another conventional method for 
structural modulation that is often used to modulate the superconducting Tc, and the 
crystal lattice can be either compressed or expanded by using isovalent elements with 
different atomic radius. A successful case is the Sm substitution for La in the 
SmFeAsO1-xFx superconductor, which leads to a significant increase of Tc from 26 K 
to 55 K [28]. In this study, the substitution with a larger atom of Se for S is used for 
structural modulation in the newly found LaOBiS2 superconductor. The LaOBiSSe 
compound was successfully synthesized with a larger lattice, and superconductivity 
with a higher Tc was achieved by F-doping.

2. Experimental 
The F-doped polycrystalline LaOBiSSe and LaOBiS2 samples were synthesized by 
a two-step solid state reaction method. At first, La2S3, La2Se3, Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 were 
pre-sintered from La, Bi, S, and Se powders sealed in evacuated quartz tubes at 800 
oC for 12 hours, and these compounds were ground into powders for later use. Then 
the fine powders of La2O3, La2S3, La2Se3, Bi2S3, Bi2Se3, Bi, and LaF3 were mixed 
together according to the nominal stoichiometric ratio of LaO1-xFxBiSSe (or LaO1-
xFxBiS2), ground thoroughly in an agate mortar and pressed into small pellets. All the 
preparation processes were carried out in an argon protected glove box. The pellets 
were sealed into evacuated quartz tubes and heated at 800 oC for 50 hours followed by 
furnace cooling. The obtained samples were hard and black in color. 
The samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) method on a 
PAN-analytical x-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation from 20o to 80o at room 
temperature for crystal structure determination and phase analysis. The temperature 
dependence of resistivity was measured by the standard four-probe method using a 
PPMS system (Physical Property Measurement System, Quantum Design). The 
temperature dependence of DC magnetic susceptibility was measured during warming 
cycle by both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) method under an 
applied field of 10 Oe using an MPMS system (Magnetic Property Measurement 
System, Quantum Design).   
 
3. Results and discussion 
In Fig.1 the powder XRD patterns of all the prepared BiSSe-based samples of 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe with x = 0 - 0.7 were plotted, together with the patterns of BiS2-based 
samples of LaOBiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 for structural comparison. The main 
reflection peaks of all patterns can be well indexed with the reported CeOBiS2 type 
tetragonal crystal structure with the space group P4/nmm. By F-doping at the oxygen 
site, minor impurity phases of Bi2Se3, Bi2O3 can be observed. And the ratio of these 
impurity phases increases with the F-doping content x, which indicates that fluorine 
cannot be fully doped at the O-site, and the real F-doping level is a little smaller than 
the nominal one. The existence of impurity phases is mainly due to the loss of fluorine

during the high temperature reaction, which breaks the chemical stoichiometry, 
similar with the F-doping in iron oxypnictides. For the undoped LaOBiSSe phase, the 
refined lattice parameters are a = 4.118 Å and c = 14.133 Å, which are both much 
larger than those of LaOBiS2, for which a = 4.062 Å and c = 13.858 Å. This lattice 
expansion comes from the larger Se atomic radius than the S atom. The separation of 
the (102) and (004) peaks is a typical feature for F-doped LaOBiS2 samples, which 
also happens for the F-doped LaOBiSSe compound as shown in the right panel of Fig. 
1. Clearly, the F-doping at the O-site causes the crystal lattice of LaOBiSSe to shrink 
significantly along the c-axis, which can be seen from the obvious right shift of the 
(004) peaks for the doped samples. The nearly unchanged positions of the (110) peaks 
indicate little variation of the tetragonal crystal structure along a-axis.  
The temperature dependence of resistivity for all samples was measured from 2 K 
to 300 K to study the electron-doping induced superconductivity, and the data are 
shown in Fig. 2. For the two BiS2-based samples, the resistivity curves show 
semiconducting-like behavior at normal state within the measured temperature range, 
and the F-doped  LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (optimal-doping) shows an onset superconducting 
transition at Tc ~ 3.2 K, these results are similar as reported data [4-5]. For the BiSSe-
based samples, the curve of undoped LaOBiSSe shows a similar semiconducting 
behavior, while all the curves of F-doped samples (from x = 0.1 ~ 0.7) show metallic 
behavior at normal state, and almost linear temperature dependence between 50 K ~ 
300 K, with sudden superconducting transitions at lower temperatures, these 
characteristics are obviously different from the BiS2-based samples, which indicates 
the replacement of S by Se atom has a clear change on the Fermi level electronic 
structure, and makes the samples more metallic and much easier to be 
superconducting. The onset of Tc increases with F-doping content x, and exceeds the 
one of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 when x = 0.3, and reaches a maximum Tc ~ 3.8 K for the 
sample with the nominal composition of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, then slowly decreases with 
further F-doping. These results indicate that the LaOBiSSe is much easier to be turned 
metallic by electron doping, and superconductivity is enhanced in the LaOBiSSe 
compound by F-doping than in the LaOBiS2 compound. 
The temperature dependence of DC magnetic susceptibility for the superconducting 
samples of LaO1-xFxBiSSe (x = 0.3 - 0.7) was also measured in order to confirm the 


 
5 
 
bulk nature of the superconducting behavior. Fig. 4 shows the susceptibility data 
between the temperature range of 2 K ~ 6 K measured with both field-cooling (FC) 
and zero-field-cooling (ZFC) methods at a magnetic field of 10 Oe. The diamagnetic 
transition clearly indicates the occurrence of superconductivity. The estimated 
superconducting shielding volume fraction from ZFC data is close to 33% for the 
sample with x = 0.4, which is similar with the F-doped LaOBiS2 superconductors. 
The onset of the magnetic Tc increases with increasing F content x, and reaches the 
highest of Tc ~ 3.7 K for the samples of x = 0.4 and 0.5, then decreases with further 
increasing x. This doping behavior is consistent with the F-doped LaOBiS2 
superconductors but with an enhanced Tc. 
To further elucidate the effect of F-doping and structure modulation in the 
LaOBiSSe compound, the lattice parameters ‘a’ and ‘c’ of all samples were refined 
from the XRD patterns and plotted in Fig. 4(a), and the onset Tc determined from 
resistivity vs. the nominal F-content x was plotted in Fig. 4(b). It can be seen that with 
the increase of x, the crystal structure has a large shrinkage along the c-axis but little 
change along a-axis. When x > 0.4, the shrinking along c-axis becomes slower; this 
indicates that the doping becomes difficult when the F concentration increases, and 
the real doping level is smaller than the nominal x. This is consistent with that the 
ratio of impurity phases increases as x increases. The onset Tc also rises quickly with 
the F-content x, while after x > 0.4, the change of Tc becomes slower. The optimal 
doping level is at x = 0.5 with a Tc ~ 3.8K, after that, the Tc starts to decrease with 
more F-doping. 
Here we note that the Se-substitution was independently studied in the layered 
Bi4O4S3 superconductor which suppresses the superconductivity [29], and the fully 
Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductor was also reported with a lower onset Tc 
of 2.6 K [30]. Therefore the enhancement of superconductivity in this LaOBiSSe 
compound is quite interesting and worth to be further studied. 
4. Conclusions 
In summary, a layered compound LaOBiSSe was synthesized by solid-state 
reaction method. By F-doping at the O site which induces electron carriers, this 
compound can be much easily turned into superconducting with a higher Tc than the 


 
6 
 
F-doped LaOBiS2 superconductors. The F-doping effect was systematically studied, 
which introduce electron carriers and causes lattice shrinkage mainly along the c-axis 
of the crystal lattice, and lead to a highest Tc of 3.8 K in the optimally doped 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe superconductor.
