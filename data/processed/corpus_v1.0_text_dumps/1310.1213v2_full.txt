Abstract 
F-substituted ROBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Nd) superconducting single crystals with different 
F concentration were grown successfully using CsCl/KCl flux. All the obtained single 
crystals had a plate-like shape with a well-developed ab-plane of 1-2 mm in size. The 
flux components of Cs, K, and Cl were not detected in the obtained single crystals by 
electron probe microanalysis. The grown single crystals of F-substituted LaOBiS2 and 
CeOBiS2 showed superconducting at about 3 K while the Tc of the F-substituted 
NdOBiS2 exhibited approximately 5 K. The superconducting anisotropy of the single 
crystals of F-substituted LaOBiS2 and NdOBiS2 was estimated to be 30-45 according to 
the effective mass model whereas those values were 13-21 for the F-substituted 
CeOBiS2 single crystals. The F-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals exhibited magnetic 
order at about 7 K that apparently coexisted with superconductivity below around 3 K.

1. Introduction 
The discovery of the BiS2-based superconductors, Bi4O4S3 [1] and RO1-zFzBiS2 (R = 
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) [2-6], has attracted a great interest as new superconductors. The 
substitution of F for O in these materials are important for the appearance of 
superconductivity by inducing carriers in superconducting layers. However, the 
investigation of these superconductors has faced problems of the lack of single crystals. 
Very recently, we have reported the growth of single crystal of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 by 
CsCl/KCl flux in vacuum and its intrinsic transport properties [7]. This successful 
growth of the single crystal using CsCl/KCl flux motivates us to grow other BiS2-based 
single crystals. It is highly desirable to grow the single crystals with various 
compositions in order to investigate the effect of different rare earth elements and F 
contents in F-substituted ROBiS2 on their intrinsic properties.  
In this paper, we grew F-substituted ROBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Nd) single crystals with 
different F concentration by using CsCl/KCl flux. The composition and transport 
properties were examined to understand intrinsic properties of these materials, and we

discussed the effect of rare earth elements and F substitution.  
 
2. Experimental 
Single crystals of F-substituted ROBiS2 (R:La,Ce,Nd) were grown by a 
high-temperature flux method in a vacuumed quartz tube. The raw materials were R2S3, 
Bi, Bi2S3, Bi2O3, BiF3, CsCl, and KCl. The synthesis and characterization procedures 
followed the previous literature except the amount of CsCl/KCl flux [7]. The raw 
materials were weighed with a nominal composition of RO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0-1.0). The 
mixture of the raw materials (0.8 g) and CsCl/KCl flux (5.0 g) were mixed using a 
mortar, and sealed in a quartz tube in vacuum. The molar ratio of the CsCl/KCl flux was 
CsCl:KCl = 5:3. The mixed powder was heated at 800 °C for 10 h, cooled slowly to 
600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, and then furnace-cooled down to room temperature. The 
quartz tube was opened in air atmosphere, and the flux was solved into distilled water in 
the quartz tube. The product was filtered, and washed with distilled water. The crystal 
structure and composition of the single crystals were evaluated by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) analysis using CuKα radiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and 
electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The transport properties of the single crystals 
were measured by the standard four-probe method with constant current mode using a 


 
5
Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design; PPMS DynaCool). The 
electrical terminals were made by silver paste. We measured the angular (θ) dependence 
of resistivity (ρ) in the flux liquid state under various magnetic fields (H) and calculated 
the superconducting anisotropy (γs) using the effective mass model [8-10]. The 
temperature dependence of magnetization (M) under zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field 
cooling (FC) was measured by a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) 
magnetometer with an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the ab-plane.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of the F-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystal. The 
synthesized single crystals had a plate-like shape of 1.0-2.0 mm in size and 10-20 μm in 
thickness. The in-plane orientation of the grown crystals was not measured. Figure 2 
shows the XRD pattern of a well-developed plane of the F-substituted CeOBiS2 single 
crystal grown from the starting powder with a nominal composition of CeO0.7F0.3BiS2. 
The peak positions of the grown single crystals agree with those of 00l diffraction peaks 
of F-substituted CeOBiS2 in the previous literature [3]. The presence of only 00l 
diffraction peaks of the CeOBiS2 structure indicates the well-developed ab-plane.  
Table I shows the effect of the F composition in the starting materials on the F 


 
6
composition of the grown single crystals, the lattice parameter of c-axis and 
superconducting anisotropy (γs) in the single crystals. The F composition, which is 
normalized by total of the F and O compositions, in the starting materials and in the 
single crystals are defined as x and y, respectively. The single crystals were obtained 
only in the range of x between 0.3 and 0.9. The chemical ratio of R:Bi:S in the grown 
crystals determined to be 1.01±0.05:0.99±0.05:2.00 by EPMA, and the ratio agreed with 
the stoichiometric ratio. The obtained values were normalized using S = 2.00. Nd and Bi 
were measured to a precision of two decimal places. No Cs, K, and Cl were detected in 
the grown single crystals by EPMA with a minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 wt%. With 
increasing the F composition x in the starting materials, the F composition y in the 
single crystals increased and saturated to 0.46 (R = La), 0.66 (R = Ce) and 0.38 (R = 
Nd) at x ≥ 0.7. Although the analytical values of F composition y in the grown single 
crystals of x = 0.7 and 0.9 are consistent within analytical error, the physical properties 
of these crystals are different each other as described later. The increase of x in the 
starting materials shortened the lattice parameters but gave the almost same values at x 
≥ 0.7. The minimum c-axis lattice parameter is about 13.4 Å regardless of rare earth 
metals. Figure 3 showed the 004 diffraction peaks of the F-substituted ROBiS2 (R:La, 
Ce, Nd) single crystals. The peak position shifted toward high angle with increasing the 


 
7
value of x, and this result suggests the increase of c-axis lattice parameters as shown in 
Table I.  
Figure 4 showed the temperature dependence of resistivities in the single crystals of 
F-substituted ROBiS2 (R:La, Ce, Nd) at 2-10 K. The similar trends were observed in the 
single crystals of F-substituted LaOBiS2 and CeOBiS2. While these LaOBiS2 and 
CeOBiS2 crystals for x = 0.3 did not exhibit zero resistivity down to 2 K, those for x = 
0.7 and 0.9 showed superconducting transition temperature (Tc) about 3 K. The 
transport properties of the single crystals for x = 0.3, 0.7 and 0.9 showed 
semiconducting behavior, but LaOBiS2 for x = 0.9 became metallic. Only in the single 
crystals of CeOBiS2, the increase of x from 0.7 to 0.9 significantly suppressed Tc though 
the value of y in the crystals was almost same. The origin of this difference is unclear 
and further examination is needed. On the other hand, F-substituted NdOBiS2 crystals 
for x = 0.3, 0.7 and 0.9 were superconductor with Tc of approximately 5 K, and all the 
single crystals showed metallic behavior. The resistivities of normal state seems 
independent over x and y values. This may be attributed to the increase of surface 
roughness. We could observe the rough surface of these crystals to the naked eyes when 
we compared with the surface of F-substituted LaOBiS2 and CeOBiS2 single crystals. 
The broad transition for x = 0.7 might be due to the low crystallinity.

The angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) was measured at different magnetic fields 
(H) in the flux liquid state to estimate the superconducting anisotropy (γs) of grown 
F-substituted ROBiS2 single crystals, as reported in Refs. 8 and 9. The reduced field 
(Hred) is calculated using the following equation for the effective mass model:  
Hred = H(sin2θ+γs
-2cos2θ)1/2                   (1) 
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field [10]. Hred is calculated 
from H and θ. The superconducting anisotropy (γs) was estimated from the best scaling 
for the ρ-Hred relations. Figure 5 displays the angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) at 
different magnetic fields (H = 0.1-5.0 or 0.1-9.0 T) in the flux liquid state for the 
synthesized single crystals of (a) F-substituted LaOBiS2 grown from the starting 
materials of x = 0.9, y = 0.46 and (b) F-substituted CeOBiS2 for x = 0.7, y = 0.65. The 
ρ-θ curve exhibited twofold symmetry. Figure 6 shows the ρ-Hred scaling obtained from 
the ρ-θ curves in Fig. 5 using Eq. (1). The scaling was performed by taking γs = 45 and 
γs = 16, shown in Fig. 6 (a) and (b), respectively. Table I shows the summary of the 
superconducting anisotropy of F-substituted ROBiS2 single crystals with various x 
ratios in the starting materials and y ratio of the grown single crystals. While the γs of R 
= La and Nd were estimated to be 30-45, the values of R = Ce became lower values of 
13-21. Figure 7 exhibits the temperature dependence of magnetization for the obtained 


 
9
F-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals for (a) x = 0.3, y =0.53, (b) x = 0.7, y = 0.65 and 
(c) x = 0.9, y = 0.66 in the starting materials. The magnetic transitions (Tm) were only 
observed in the superconducting crystals for x = 0.7 and 0.9, and their temperature were 
above Tc. The appearance of this magnetic transition in the single crystals agrees with 
that in the polycrystals with similar compositions [3,6], and gives the evidence that this 
magnetic transition is their intrinsic property. Further characterization of these single 
crystals is needed for the investigation of this origin.  
 
4. Conclusions 
We succeeded the growth of F-substituted ROBiS2 (R: La,Ce,Nd) single crystals by 
using CsCl/KCl flux with different rare earth metals and F substituted contents. The 
increase of F contents in the starting materials enhanced substituted values of F in the 
single crystals, but the further increase from 70 % in the starting materials gave the 
maximum substituted values in the single crystals. These maximum substituted values 
in the single crystals depended on different rare earth elements. The transport properties 
of the obtained single crystals were investigated. While their superconducting 
anisotropies (γs) of the single crystals of RO1-yFyBiS2 (R:La,Nd y = 0.23-0.46) were 
estimated to be 30-45, that of R = Ce (y = 0.53-0.66) became lower values of 13-21. The 


 
10
F-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals exhibited magnetic order at about 7 K in addition 
to the superconducting transition at approximately 3 K. Further investigation of 
obtained single crystals is needed for the origin of these exceptional properties.
