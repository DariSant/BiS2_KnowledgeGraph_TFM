We report suppression of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 compound by Se doping at S site.  
Bulk polycrystalline samples are synthesized by solid state reaction route. The Rietveld refined 
of XRD data of all the studied samples show that the same are crystallized in tetragonal I4/mmm 
space group with slightly increased c lattice constant with the Se doping. Superconductivity is 
observed at below 4.5 K in both dc magnetization and resistivity with temperature measurements 
for all Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples, though the same is decreased slightly 
with increase in Se content. The upper critical field of the Bi4O4S3 is estimated from resistivity 
under magnetic field [ρ(T)H] measurements of up to 2T (Tesla), and the same decreases for Se 
doped samples. The flux flow activation energies being obtained by fitting to the the Arrhenius 
equation are 18.60 meV for Bi4O4S3 , 13.69 meV for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03 and 13.16 meV for 
Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15 samples in applied magnetic field of 200 Oe. In conclusion the S site Se 
substitution showed detrimental effect on superconductivity of Bi4O4S3.

Introduction 
 
 
The discovery of superconductivity with superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 
around 4.5K in Bi4O4S3 [1, 2] with tetragonal I4/mmm structure has generated tremendous 
interest among condensed matter scientific community. The novel BiS2 based superconductor 
consists of a layered crystal structure built from BiS2 layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1−x block layers, 
where x indicates the deficiency of SO4
2- ions at interlayer sites [3]. Within few weeks, several 
other BiS2-based superconductors, with composition ReO1−xFxBiS2 (Re = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) [4-7] 
appeared, with Tc as high as 10 K. Evidently, these compounds have a common BiS2 layer, which 
serves as the basic building blocks of this new superconducting family. The carrier doping 
mechanism in the new BiS2 based superconductors is seemingly the same as for the high Tc 
cuprates and Fe-Pnictides [4-10].  There are some doubts about the exact crystal structure and 
superconducting composition of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor [8]. A recent extensive study of 
these compounds showed that Bi4O4S3 is actually a two-phased material [9]. The two phases are 
namely Bi2OS2 and Bi3O2S3 and most likely the later one exhibits the superconductivity. 
Theoretical studies indicated that the Fermi level lies within the conduction bands, which are 
originating from the Bi 6p orbitals in the BiS2 layer [11-13]. Also exotic multi-band behavior has 
been reported in the Hall coefficient measurements and it is shown that the charge carriers are 
mainly electron-type [14]. The chemical doping in the main phase of these superconducting 
compounds could be a powerful way to increase their Tc and to understand possible mechanism 
of superconductivity. In one report, Ag has been doped in Bi4O4S3 compound and it is shown 
that the lattice shrinks gradually with Ag doping and the Tc is suppressed [15].

Keeping in view that there exists only scant reports [15] on the on-site substitution in 
Bi4O4S3, we report here the effect of Se substitution at S site in bulk polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex 
(x=0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15). All the studied samples are crystallized in near single phase and the 
superconductivity is seen to decrease with increase in Se content. For higher (x > 0.15) content 
of Se in Bi4O4S3-xSex, the resultant material becomes clearly multi phase and the on-site 
substitution was not possible. It is shown that, Se doping at S site has detrimental effect on 
superconductivity of Bi4O4S3.     
Experimental 
 
Polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples are synthesized by 
standard solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Bi, S, Bi2O3, and Se are 
weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon 
atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in a 
quartz tube. Sealed quartz ampoules are placed in Box furnace and heat treated at 4000C for 10h 
with the typical heating rate of 2oC/minute, and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of 
six hours to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was 
performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-60o in equal 2θ step of 
0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed 
using the standard FullProf program. The electrical transport and magnetization measurements 
were performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) as a 
function of both temperature and applied magnetic field. 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refined XRD patterns at a room temperature for Bi4O4S3-xSex 
(x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples. Reported Wyckoff positions [2] and space group I4/mmm 
with the tetragonal structure are used to refine the XRD pattern. Some impurities of Bi and Bi2S3 
are also seen in the main phase of the Bi4O4S3. The content of Bi2S3 phase slightly increases with 
increase in Se content. The refined lattice constants of Bi4O4S3 are a = 3.9708(2) Ǻ and c = 
41.357(1) Ǻ, and the same slightly increases to a = 3.9717(1) Ǻ and c = 41.419(3) Ǻ for x = 0.15 
sample. It is clear from XRD data the lattice slightly expands due to bigger ion Se doping at S 
site.  
 
Temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibility (M-T) data under 10 Oe magnetic field 
for the studied Bi4O4S3-xSex samples are shown in Figure 2(a). Magnetization measurements are 
performed in both ZFC (Zero Field Cool) and FC (Field Cool) modes. Clear diamagnetic 
transitions are seen at around 4.4 K for Bi4O4S3, 4.2 K for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, 3.7 K for 
Bi4O4S2.91Se0.09, and 3.5 K for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that though all studied samples show 
superconductivity, but the Tc is decreasing with increasing Se doping level. Below Tc, the 
bifurcation of the FC and ZFC data is simply due to the complicated magnetic flux pinning 
effects. Both the FC and ZFC magnetization data confirmed the appearance of bulk 
superconductivity in Bi4O4S3-xSex samples. Figure 2(b), represents the AC magnetic 
susceptibility of the Bi4O4S3 sample, confirming the bulk superconductivity at around 4.5 K. The 
AC magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out at 333 Hz and varying 
amplitude of 5 - 13 Oe. It can be seen from Fig. 2b, that the imaginary part peak height is 
increased along with increased diamagnetism in real part of AC susceptibility with change in 
amplitude from 5-13 Oe. The interesting part is that with increasing AC amplitude the imaginary 


3 
 
part peak position temperature (4.5 K) is not changed. This indicates, that the superconducting 
grains are well coupled and hence nearly no grain boundary contribution in the superconductivity 
of Bi4O4S3. Inset of the Fig. 2b depicts the Real part of AC susceptibility being measured at 
applied DC bias fields of up to 4 kOe at temperature 2 K. The upper critical field (Hc2) being 
determined from in-field AC susceptibility measurements, is 0.5 kOe and 1.973 kOe with 50% 
and 90% diamagnetism criteria, respectively.  
The Resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) plots for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 
0.15) samples in zero magnetic field are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen from the ρ-T plots that 
resistivity increases slightly with increasing of Se doping. All samples showed 
superconductivity, with Tc
onset of 4.5 K for Bi4O4S3 and 4.0 K for the x = 0.15. This indicates that 
the superconductivity is suppressed with the Se doping in the Bi4O4S3-xSex compounds. It is clear 
indication that the superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 compound is not due to Bi impurity. This is 
because the Bi content is fixed for all samples and the substitution is done only at S site. Inset of 
the Figure 3 shows the temperature dependent resistivity in expanded temperature range of 300 - 
2.2 K. It can be seen that the all samples exhibit metallic behavior with slightly increasing 
resistivity for Se doped compounds.  
Figure 4 (a), (b), and (c) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity under applied 
magnetic field for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples. Superconductivity is seen at 
below 4.5K for pristine Bi4O4S3 and the same decreases with Se doping. With increasing applied 
magnetic field, though both the Tc
onset and Tc (ρ = 0) are gradually shifted to lower temperatures, 
but the shift is comparatively more for the later. This results in broadening of the 
superconducting transition under applied field, which is similar to the high-Tc layered cuprates 
and Fe-pnictide superconductors [16, 17]. Figure 5 exhibits the temperature dependent of upper 
critical field (Hc2) for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples.  The Hc2 is evaluated by using 
resistivity drops to 90% of its normal state value i.e., ρn(T,H) at above Tc
onset. The conventional 
one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation Hc2(0) = − 0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc has 
been used to evaluate Hc2. Thus calculated upper critical field Hc2
WHH(0) is 2.3 Tesla for Bi4O4S3,  
2.1 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, and 1.8 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that the Hc2 is 
decreasing with increase in Se doping concentration. The temperature derivative of resistivity 
(dρ/dT) for the three superconducting samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) are shown in 
Fig. 6 (a), (b) and (c) respectively. Though dρ/dT peak is broadened with field yet only a single 
transition peak is observed, suggesting better grains coupling in these systems. The broadening 
of the resistive transition under applied magnetic field can be seen in terms of dissipation energy 
caused by the motion of vortices in the mixed state. This suggests that superconducting onset is 
relatively less affected than the Tc (ρ = 0) state. The transition broadening is caused by the creep 
of vortices, which are thermally activated. The temperature dependence of resistivity in this 
region is governed by Arrhenius equation [18], 
ρ(T,B) = ρ0 exp[- U0/kBT]                           
(1) 
Here, ρ0 is the field independent pre-exponential factor, kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and U0 is 
thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) activation energy. Activation energy can be obtained from 
the fitted low temperature resistivity data with the Arrhenius equation. Figs. 7(a), (b) and (c) 
show the experimental data in terms of ln(ρ) vs. T-1 along with the fitting to equation 1. The best 
fitted data give values of the activation energies to be 18.60 meV for Bi4O4S3, 13.69 meV for 
Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03 and 13.16 meV for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15 samples in applied magnetic field of 200 Oe. 
In low field region, though the activation energy shows weak dependence i.e. U0/kB ~ H-0.35, but 


4 
 
is strongly dependent in high field range as U0/kB ~ H-0.85, it could be clearly seen that the field 
dependence of U0 is different for lower and higher field ranges. This has been observed earlier 
for some other superconductors as well [16, 17]. In summery we have synthesized near single 
phase bulk polycrystalline samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) compounds and it is 
found that the S site Se doping deteriorates superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 system.
