The BiS2-based superconductors were discovered recently1-2. The 
superconductivity has been proved by many other groups3-10. Since the previous 
experiments were all done on polycrystalline samples, therefore there remains a 
concern whether the superconductivity is really derived from the materials 
intrinsically or from some secondary phases11. Experiments on single crystals are 
highly desired. In this paper, we report the successful growth of the 
NdO1-xFxBi1-yS2 single crystals. Resistive and magnetic measurements reveal that

the bulk superconducting transition occurs at about 5 K, while an unexpected 
giant superconducting fluctuation appears at temperatures as high as 2-4 kBTC.

=16.8, the larger gap remains up to about 26 K. The 
normal state recovered by applying a high magnetic field shows an anomalous 
semiconducting behavior. All these suggest that the superconductivity in this 
newly discovered superconductor cannot be formatted into the BCS theory.    
 
In the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, the electron pairing and condensation 
occur simultaneously at Tc. The superconducting fluctuation may extend to above Tc in a very 
narrow region (less than 10% Tc)12. Therefore it is a surprise that the superconducting 
fluctuation appears at temperatures far above Tc in the cuprates13-16. In some thin but dirty 
metallic films, people were pursuing a man-made wide superconducting fluctuation region in 
terms of the Cooper pair gas state17-18. In addition, in the BCS scheme, the normal state after 
the superconductivity is suppressed should show a metallic behavior. Any semiconducting or 
insulating behavior appearing in the normal state should have its special reasons. Within the 
weak electron-phonon coupling BCS picture, one has

superconducting gap. This ratio can be slightly higher in the conventional superconductors 
with strong coupling, but can reach about 8 in the cuprates19.  In this paper we will show that 


 
3 
all three features mentioned above for the BCS scheme will be violated in the newly 
discovered superconductor NdO1-xFxBi1-yS2 single crystal samples.   
The single crystals NdO1-xFxBi1-yS2 were grown using flux method with KCl/LiCl as the 
flux. The details about the sample growth are given in Methods. The crystals are very shiny 
with the dark-grey color. In Fig.1b, we show the Laue diffraction pattern on one crystal. The 
clear and symmetric spots can be well fitted to the model calculations of crystallography, 
indicating high quality of the crystals. From the data of Laue diffraction pattern, we can 
determine the in-plane crystalline axes, which is very helpful for the precise in-plane resistive 
measurements. In Fig.1c, we show the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the samples 
grown with different nominal concentrations of fluorine. It is clear that only (00l) reflections 
can be observed yielding a c-axis lattice constant c = 13.49±0.04 Å. In Fig.1d, we show a 
picture 
of 
one 
crystal 
on 
which 
the 
composition 
is 
analyzed 
using 
the 
energy-dispersion-spectrum (EDS). From the EDS data, one can see that our crystal has a 
formula like NdO1-xFxBi0.84S1.94. Since the oxygen and fluorine are both light elements, the 
value given here about them are not reliable, although the nominal compositions of them are 
well documented. We found that the samples with the nominal fluorine concentration less 
than 30% are not or bad superconductive. Due to the error bars of the EDS measurements, we 
can conclude that the composition of sulfur here is close to 2, but Bi is slightly deficient. We 
have done the EDS analysis on about 20 crystals, the results are quite convergent and given in 
the Supplementary Information.  
In Fig.2a and 2b, we present a typical set of resistive data measured at zero and different 
magnetic fields with the configurations of: (a) H||c-axis⊥I and (b) H||I||a-axis with the 


 
4 
current always flowing along a-axis. The inset in Fig.1a gives the DC magnetization 
transition measured at H = 1 Oe. Interestingly the superconductivity is strongly suppressed by 
the magnetic field when the field is along c-axis, but quite robust with an in-plane field. When 
H||c-axis, the bulk superconductivity can be easily suppressed down to 2 K with only a field 
of 0.6 T. However, the superconductivity is very robust with H||a-axis and keeps presence 
above 2 K when the field is up to 9 T. We extract the resistive data between 20-30 K down to 
low temperature region as the normal state value ρn(T), and use the different criterions of 50%, 
90% and 98%ρn for determining the upper critical field Hc2(T). The data are shown in Fig.2d. 
One can see that the Hc2(T) determined with above three different criterions are quite different 
for the cases of H||c⊥I and H||I||a. From these data, one can determine the anisotropy by

, the 
resistivity measured at different magnetic fields but at a fixed temperature should be scalable  
to one curve21. In Fig.3a, b and c, we show the angle dependence of the in-plane resistivity at 
3, 3.5 and 4 K. Now the measuring current is flowing along a-axis, the magnetic field is 
always perpendicular to the current direction. Fig.3d presents the scaling behavior according 
to above mentioned method. One can see that the scaling quality looks quite good for all three 
temperatures 3, 3.5 and 4 K, yielding the anisotropy of 36, 31 and 30 respectively. Therefore 
we can safely conclude that the anisotropy of this new superconducting system is about 
30-45. 
Another interesting discovery on the single crystals is the giant superconducting 
fluctuation effect. In Fig.2a, if we extrapolate the resistivity curve between 20-30 K linearly 
down to low temperatures, one can see an enhanced excess conductivity clearly above Tc. To 
illustrate this, in inset of Fig.2b, we present the difference of the resistivity between the 
measured

, with σ, σn and ∆σ the measured, extrapolated and 
the excess conductivity, respectively. It is clear that the resistivity difference vanishes at about 


 
6 
15 K. In Fig.2c, we show the resistivity curve on another sample, it is clear that the 
superconducting fluctuating region extends up to about 20 K, as marked by
*
T
. 
In order to check whether we really have a strong superconducting fluctuation, we 
measured the in-plane resistivity with a rotating in-plane magnetic field. The measuring 
current is along a- (or b-) axis, and the sample is rotated with an in-plane magnetic field. The 
angle enclosed between the current direction and the magnetic field is φ. When φ=0=π, the 
Lorenz force on the vortices is zero and thus the dissipation is the minimum, while it becomes 
maximum with φ=π/2=3π/2. Interestingly the same two fold oscillations appear from 4 K all 
the way up to 10 K. At 4K, we have strong reason to believe that the vortex motion dominates 
the dissipation.  From the systematic evolution from 4 K to 10 K, we think that the 2-fold 
resistivity oscillation is still induced by the vortex motion, even at 10 K. This leads to the 
conclusion that the superconducting fluctuation exists at least up to 10 K from the angle 
dependent resistive data, although the bulk transition occurs at Tc = 5K. 
In order to further unravel the superconductivity in the sample, we have measured the 
scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on the single crystals. The measurements were done 
with a commercial instrument Unisoku-11T with ultra-high vacuum system. The single 
crystals were cleaved under an ultra-high vacuum then followed by the measurements at a 
low temperature down to 0.4 K. The details of the measurements and results are given in 
Methods. One typical set of data measured at temperatures from 0.4 to 26 K is shown in 
Fig.5a. One can see that, the data measured at low temperatures exhibit clearly two sets of 
energy gaps, one small gap

 meV. The 
small gap is marked by the dashed red line in Fig.5b. Interestingly, at the bias voltage of the 


 
7 
small gap, two coherence peaks appear at about 3.5 meV and gradually disappear at about 6 K. 
Therefore we can conclude that this small gap seems corresponding to the bulk 
superconducting transition at around 5 K. This feature can be easily observed in the STS with 
the data normalized by that at 8 K and shown in Fig.5c. As shown in Fig.5b, the larger gap, 
however, shows up as the energy features at about 7.5±1 meV at low temperatures, and as a 
suppression to the deferential conductance (dI/dV) or the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) 
at temperatures above 8 K. This feature can extend to high temperatures and gradually 
vanishes at about 26 K. One can naturally connect this larger gap to the giant superconducting 
fluctuations in the resistive measurements. 
In the resistive data shown in Fig.2a, one can see that the normal state reveals a 
semiconducting behavior when superconductivity is completely suppressed. Similar 
phenomenon was observed and emphasized in the polycrystalline CeO1-xFxBiS2 samples 
previously5,6. This is anti-intuitive to the BCS picture, since a metallic state should be 
recovered in the normal state. One may argue that this semiconducting behavior is induced by 
the localization effect of electrons in the low dimensional system as derived from the band 
structure calculations22,23. This scheme is however also not workable here. For a low 
dimensional system, impurities may induce a semiconducting behavior due to the localization 
effect, the magnetic field will weaken this localization effect and the semiconducting feature. 
While our observation is that, when the superconductivity is suppressed, the semiconducting 
feature above Tc shows up. In addition, the magnetic field seems enhancing this 
semiconducting effect in a certain field region. Another possibility is the possible Kondo-like 
scattering which will induce a semiconducting behavior. This explanation can also be 


 
8 
excluded because we don’t have this type of strong magnetic impurities in the samples. In 
addition, the weakening effect of the semiconducting behavior by the magnetic field in a 
Kondo system is not observed here. For this low dimensional system, there is however a 
tendency for the charge-density-wave (CDW). When the superconductivity is suppressed, the 
CDW tendency will be promoted and lead to a semiconducting feature. While the interesting 
point is that, the “normal state” here above Tc ≈ 4.83 K at zero field seems not showing even a 
weak or negligible semiconducting effect. If it were induced by the CDW tendency, it would 
show out above Tc even the field is zero. Therefore this semiconducting feature of the normal 
state under a magnetic field is non-trivial and requires further input. 
From the STS measurements we observed two gap features at different energies. The 
smaller gap

about 5 K. Taking Tc = 4.83 K, the ratio

= 16.8! This is much larger than the 
theoretical value 3.5 in the weak coupling limit of the BCS model. If we use the upper

temperature, we have

=4.06, which is not far from the BCS value 3.5. This 
probably suggests that the superconducting pairing occurs at a high temperature (for example 
20 K). Because of the very low dimensionality, the superconducting fluctuation is very strong, 
and the bulk transition at about 5 K is actually corresponding to the phase coherence 
temperature. This gives strong resemblance to the case in cuprate superconductors. Following 
this line, the gap feature at

meV may be a pseudogap, which may be induced by 
the tendency of the CDW order, or by the local pairing governed by the valence fluctuation 
effect of the Bi2+ and Bi3+ ionic states24. If the latter mechanism is proved, this interesting 


 
9 
BiS2-based superconductor will provide us a new platform for the novel pairing mechanism of 
the valence fluctuation. The recent theoretical calculations suggest a significant band splitting 
due to the spin-orbital coupling effect in the BiS2 based superconductors23. In this case, one 
can expect a mixture of the spin singlet and spin triplet25 in the system. The clear violation of 
the predictions of the BCS picture for conventional superconductors observed in this work, 
i.e., the giant superconducting fluctuation, the huge gap feature and the unexpected 
semiconducting behavior after the superconductivity is suppressed, will certainly stimulate 
the enthusiasm of research in this newly discovered superconducting system, especially on 
single crystal samples26.     .    
           
 
Methods 
I. 
Sample growth 
The single crystals were grown by flux method using KCl/LiCl (molar ratio KCl : LiCl = 
3 : 2) as the flux. Firstly, the polycrystalline samples were grown by a solid-state reaction. In 
growing the polycrystalline samples, the starting materials Nd grains (purity 99.9%), NdF3 
(purity 99.9%), Nd2O3 (purity 99.9%), Bi2S3 (purity 99.9%) and S (purity 99.9%) were mixed 
in stoichiometry as the formula NdOxF1-xBiS2. Then we pressed the mixture into a pellet 
shape and sealed it in an evacuated quartz tube. It was heated up to 750°C for 10 hour. The 
resultant pellet was smashed and grounded together with KCl/LiCl powder of molar ratio 
(KCl/LiCl : NdO1-xFxBiS2 = 25 : 1) and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The mixed powder 
was heated up to 750°C for 5 days followed by cooling down at a rate of 5°C /hour to 450°C. 


 
10 
After the samples was cooled to room temperature by shutting off the power of the furnace, 
we used water to dissolve the flux and got single crystals with lateral sizes of about 1 mm and 
thickness of about 10-100 µm. 
 
II. STM measurements  
The scanning tunneling spectra (STS) were measured with an ultra-high vacuum, 
low-temperature, and high-magnetic-field scanning probe microscope USM-1300 (Unisoku Co., 
Ltd.). The samples were cleaved at room-temperature in ultra-high vacuum with a base pressure 
about 1×10-9  torr. The cleaved surfaces were always flat and shiny, and the atomically resolved 
image can be obtained sometimes. However the surfaces were unstable and the spectra showed a 
semiconductor behavior. This may be originated from the polar BiS top surface after the cleavage. 
The cleaved surfaces were then cleaned by argon iron bombardment with an acceleration voltage 
of 1500 V to get a more stable surface. We can obtain the superconducting spectra on such surface 
after the treatment. In all STM/STS measurements, Pt/Ir tips were used. To lower down the noise 
of the differential conductance spectra, a lock-in technique with an ac modulation of 1 mV at 
987.5 Hz was used.

Figure 5 | STS spectra for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal. a, The evolution of the STS 
spectra with temperature increased from 0.4 K to 26 K. In the low temperature region, we can 
see the superconducting coherence peaks emerging at about ±3.5(±0.3) meV and two higher 
energy hump features arising at about ±7.5(±1) meV. The larger gap features are slightly 
asymmetric in positions, which may be induced by the tilted background. The 
superconducting coherence peaks vanishes at about 6 K, while the high energy hump features 
are suppressed with increasing temperature and gradually vanish above 26 K. b, The STS 
spectra normalized by the one measured in the normal state (at 26 K). A dashed red color line  
highlights the superconducting coherence peaks at around 3.5 meV. c, The STS spectra 
normalized by the one measured in the normal state (at 8 K).

Supplementary Information 
 
I. 
The Laue x-ray diffraction pattern 
The structure and quality of the crystals were checked with the Laue x-ray diffraction. 
The experimental result is presented in Fig.S1a. One can see very symmetric and bright spots, 
indicating a good crystallinity. In Fig.S1b we show the model fitting results using the PSL 
Viewer software. The pink, blue and yellow lines represent [01m], [11m] and [21m] directions 
respectively. The horizontal and vertical directions of the pattern correspond to a-axis or 
b-axis. 
  
 
 
Figure S1 | Laue diffraction pattern and analysis. (a) The Laue x-ray diffraction pattern of 
the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal with dimensions of about 1000×700×15 µm3. The inject 
direction of X-ray was perpendicular to the ab plane of the sample. (b) The fitting result of 
Laue x-ray diffraction pattern using PSL Viewer software.  
 
II. Composition analysis using the EDS technology 
Three single crystals were randomly selected from single crystals grown with the 
nominal compositions of NdO0.6F0.4BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, respectively. Each sample was 
measured on three different positions (a, b, c) by EDS. The obtained actual compositions were 
normalized to Nd = 1. The last column is the averaged value of three positions for the same 
sample. The accurate content of O (y) couldn’t be acquired by EDS, partially because of the 
contamination of oxygen in the air. Clearly there are some Bi and S vacancies in our single 
crystals. Interestingly the obtained concentration of fluorine is quite close to the nominal one.
