We have investigated Se substitution effect to superconductivity 
of an optimally-doped BiS2-based superconductor Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2. 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex samples with x = 0˗1 were synthesized. With 
increasing x, in-plane chemical pressure is enhanced. For x ≥ 0.6, 
superconducting transitions with a large shielding volume fraction 
are observed in magnetic susceptibility measurements, and the 
highest Tc is 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From low-temperature electrical 
resistivity measurements, a zero-resistivity state is observed for all 
the samples, and the highest Tc is observed for x = 0.8. With 
increasing Se concentration, characteristics of electrical resistivity 
changes from semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the 
emergence of bulk superconductivity is linked with the enhanced 
metallicity. 
A

phase 
diagram 
of 
the 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor is established. Temperature 
dependences of electrical resistivity show an anomalous two-step 
transition under high magnetic fields. Hence, the resistivity data are 
analyzed with assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
BiS2-based superconductors have been drawing much attention as a new layered 
superconductor family [1-3]. The crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of 
electrically conducting BiS2 layers and insulating (blocking) layers, which resembles those of 
the Cu-based and the FeAs-based high transition temperature (high Tc) superconductors [4,5]. 
Without carrier doping, BiS2-based compounds are a semiconductor with a band gap [1,6,7]. 
However, BiS2-based compounds become metal (sometimes bad-metal) by introduction of 
electron carriers in the BiS2 layers, and superconductivity is observed in electron-doped 
compounds. The scenario that superconductivity is induced in a band insulator by carrier 


2 
 
doping seems conventional. However, the emergence of superconductivity in BiS2-based 
compounds is related with not only carrier doping but also crystal structure optimization. The 
best example is LaO1-xFxBiS2. Although superconducting transitions are observed in 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 when electron carriers were doped by substitution of F for O, bulk 
superconductivity never appears while filamentary superconductivity with a small shielding 
volume fraction is observed. In addition, Tc in the filamentary superconducting phase is less 
than 3 K for optimally doped x = 0.5 [2]. The absence of bulk superconductivity can be 
explained with the long in-plane Bi-S distance in LaO1-xFxBiS2, which interferes the 
enhancement of orbital overlaps of in-plane Bi and S. This scenario can be linked to 
semiconducting-like behavior in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity in 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 with enough carrier doping. Therefore, to induce bulk superconductivity in 
LaO1-xFxBiS2, the enhancement of orbital overlaps are required [8]; hereafter, we focus on 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.5) to emphasize the importance of crystal structure to the emergence of 
bulk superconductivity.  
There are two kinds of way to achieve the enhancement of orbital overlaps and bulk 
superconductivity. One of the strategies is high pressure effect [9]. Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is 
largely enhanced from ~3 K to ~10 K under external high pressure above 1 GPa [9-12]. The 
large increase of Tc under high pressure in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 accompanies with a structural 
transition from tetragonal (P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P21/m) [10]. In a monoclinic phase, a 
shorter Bi-S bond is showing up, with which the enhancement of orbital overlaps between Bi 
and S can be expected. In addition, structural distortion can be introduced by synthesizing 
samples under high pressure, as well as the external pressure effect, in BiS2-based compounds 
[2,13-17]. The high-pressure synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples contain local in-plane 
distortion [18] and show a high Tc, which is close to Tc observed in high-pressure experiment. 
Namely, both application of external pressure and high-pressure synthesis can induce 
superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
The other strategy to induce bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is chemical pressure 
effect. For example, isovalent substitution of La3+ by smaller Pr3+, Nd3+, or Sm3+ induces bulk 
superconductivity, and Tc reaches above 5 K in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 or Nd1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[19-22]. The rare earth (RE) substitution does not affect the structural symmetry (within X-ray 
diffraction) but compresses BiS planes. Compressing Bi-S distance enhances Bi-S orbital 
overlaps and then achieves bulk superconductivity. Similar chemical pressure effect can be 
produced in Se-substituted system, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23]. Although Bi-Ch (Ch: chalcogen) 


3 
 
plane expands by substitution of in-plane S2- by larger Se2- [24], the packing density of Bi-Ch 
plane is enhanced due to the unchanged LaO blocking layer structure [8]. As a result, orbital 
overlaps of in-plane Bi and Ch is enhanced by Se substitution, and bulk superconductivity is 
induced by chemical pressure effect in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
On the basis of these experimental facts, we recently proposed the importance of in-plane 
chemical pressure to the emergence of superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 [8]. Both 
chemical pressure effects, such as RE-substitution and Ch-substitution effects in 
REO0.5F0.5BiCh2, can be regarded as the same effect from the viewpoint of the tuning of 
orbital overlaps of Bi and Ch. In addition, this scenario could be extensible to the pressure 
effect. Therefore, it is important to obtain further evidences on this scenario, and hence, 
investigation of in-plane chemical pressure effect to superconductivity (particularly 
Se-substitution effect) in new system, which is different from REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 but has a 
similar situation (similar lattice structure and physical properties) with LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. A good 
candidate is RE-substituted EuFBiS2, Eu0.5RE0.5FBiS2 [25,26]. The substitution of Eu2+ by 
RE3+ introduces 0.5 electrons per Bi, which is the same amount as LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lattice 
constant of Eu0.5RE0.5FBiS2 is a ~ 4.07 Å, which is closed to that of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. In 
addition, Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2 shows filamentary superconductivity with an onset Tc (Tc
onset) of 
~2.3 K, and Tc increases up to 10 K under high pressure [26]. Considering these quite similar 
situations in between Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we expected the emergence of bulk 
superconductivity in Se-substituted Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Here, we report the emergence of 
superconductivity by Se substitution in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, which provides new evidence 
that in-plane chemical pressure effect can induce bulk superconductivity in BiCh2-based 
compounds. 
 
2. Experimental details 
Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 were 
prepared by a solid state reaction method. Powders of EuS (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), BiF3 
(99.9%), and LaF3 (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%) and Se (99.999%) were 
mixed, pelletized, and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The heating temperature was 
optimized for each composition: the samples were heated for 20 h at 780ºC for x = 0 and 0.2, 
at 700ºC for x = 0.4 and 0.6, and at 650ºC for x = 0.8 and 1. The obtained sample was ground, 
mixed, pelletized, and heated with the same heating condition. 
The obtained samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a 


4 
 
CuKa radiation by the -2 method. The XRD patterns were analyzed using the Rietveld 
method [27]. Temperature (T) dependence of electrical resistivity () under magnetic fields 
was measured using a four-terminal method with Physical Property Measurement System 
(PPMS, Quantum Design) down to T = 0.5 K. Temperature dependence of magnetic 
susceptibility () was measured using a superconducting quantum interference devise 
(SQUID) magnetometer with Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS-3) by the 
SQUID-VSM mode. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1(a) shows the XRD patterns for x = 0˗1.The XRD patterns were analyzed by a 
two-phase analysis for x = 0˗0.6 and three-phase analysis for x = 0.8 and 1. The fitting results 
are shown in Figs. S1-S6 (Supplementary Materials [28]). Obtained structural parameters and 
refined populations of the impurity phases are listed in Tables S1 and S2 (Supplementary 
Materials [28]). The major phase is characterized as the EuFBiS2-type tetragonal phase with 
space group of P4/nmm [29]. For x = 0˗0.6, small amount of BiF3 impurity (less than 5%) was 
detected. For x = 0.8 and 1, Bi2Se3 impurity (~12%) was detected. Figures 1(b) and 1(c) show 
the x dependence of lattice constant (a and c). The lattice constant of a monotonically 
increases with increasing x, which can be understandable with the difference of ionic radius of 
Se2- (198 pm, assuming a coordination number of 6) and S2- (184 pm). In contrast, the lattice 
constant of c does not show an apparent expansion with increasing x. These evolutions of the 
lattice constants by Se substitution are similar to those observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23]. 
The anisotropic expansion along the a-axis in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex is resulting from the 
selective substitution of the in-plane S1 site by Se [24]. In this study, we tried to refine the Se 
occupancy for the Ch1 and Ch2 sites, but Se occupancy at Ch2 was refined as almost zero or 
a small negative value for x = 0˗0.6. Hence, we fixed Se occupancy at Ch1 as nominal x = 
0˗0.6. For x = 0.8 and 1, small amount of Se was refined at Ch2 site. These results suggest the 
doped Se selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Although further analysis with 
synchrotron XRD or single crystal XRD is needed to precisely determine the Se occupancy, 
the tendency that doped Se occupies the in-plane Ch1 site is the same as LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
As demonstrated in Ref. 8, in-plane chemical pressure (CP), which is calculated as CP = 
(RBi + RCh) / (Bi-Ch bond distance), where RBi and RCh are ionic radii of Bi and Ch, can be a 
good scale to qualitatively compare the magnitude of in-plane CP and physical properties in 
BiCh2 compounds [8]. We used RBi estimated from average Bi-S bond distances of 


5 
 
LaO0.54F0.46BiS2, as demonstrated in Ref. 8 [30]. Figure 2 shows the x dependences of 
in-plane CP for Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. We estimated Bi-Ch bond 
distance using the structural parameters obtained from Rietveld refinement. It is clear that the 
evolution of in-plane CP in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is almost the same as that in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. Therefore, we can expect the emergence of bulk superconductivity in 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, as well as in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
Figure 3 shows the T dependences of  for x = 0˗1, which were measured after zero-field 
cooling (ZFC). Although clear superconducting signals are not observed for x = 0 and 0.2, 
diamagnetic signals corresponding to the emergence of superconductivity are observed for x = 
0.4 ˗1. The shielding volume fraction increases with increasing x, and  exceeds -1/4 for x 
= 0.6, 0.8, and 1. Indeed, Se substitution can induce bulk superconductivity in 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex at x ≥ 0.6. Tc increases with increasing x and achieves Tc = 3.7 K for x = 
0.8, and Tc of x = 1 is slightly lower than Tc of x = 0.8. In addition, we measured -T up to 
300K to investigate the normal state magnetism. There is no magnetic transition except for the 
superconducting transition, as shown in Fig. S7 (Supplementary Materials [28]), which shows 
T dependence of  for x = 0.4 at T < 300 K. 
Figure 4(a) shows the T dependences of  for x = 0˗1. For x = 0 and 0.2,  largely increases 
with decreasing T, which is semiconducting-like behavior and implying bad electron hopping 
in conduction layers. With increasing x,  is strongly suppressed, and metallic-like 
conductivity is induced for x = 0.8 and 1, as displayed in Fig. S9(a) (Supplementary Materials 
[28]). The enhanced metallicity in Se-doped compounds is consistent with the enhanced 
in-plane CP (Fig. 2), which is quite similar to the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23]. 
On superconductivity characteristics, Tc shows nonlinear evolution at a low-x regime. The 
inset figure of Fig. 4(a) shows -T curves for x = 0˗0.4 at low temperatures. For x = 0, Tc
onset 
is 2.2 K, and zero resistivity is observed below Tc
zero = 1.2 K. Except for x = 0.2 (discussed 
later), Tc increases with increasing x in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. The superconducting transitions 
for x = 0.6, 0.8, and 1 are enlarged in Fig. 4(b). The highest Tc is observed in x = 0.8. Tc
zero is 
3.8 K, which is almost the same as Tc estimated from -T for x = 0.8. Interestingly,  for those 
superconducting samples begins to decrease at a temperature well above Tc
zero: Tc
onset is 
estimated to be 6.2 K for x = 0.8 (Fig. S9(b) (Supplementary Materials [28])). Typically, high 
Tc
onset well above Tc
zero (bulk Tc) has been observed in several BiS2-based superconductors. 
For example, NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystals show a Tc
onset of ~20 K and a bulk Tc of 4˗5 K 


6 
 
[31]. Therefore, the drop of  at 6.2 K in x = 0.8 can be regarded as a local onset of 
superconductivity. 
Then, we consider the suppression of superconductivity by 20%-Se substitution (in x = 0.2). 
Although -T of x = 0.2 exhibits Tc
onset = 2.7 K,  does not drop to zero and shows a second 
superconducting transition with Tc
onset = 1.3 K and Tc
zero = 0.5 K in x = 0.2. The two-step 
transition should be caused by the existence of minor regions having a higher Tc of 2.7 K, and 
Tc of the major phase should be lower than that of x = 0, because of Tc
zero = 0.5 K. The 
decrease of bulk Tc by 20%-Se substitution is also seen in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23]. The 
suppression of Tc may be explained by a local distortion scenario. We assume that 
superconductivity observed in x = 0 is not bulk in nature and emerging due to local distortion 
(or disorder). In other words, the tetragonal Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2 (x = 0) should not be a bulk 
superconductor due to low in-plane CP. In general, the crystal structure of BiCh2-based 
superconductors is flexible in between tetragonal (P4/nmm) and monoclinic (P21/m) [32], and 
the in-plane structure contains large disorder [18,33-35]. In fact, LaOBiS2-based and 
EuFBiS2-based superconductors show a large increase of Tc under high pressure, which 
accompanies a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic [9-12,36-37]. Assuming the 
presence of local distortion, which induces filamentary superconductivity in x = 0, we 
consider that the superconductivity with Tc
zero = 0.5 is induced in the tetragonal phase of x = 
0.2 when the local in-plane distortion (or disorder) is suppressed by the enhancement of 
in-plane CP, as observed in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 [35]. 
From the -Tand the -T measurements, a superconductivity phase diagram is established 
(Fig. 5). For x = 0 and 0.2, a semiconducting-like behavior is observed in -T, and bulk 
superconductivity is not observed. For x = 0.4, the semiconducting-like behavior in -T is 
suppressed, and superconducting transition is clearly observed in both -T and -T. With 
increasing x, metallic conductivity is induced, and bulk superconductivity is induced; the 
highest Tc is Tc
zero = 3.8 K for x = 0.8. Similarly to LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, both metallic 
conductivity and bulk superconductivity are induced by Se substitution in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex 
as well. We, thus, propose that the in-plane CP is one of the most important parameters for the 
emergence of metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity in BiCh2-based 
superconductors. 
We discuss the electrical transport properties of x = 0.6 and 0.8 under high magnetic fields. 
The x = 0.6 sample shows bulk superconductivity and is qualified as almost single-phase in 
XRD, so that we can reliably obtain intrinsic superconducting properties from the transport 


7 
 
properties under magnetic fields. The x = 0.8 sample contains 13% impurity phases, but the Tc 
is the highest among the series. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show -T under magnetic fields up to 
0H = 5 T for x = 0.6 and 0.8, respectively. Tc
zero is suppressed with increasing H. The Tc
onset, 
for example, Tc
onset = 6.2 K for x = 0.8, is also suppressed with increasing H. Noticeably, at 
high H, other kink appears below Tc
onset, as if there are two kinds of Tc
onset. Similar behavior is 
sometimes observed in BiCh2-based superconductors [2,26,31,38,39]. Namely, there are, at 
least, two components related to the emergence of superconductivity in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex; 
one component is relatively strong against the high magnetic field and the other is largely 
suppressed by the high magnetic field. In a previous study on upper critical field (Hc2) of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, -T under high magnetic fields was analyzed from temperature dependences 
of the T derivative of , d/dT [38]. With the Hc2 analysis based on T-derivative of  or , 
anisotropy of Hc2 has been estimated using a polycrystalline sample of several 
superconductors [38,40]. 
T dependences of d/dT of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex show two kinds of inflection points, as 
shown in Fig. 6(a) and Fig. S10 (Supplementary Materials [28]). Here, we define two kinds of 
Tc
onset as Tc
1 and Tc
2; the estimation of Tc
1 and Tc
2 is described in Fig. S10. Tc
1 and Tc
2 
estimated from d/dT correspond to the higher Tc
onset and the lower Tc
onset in -T, respectively. 
For x = 0.6 and 0.8, all Tc
1 and Tc
2 are estimated in the same manner and plotted in Figs. 6(c) 
and 6(d); the data points are represented as upper critical fields, Hc2
1 and Hc2
2, in Figs. 6(c) 
and 6(d), respectively. In addition, irreversible field, Hirr, is estimated from Tc
zero and plotted 
in Figs. 6(c) and (d). With decreasing T, Hc2
1 and Hc2
2 increase, but the robustness of 
superconductivity against H is clearly different in between Hc2
1 and Hc2
2 for both x. The 
anomalous anisotropy of Hc2 cannot be explained by the anisotropy of Hc2 in between H//a 
and H//c because BiCh2-based superconductors exhibit extremely high anisotropy of 
superconductivity with an anisotropy parameter () of 30-40 [41]. Therefore, the presence of 
two kinds of Hc2, anisotropy of Hc2, should be regarded as in-plane anisotropy, as proposed 
for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [38]. Although such in-plane anisotropy of superconductivity should not 
appear in a perfect tetragonal superconductor, in-plane local distortions can lift degeneracy of 
the Bi-6px and Bi-6py orbitals, which locally induces anisotropy of superconducting states in 
the BiCh plane. We mentioned possible suppression of in-plane distortion by Se substitution 
in above discussion of the x dependence of Tc
zero, but it should be possible that the in-plane 
local distortion still exists and causes a local high-Tc phase (Tc
1 and Hc2
1). We notice that the 
data points of Hirr and Hc2
2 of x = 0.8 almost correspond to those of x = 0.6. This suggests that 


8 
 
bulk superconductivity is almost induced at x = 0.6. Further Se substitutions, x > 0.6, do not 
largely affect the bulk properties of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex but enhance Tc
onset (Tc
1) and 
metallicity. To understand the origin of the higher Tc
onset (Tc
1), further investigations are 
needed. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system, Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, with the 
expecting of the emergence of bulk superconductivity by in-plane chemical pressure effect. 
Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex with x = 0˗1 were synthesized by solid state 
reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that Se selectively occupied at the 
in-plane Ch1 site, and hence, in-plane chemical pressure was enhanced. For x ≥ 0.6, 
superconducting transitions with a large shielding volume fraction were observed in -T 
measurements, and the highest Tc was 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From -T measurements, a 
zero-resistivity state was observed for all the samples, and the highest Tc was observed for x = 
0.8. 
With 
increasing 
Se 
concentration, 
characteristics 
of 
-T 
changed 
from 
semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk superconductivity is 
linked with the enhanced metallicity via in-plane chemical pressure. A superconductivity 
phase diagram of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor was established. The -T data under 
high magnetic fields were analyzed with assuming in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field, 
which indicated local in-plane distortion may result in the high-Tc
onset, obviously higher than 
the bulk Tc.

Table S1. Refined structural parameters for Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Ch1 and Ch2 sites are the in-plane 
and out-of-plane chalcogen sites. The atomic coordinates of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex in the tetragonal 
P4/nmm space group can be described as (0, 0.5, z) for Eu/La, Bi, Ch1, and Ch2, and (0, 0, 0) for F. 
Thermal factor (B) for Eu/La, F, Bi, Ch1, Ch2 were fixed as 0.5, 1, 1.5, 1.5, and 1, which were typical 
values determined from synchrotron XRD in 1112-type compounds. In this study, we tried to refine 
the Se occupancy for the Ch1 and Ch2 sites, but Se occupancy at Ch2 was refined as almost 
zero or a small negative value for x = 0˗0.6. Hence, we fixed Se occupancy at Ch1 as nominal 
x = 0˗0.6. For x = 0.8 and 1, small amount of Se was refined at Ch2 site: 1%-Se (for x = 0.8) 
and 7%-Se (for x = 1) were refined for Ch2 site.
