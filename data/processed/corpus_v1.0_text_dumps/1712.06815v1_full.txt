Abstract 
In order to understand the mechanisms behind the emergence of superconductivity by the 
chemical pressure effect in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd), where bulk superconductivity 
is induced by the substitutions with a smaller-radius RE, we performed synchrotron powder X-ray 
diffraction, and analyzed the crystal structure and anisotropic displacement parameters. With the 
decrease of the RE3+ ionic radius, the in-plane disorder of the S1 sites significantly decreased, very 
similar to the trend observed in the Se-substituted systems: LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-
xSex. Therefore, the emergence of bulk superconductivity upon the suppression of the in-plane disorder 
at the chalcogen sites is a universal scenario for the BiCh2-based superconductors. In addition, we 
indicated that the amplitude of vibration along the c-axis of the in-plane chalcogen sites may be related 
to the Tc in the BiCh2-based superconductors.

BiS2-based layered compounds have been extensively studied owing to the discovery of 
superconductivity in electron-doped phases and their relatively high transition temperatures (Tc), as 
high as 11 K [1–3]. A typical parent phase of the BiS2-based superconductor is REOBiS2 (RE: rare 
earth element), which has a layered structure composed of alternate stacks of REO insulating 
(blocking) layers and BiS2 electrically conducting layers; it has a band gap of ~1 eV [2–5]. Electron 
carriers can be introduced in the BiS2 layers by partial substitutions of the elements of the blocking 
REO layers [6–11]. For example, in LaO1-xFxBiS2, the partial substitutions of O2- sites with F- generate 
electron carriers; the carrier concentration can be manipulated by varying the amount of substituted F 
[2]. Bulk superconductivity with a large shielding fraction in the magnetization measurements was not 
observed in electron-doped LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples prepared using the solid-state reaction method at 
ambient pressure; however, filamentary superconducting states with a small shielding volume fraction 
were observed at Tc ~2.5 K [2]. In addition, the observed temperature dependence of the electrical 
resistivity was not metallic-like; it showed a weakly localized behavior in LaO1-xFxBiS2, although band 
calculations suggested that the electron-doped LaO1-xFxBiS2 should be metal [4, 5, 12]. These results 
suggested that the doped electrons were localized by the effect of structural disorder. 
In order to induce bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2, high pressure effects can be employed. 
The application of an external pressure induces bulk superconductivity with a Tc of ~10 K [13–15]. In 
addition, samples annealed under a high pressure (~2 GPa) also exhibit bulk superconductivity with a 
Tc of ~10 K [2, 16–18]. The emergence of bulk superconductivity and increase of Tc in the high-
pressure phase can be attributed to the structural phase transition from the tetragonal low-Tc phase to 
the monoclinic high-Tc phase [13]. 
Another approach to induce bulk superconductivity in the LaO1-xFxBiS2 system is to introduce a 
chemical pressure by an isovalent substitution, such as Ch (Ch: S, Se) and/or RE site substitutions. In 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, the substitutions of Se for the S sites induces bulk superconductivity with a Tc of 
~3.8 K [19, 20]. Another isovalent substitution is the RE site substitution. With the decrease of the 
RE3+ (mean) ionic radius in REO0.5F0.5BiS2, the BiS2 layer becomes compressed, in particular along 
the ab-plane direction, and bulk superconductivity is induced [21]. As the isovalent substitution does 
not significantly affect the carrier concentration, the structural optimization induces superconductivity 
in the Ch- and RE-substituted systems. In order to analyze the essential factor for the emergence of 
the superconductivity, we considered the commonality of the chemical pressure effects between the 
Ch- and RE substitutions, by introducing the concept of an in-plane chemical pressure [22]. 
The emergence of the bulk superconductivity in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex system was explained by 
the decrease in the in-plane disorder of the chalcogen sites with the increase of the Se content, which 
was detected through a crystal structure analysis of the synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) pattern 
[23] and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) [24]. A similar relationship between the 
in-plane disorder and emergence of superconductivity was observed in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex [25–27].

For both systems, the Se substitutions induced a metallic electrical conductivity. Therefore, the in-
plane disorder of the in-plane chalcogen sites is the factor that prevented the emergence of 
superconductivity and metallic conductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Therefore, we expect that a similar 
suppression of the in-plane disorder at the in-plane S sites (S1 site in Fig. 1(b)) can be attributed with 
the emergence of superconductivity in the RE-substituted systems. Neutron diffraction and pair 
distribution function analysis revealed the presence of the in-plane disorder and its relationship with 
the superconductivity, where RE is La or Nd [28, 29]. In addition, EXAFS measurements reveled a 
suppression of the Bi-S1-bond-disorder with the decrease of the RE3+ radius [30]. Therefore, in this 
study, we investigated the atomic displacement parameters of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, Pr, 
and Nd using SXRD and Rietveld refinement. Anisotropic analyses of the displacement parameters 
revealed that the in-plane displacement of S1 was very large for RE = La and gradually decreased with 
the decrease of the RE3+ ionic radius. This behavior is equal to that of the Se substitution. Therefore, 
the suppression of the in-plane disorder at the in-plane S1 (or Ch1) sites and emergence of 
superconductivity by the chemical pressure effects are universal for BiCh2-based superconductors. As 
unconventional superconductivity states are likely to appear in both Ch-substituted La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)2 
and RE-substituted REO0.5F0.5BiS2 systems [31–33], the universality revealed in this study could be 
employed to further understand the mechanisms of the superconductivity in the BiCh2-based 
superconductors. 
 
Polycrystalline samples of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd were prepared using the 
solid-state-reaction method [2, 6–9]. A mixture of the starting materials was pressed into a pellet and 
annealed at 700 °C for 20 h in an evacuated quartz tube. SXRD was performed at the beamline 
BL02B2, SPring-8 at a wavelength of 0.49559 Å (proposal No.: 2017B1211). The SXRD experiments 
were performed with a sample rotator system at room temperature; the diffraction data were collected 
using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector (multiple MYTHEN system [34]) 
with a step size of 2 = 0.006º. The crystal structure parameters were refined using the Rietveld method 
with the RIETAN-FP program [35]. Images with schematic models of the crystal structures were 
produced using VESTA [36]. 
 
Figure 1(a) shows the superconductivity phase diagram of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 as a function of the 
RE3+ ionic radius. The filamentary superconducting states observed for La are suppressed for Ce. A 
polycrystalline sample of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 with 50% F substitution does not show superconductivity; 
however, CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 with 70% F substitution shows bulk superconductivity upon the effect of high 
pressure [37]. As reported in Ref. 21, bulk superconductivity of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 appears at an RE3+-
radius of ~113 pm, which corresponds to RE = Pr or Ce0.5Nd0.5. Tc increases with the decrease of the 
RE3+ radius. The temperature dependences of the magnetization for the samples used in this study are 


4 
 
shown in Figure S1 of the Supplemental Material [38]. Tc values estimated from the magnetization 
measurements are represented with the larger circles in Fig. 1(a), which are in agreement with the 
results of a previous study [21]. 
Figure 2 shows the SXRD patterns and Rietveld refinement results for RE = (a) La, (b) Ce, (c) Pr, 
and (d) Nd. The Rietveld refinements were performed using a tetragonal P4/nmm model. For RE = La, 
Ce, and Pr, a small portion (smaller than 4%) of REF3 impurity phases was detected, and a two-phase 
analysis was performed. For RE = Nd, unidentified impurity peaks were observed; hence, we analyzed 
the data for RE = Nd by a single-phase analysis. For all data, excellent fitting was also obtained at 
higher angles, required for a precise refinement of the displacement parameters. 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the dependences of the lattice constants a and c as a function of the 
RE3+ ionic radius. The lattice constant a linearly decreases with the decrease of the RE3+ radius. 
However, the lattice constant c does not exhibit a clear correlation with the RE3+ radius. Figure 3(c) 
shows the dependences of the Bi-S1 and Bi-S2 bond distances as a function of the RE3+ ionic radius 
(See Fig. 1(b) for the labeling of the S sites). It can be noticed that the in-plane Bi-S1 distance decreases 
with the decrease of the RE3+ radius, owing to the linear decrease in the lattice constant a. In contrast, 
Bi-S2 and interplane Bi-S1 distances do not decrease upon the introduction of chemical pressure, 
which may be related with the nonlinear change in the lattice constant c. However, as reported in Ref. 
22, the essential factor for the emergence of superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 systems is the 
in-plane chemical pressure. In the considered REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system, the amplitude of the in-plane 
chemical pressure is directly determined by the in-plane Bi-S1 distance. Therefore, we can analyze 
the relationship between the chemical pressure, superconductivity, and in-plane disorder using the 
considered samples. 
We performed Rietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters U11 and U33 for the 
in-plane Bi and S1 sites. Figure 4(c) illustrates U11 and U33 using a schematic model with RE = Pr. For 
the other sites, isotropic displacement parameters were assumed for the refinements. The obtained U11 
and U33 for the Bi and S1 sites are plotted in Figs. 4(a) and 4(b), respectively. As expected, U11 for the 
S1 sites is very large for RE = La, and decreases with the decrease of the RE3+ radius, a very similar 
trend with that observed for U11 for the in-plane chalcogen sites in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23]. Therefore, 
the large suppression of the in-plane disorder at the in-plane chalcogen sites can be universally 
attributed with the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 systems. It is worth 
noting that U11 for the Bi sites slightly increases with the decrease of the RE3+ radius. Recently, 
Athauda et al. proposed that the increase in the in-plane displacement of Bi may be attributed with the 
superconductivity in NdO1-xFxBiS2, while the in-plane displacement of S1 would induce carrier 
localization [29]. Our analysis also suggests that the increase of the in-plane displacement of the Bi 
sites may be related with the enhanced Tc for RE = Pr and Nd. Similar trend is observed for U33 in Fig. 
4(b). Although U33 for the Bi sites does not considerably change with the decrease of the RE3+ radius, 


5 
 
U33 for the S1 sites dramatically changes with the replacement of the RE. It is worth noting that the 
evolution of U33 for the S1 sites seems to be linked with the enhancement of Tc. A similar evolution of 
the displacement ellipsoids is observed in Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, as shown in Fig. 5. Both 
RE and Ch substitutions suppress U11 for the Ch1 sites; however, they enhance U33 for the Ch1 sites. 
This trend may suggest that the amplitude of the one-dimensional large vibration of S1 is correlated 
with the Tc in this system. If this is valid, then the Tc increases when the phonon frequency decreases 
with the increase of the amplitude of the S1 vibration along the c-axis. This scenario is not consistent 
with the conventional phonon-mediated mechanisms. It is consistent with the isotope effect; no isotope 
effect was observed for the LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 samples with 76Se and 80Se isotopes [31]. If such large 
vibrations of Ch1 are related with the enhancement of Tc, charge fluctuation should occur in the 
superconducting Bi-Ch1 plane. Then, the pairing phenomena mediated by charge fluctuations, 
proposed by theoretical and experimental studies [28, 29, 32, 39], may occur in the BiCh2-based 
system. 
 
In conclusion, we investigated the crystal structure and anisotropic displacement parameters of 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd, where bulk superconductivity is induced by substitutions 
with a smaller-radius RE, such as Pr or Nd. With the decrease of the RE3+ ionic radius, the lattice 
constant a and in-plane Bi-S1 distance monotonically decreased, which generated the in-plane 
chemical pressure effect. With the decrease of the RE3+ radius, the in-plane disorder of the S1 sites 
significantly decreased. This trend is very similar to those observed for Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-
xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Therefore, the emergence of bulk superconductivity upon the 
suppression of the in-plane disorder at the Ch1 sites seems to be a universal scenario for the BiCh2-
based superconductors. The analyses of the displacement parameters along the c-axis indicated that 
the amplitude of the one-dimensional vibration of S1 (or Ch1) along the c-axis was correlated with Tc 
in the BiCh2-based superconductors.
