Abstract 
 Crystal structure and physical properties of the novel BiS2-based layered superconductors are briefly reviewed. 
Superconductivity in the BiS2-based layered compounds is induced by electron doping into the BiS2 conduction 
layers. The superconducting properties seem to correlate with the crystal structure. Possible strategies for increasing 
transition temperature in this family are discussed. 
 
Introduction 
Since the discovery of the cuprate layered superconductors, materials possessing a layered crystal 
structure have been one of the mostly-studied systems on exploration of new superconductors [1]. The 
discovery of the Fe-based superconductors in 2008 has also accelerated studies on new layered materials 
[2]. One of the reasons for the tremendous amount of attentions in the layered superconductors is the 
observation of unconventional paring mechanisms due to low-dimensional characteristics of conductive 
electrons. Another merit of layered materials in exploring for new superconductors is the variation of 
crystal structure. In general, the layered superconductors possess a crystal structure composed of an 
alternate stacking of a common superconducting layer and a blocking (spacer) layer. In the Fe-based 
family, the Fe2An2 layers (An = P, As, S, Se or Te) could act as a common superconducting layer, and a 
lot of Fe-based superconductors have been discovered by changing the blocking layer structure [2-4]. 
Namely, if we discover a new type of superconducting layers, we can design a lot of layered 
superconductors. In 2012, the novel layered superconductors with a BiS2-based superconducting layer 
have been discovered [5,6]. So far, 11 superconductors have been discovered, and some notable 
characteristics have been observed in this family [7-11]. Here, the crystal structure and physical properties 
of the BiS2-based superconductors are briefly reviewed. 
 
 
Crystal structure and superconducting properties 
Figure 1(a) and (b) show the schematic images of the crystal structure of typical BiS2-based 
superconductor LaOBiS2 and Bi4O4S3, respectively. Both materials are composed of an alternate stacking 
of the BiS2 double layers and the blocking layer. Electron carriers, which are essential for the appearance 
of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family, can be generated (controlled) by modifying the structure 
and the composition at the blocking layers. In the REOBiS2 system (RE = Rare earth), electron carriers 
can be generated upon a partial substitution of O2- by F- [6], which is an electron-doping strategy used in 
the FeAs-based superconductors. In the Bi4O4S3 superconductor, partial defects at the (SO4)2- site can 
provide electron carriers into the BiS2 layers [5].

Fig. 1. (a) Crystal structure of LaOBiS2. (b) Crystal structure of Bi4O4S3. In this figure, the structure is 
depicted with full site occupancy: Namely, the elemental composition of the shown structure is Bi6O8S5. 
In real, there would be ~50 % defects at the (SO4)2- site, which corresponds to the composition of 
Bi4O4S3. 
 
The physical properties of BiS2-based compounds are introduced with the data of the LaO1-xFxBiS2 
system. Figure 2(a) displays the temperature dependence of resistivity for LaOBiS2 (parent phase) and 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The parent phase exhibits semiconducting transport behavior. With the partial substitution 
of O by F, the resistivity decreases and superconducting transition is observed at ~3 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
The superconducting properties can be enhanced by annealing the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconducting sample 
under high pressure (HP). Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for as-grown and 
HP-annealed LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The onset of the transition temperature (Tc) is clearly enhanced from 3 to 
10.6 K by the HP annealing [6,10]. It was found that the uniaxial strain (contraction) along the c axis is 
generated by the HP annealing [11]. These facts indicate that the optimization local structure is essential 
for the appearance of bulk superconductivity at a higher temperature in the BiS2-based superconductors. It 
was also reported that the application of external pressure could enhance the Tc of as-grown 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Furthermore, the crystal structure analysis under HP showed that the structural transition 
from tetragonal to monoclinic was positively linked with the enhancement of Tc under high pressure [12]. 
Theoretical investigations suggested that the slight changes in the local crystal structure such as the z 
coordinate of S at the BiS2 layer could largely affect the band structure [13,14]. In these regards, the 
correlation between superconductivity and local crystal structure should be important to understand the 
mechanisms and to enhance the Tc in the BiS2-based superconductors. 
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of normalized resistivity around superconducting 
transition for the typical BiS2-based superconductors, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (HP-annealed), CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 
(HP-annealed), NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (as-grown) andBi4O4S3 (as-grown). Here the transport data for the samples 
with the highest Tc in the respective systems are summarized. The midpoints of Tc are summarized in Fig. 
3(b). To discuss the tendency of the Tc, the area where the superconducting properties (Tc) are optimized 
is highlighted with a green square. The optimized Tc in the LaOBiS2 system is the highest. Then, the 
optimized Tc tends to decrease by changing the blocking layer structure in an order of La2O2, Ce2O2, 
Nd2O2 and Bi4O4(SO4). The tendency can be understand with the change in the ionic radius of the anion 
(La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+ and Bi3+) in the blocking layer. The ionic radius of the anion directly tune the a axis 
length in this family. In fact, the optimized Tc in the BiS2-based superconductors well correlates with the 
length of the a axis.

Strategies to enhance superconducting properties 
In the above, possible two structural parameters are suggested to be essential for superconductivity in 
the BiS2 family. The first one is the local structure correlated with the uniaxial compression along the a 
axis, which can be optimized by applying high pressure. This should be essential for the appearance of 
bulk superconductivity in the respective systems. The other parameter is the length of the a axis, which 
can be tuned by changing the blocking layer. Unfortunately, the largest rare earth is La; hence, we cannot 
synthesize new REOBiS2 materials with larger a axis. Therefore, we should discover new blocking layers. 
For example, the structure similar to Bi6O8S5, Fig. 1(b), is a candidate. If the Bi could be substituted with 
rare earth, larger a axis could be obtained. Another strategy is to use a perovskite-oxide blocking layer, 
which is formed in the Fe-based superconductor Sr4Sc2O6Fe2P2 [17]. 
Recently, superconductors with Bi-Se and Bi-Te conduction layers were discovered. Maziopa et al. 
reported that LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 with a structure similar to LaOBiS2 showed superconductivity below 2.6 K 
[18,19]. Malliakas et al. reported that CsBi4Te6 exhibited superconductivity below 4.4 K by electron

carrier doping. The Bi-Te blocks of CsBi4Te6 are similar to the NaCl structure as well as the BiS2 layers. 
Therefore, superconductivity observed in doped CsBi4Te6 could be driven with the mechanisms same as 
the BiS2-based superconductors. Hence, replacement of BiS2 layers by Bi-Se or Bi-Te layers could be a 
promising strategy for enhancing Tc of Bi-based superconductors.
