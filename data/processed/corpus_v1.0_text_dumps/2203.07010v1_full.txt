Abstract 
We report the upper critical field (Bc2) in the BiCh2-based superconductors CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3). Single crystals of CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3) 
were grown using the flux method. Single-crystal structural analysis revealed that the crystal structure 
at room temperature is tetragonal (P4/nmm). Through electrical resistivity and magnetization 
measurements, bulk superconductivity was observed in all samples. For CeOBiS1.7Se0.3, the in-plane 
Bc2 is smaller than the conventional orbital limit and Pauli limit, suggesting that ferromagnetic ordering, 
which has been observed in a related Ce-containing BiCh2-based compound, affects Bc2 and 
superconductivity. In contrast, high in-plane Bc2 was observed for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3). We 
propose that the in-plane Bc2 is enhanced by antisymmetric spin–orbit coupling, which arises from the 
lack of local inversion symmetry.

Ⅰ. Introduction 
 
Since the discovery of BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductors in 2012 [1-3], the BiCh2-
based compound family has attracted considerable attention owing to the similarities of their crystal 
structures with those of cuprate and FeAs-based superconductors [4-5]. A typical BiCh2-based system 
is given by REOBiCh2 (RE: rare earth), which has a layered structure composed of alternating stacks 
of electrically conductive BiCh2 layers and insulating (blocking) REO layers. In general, the parent 
phase of REOBiCh2 is a band insulator [3,6]. Hence, electron carrier doping to the conduction bands, 
which are mainly composed of Bi-6px and Bi-6py orbitals in the system, is required to induce 
superconductivity [3]. In addition, the optimization of local crystal structures is essential for the 
emergence of bulk superconductivity because the superconducting properties are strongly affected by 
the presence of in-plane local disorders (local distortion) in BiCh2-based compounds [7-9]. One of the 
typical routes to suppress local structural disorder is to increase the in-plane chemical pressure (CP) 
[3,10]. There are two ways to apply a positive in-plane CP in the REOBiCh2 system: (i) using a smaller 
RE and/or (ii) substituting Se for the S site. In particular, the flexibility of compositional manipulation 
of the REO blocking layers has made it possible to synthesize BiCh2-based superconductors with 
various compositions. Although many experimental [11] and theoretical [12] investigations have been 
performed with various compositions, superconducting gap symmetry and the pairing glue remain 
unclear. Therefore, further convincing evidence and research from a new perspective are highly 
desired. 
 
In 2004, the heavy fermion superconductor CePt3Si without global inversion symmetry was 
discovered [13], which triggered various studies on noncentrosymmetric superconductivity. In non-
centrosymmetric systems, antisymmetric spin–orbit coupling (ASOC) is induced, and many novel 
properties such as parity mixing, magnetoelectric effects [14,15], and anomalous paramagnetic pair-
breaking effects [16,17] can be expected. Recently, theoretical studies have predicted that the breaking 
of local inversion symmetry affects the physical properties, even if the global inversion symmetry is 
preserved [18]. Moreover, an anomalous upper critical field (Bc2) was observed in artificial 
superlattices composed of the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCoIn5 and normal metal YbCoIn5 
owing to the Rashba-type ASOC, wherein the local inversion symmetry is broken [19]. Although many 
systems have local inversion symmetry, spin polarization generally cancels each other. Therefore, 
there are only a limited number of materials in which the effect of local inversion asymmetry on the 
physical properties can be observed. For BiCh2-based compounds, a theoretical study predicted that 
hidden spin polarization by local Rashba-type ASOC should exist because of site inversion asymmetry 
for the Bi and S sites [20]. Indeed, spin polarization attributed to the local Rashba-type ASOC was 
observed by spin-ARPES (SARPES) for LaO0.55F0.45BiS2 [21]. Furthermore, notably, the type of rare 
earth element and Se substitution could change the amplitude of ASOC [22]. We expect that studies 
that include the effect of local inversion asymmetry will bring about new viewpoints on 


3 
 
superconducting mechanisms in BiCh2-based superconductors. 
 
Very recently, extremely high Bc2 was observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0.22, 0.69) single 
crystals [23]. In these compounds, the superconducting states were not destroyed even at a magnetic 
field strength of 55 T. This result implies that local inversion asymmetry plays a significant role in 
superconductivity, and the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect is suppressed by the Rashba-type ASOC. 
A high Bc2 value was also observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystals [24,25]. 
However, detailed measurements of Bc2 have not yet been conducted for Ce- and Pr-containing systems. 
Therefore, the investigation of Bc2 for these crystals is desired to further understand the effects of 
Rashba-type ASOC in REOBiCh2-type superconductors. 
 
The target materials of this study were CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3). 
In CeOBiS1.7Se0.3, bulk superconductivity was observed in single crystals and polycrystalline samples, 
with a Tc of ~3 K [26,27]. Notably, external elemental substitution on the REO layer is not required to 
generate electron carriers in the BiCh2 layers because the carriers are self-doped via the mixed-valence 
states of Ce [26,28]. In addition, a previous study indicated that superconductivity and ferromagnetism 
coexist in CeO1-xFxBiS2 systems [29,30]; thus, we can expect novel behaviors related to magnetic 
ordering through Bc2 measurements for the Ce system. In contrast, bulk superconductivity was 
observed in polycrystalline samples PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.3–0.9) [31]. In the PrO0.7F0.3BiS2 single 
crystal, the Tc was 3.8 K, and a high superconducting anisotropy parameter of γ = 53–58 was observed 
[32]. Because Se-substituted samples have not been reported for the Pr system, we synthesized single 
crystals of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3) and investigated the effect of Se substitution on Bc2 in this 
study. Pr ions, which have two f-electrons (S = 1, L = 5, and J = 4 for the ground state multiplet), are 
non-Kramer ions, which suggests that the crystal field can produce non-magnetic singlet states. Hence, 
the results for Bc2 may show clear differences between the Ce and Pr systems. As a result of this study, 
we show that the magnetic field-temperature phase diagrams for superconducting states in Ce-based 
and Pr-based systems exhibit clear differences. 
 
 
Ⅱ. Experimental 
 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3) single crystals were grown using a high-
temperature flux method in an evacuated quartz tube. First, polycrystalline samples with nominal 
compositions of CeOBiS1.6Se0.4 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.4) were prepared by the solid-state 
reaction method, as described in Refs. 26 and 33. The obtained polycrystalline samples (~1.0 g) were 
mixed with CsCl flux at a molar ratio of 1:20 and then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The sealed 
tube was heated at 950 °C for 15 h and slowly cooled to 650 °C at a rate of −1.0 °C/h. After the furnace 
cooled to room temperature, the quartz tube was opened under an air atmosphere, and the CsCl flux 
in the samples was dissolved in pure water.  


4 
 
 
The obtained samples were characterized by single-crystal X-ray structural analysis with 
Mo-Kα ( = 0.71075 Å) radiation on an XtaLAB (Rigaku). The structural parameters were refined 
with the tetragonal (P4/nmm) structural model using the refinement program SHELXL [34]. A crystal 
structure image was depicted using VESTA software [35]. The single crystals were analyzed using 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and their chemical compositions were investigated using 
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), with the exception of light elements. 
 
Electrical resistivity measurements were performed using a four-terminal method. The 
terminals were fabricated using Au wire and Ag paste. Resistivity measurements in magnetic fields of 
up to 9 T and 2 K were performed using a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design, 
PPMS) with a horizontal rotator. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was 
measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with an 
applied field of 10 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) on an MPMS3 (Quantum 
Design). 
 
 
Ⅲ. Results and discussion 
A. Crystal structure 
 
Figure 1 shows the crystal structure of the target system REOBiCh2. This system belongs to 
a centrosymmetric space group (P4/nmm) with a noncentrosymmetric polar site (point group C4v for 
Bi, Ch, and RE atoms) and noncentrosymmetric nonpolar sites (point group S4 for O atoms). The 
crystal structure of REOBiCh2 can be divided into three sectors: two inversion-partner BiCh2 layers 
(-sector and -sector in Fig.1) and the REO blocking layer [20]. The two adjacent BiCh2 layers were 
weakly coupled by van der Waals forces. A theoretical study suggested that the amplitude of the ASOC 
needs to be larger than the interlayer coupling to affect the physical properties of locally 
noncentrosymmetric multilayer systems [18]. In BiCh2-based compounds, the REO blocking layer 
does not affect the band structure near the Fermi surface and acts as a buffer layer. Therefore, the 
interlayer coupling is weak and the spin polarization does not cancel out between the -sector and -
sector.

We performed single-crystal X-ray structural analysis on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3) 
single crystals. Details of the analysis conditions and the refined structural parameters of 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3) are summarized in Table I. CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 were 
taken from Ref. 27. Because Se ions selectively occupy the in-plane Ch1 sites [36], the Se occupation 
ratio for the Ch2 sites was fixed at 0. In PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, the lattice parameters (a and c) increase 
with Se substitution, which can be explained by the difference in the ionic radii of Se2- and S2-. Similar 
elongations of lattice parameters by Se substitution have been observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and 
CeOBiS2-xSex [26,37]. The average ratios of the constituent elements (except for O and F) from the 
EDX analysis are shown in Table II, where the RE value was fixed at 1 for normalization. The chemical 
ratios estimated using EDX were consistent with the site occupancies obtained from the X-ray 
structural analysis.

Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of (a) the ab-plane resistivity (ρab) and (b) the 
magnetization after ZFC and FC with an applied field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis. The zero-
resistivity temperature (Tczero) and Tc estimated from magnetization measurements were ~3.3 K, which 
is almost the same as the previous result [27]. In addition, a large diamagnetic signal corresponding to 
superconductivity was observed, indicating that the observed superconducting states were bulk in 
nature.

FIG. 3. The field dependence of the ab-plane resistivity ρab at different temperatures with (a) B//ab 
and (b) B//c. The arrow indicates the direction from low to high temperatures. 
 
 
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the field dependence of ρab at different temperatures for B//ab 
and B//c, respectively. In BiCh2-based superconductors, the robustness of the superconducting state 
against the ab-plane magnetic field has been reported, and the superconducting states survive under 
ab-plane magnetic fields higher than 9 T [23-25]. In contrast, the superconducting states in 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 are suppressed under the ab-plane magnetic field below ~1.2 T (Fig.3(a)). Interestingly, 


8 
 
even though the temperature decreased from 2.5 K to 2 K, the superconducting states were destroyed 
under almost the same magnetic field. In the case of B//c, the superconducting states were immediately 
suppressed by the applied field, similar to other BiCh2-based superconductors [23-25]. The behaviors 
observed in Fig. 3(a) and 3(b) are consistent with the temperature dependence of ρab under various 
magnetic fields with B//ab and B//c (Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material [38]). 
 
Figure 4 shows Bc2 with (a) B//ab and (b) B//c as functions of the (normalized) temperature 
t = T/Tc. We defined three characteristic fields: the high-field onset of the superconducting transition 
(90% of n), mid-point field (50% of n), and zero-resistivity field (0% of n). Here, we define the 
normal state resistivity (n) as the black dashed line in Fig. 2(a). We estimated the orbital limit Bc2orb(0) 
from the initial slope of Bc2 at Tc based on the relation Bc2orb(0) = 0.69Tc(−dBc2/dT)Tc in the dirty limit 
[39] and describe the Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) curves (dashed lines in Fig. 4). In the 
case of B//ab, we found a clear difference between the observed data and WHH curves, suggesting 
that the orbital pair-breaking effect is not dominant. Furthermore, the value of Bc2//ab gradually 
approached a constant value in the low-temperature region. However, the orbital pair-breaking effect 
is dominant in the case of B//c, which is confirmed by the consistency between the WHH curves and 
the experimental data. For the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect, the Pauli limit is estimated from the 
relation BP(0) = 1.86Tc if we assume spin-singlet and weak-coupling superconductors. The Pauli limit 
is estimated to be 6.1 T ( black diamond in Fig. 4(a)), and this value is much higher than the observed 
Bc2//ab. The superconducting anisotropic parameter  was estimated to be 5.9 at 2.0 K based on the 
relation Bc2//ab/ Bc2//c. This value is much lower than those of other BiCh2-based superconductors 
[40] because of the smallness of Bc2//ab. 
 
Herein, we discuss the origin of this unexpectedly low Bc2//ab. A previous study of electrical 
resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat measurements in CeOBiS2 single crystals showed that the 
Ce 4f-electron state is well-localized split by crystalline-electric-field (CEF) effects, and the CEF 
ground state is a pure |±1/2> doublet [41]. In addition, the ab-plane was found to be a magnetic easy 
plane. In neutron scattering measurements of high-pressure-annealed CeO0.7F0.3BiS2 polycrystals with 
superconductivity, the magnetic moments were found to be ferromagnetically aligned along the c-axis 
below 7 K, and the ferromagnetic component developed in the ab-plane by applying an external 
magnetic field [30]. A similar magnetic structure was observed for CeAgSb2 [42]. Given these 
previous studies, spins possibly flop to the ab-plane by applying a magnetic field of ~ 1 T, which forms 
ferromagnetic ordering along the ab-plane in CeOBiS1.7Se0.3. Consequently, the internal magnetic field 
due to ferromagnetic ordering may break the superconductivity.

FIG. 4. The upper critical field Bc2 with (a) B//ab and (b) B//c as a function of (normalized) temperature 
t = T/Tc. The Bc2 is defined by the high-field onset of superconducting transition (90% of n), the mid-
point field (50% of n), and the zero-resistivity field (0% of n). The dashed curves show the 
Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) fits. The black diamond denotes the Pauli limit. 
 
 
 
Figure 5(a) shows a schematic of the rotation angle  for upper critical field measurements. 
The angular dependence of Bc2 at 2 K is shown in Figure 5(b). The value of Bc2() was estimated from 
the midpoint of the resistivity transition. The solid and dashed lines in Fig. 5(b) represent the 
anisotropic three-dimensional (3D) Ginzburg-Landau (GL) model and the two-dimensional (2D) 
Tinkham model, respectively. In the anisotropic-3D-GL model, the angular  dependence of Bc2 is 
expressed as the relation (Bc2() cos/Bc2//c)2 + (Bc2() sin/ Bc2//ab)2 = 1. In contrast, in the 2D-Tinkham 
model, the angular  dependence of Bc2 is expressed as |Bc2() cos/Bc2//c| + (Bc2() sin/ Bc2//ab)2 = 1. 
The experimental data were well described by the 2D-Tinkham model, suggesting that two-
dimensional nature is dominant in CeOBiS1.7Se0.3. This result supports the scenario of ferromagnetic 
ordering along the ab-plane. At 3 K, the two dimensionalities were slightly lower (Fig. S2 in the 
Supplemental Material [38]).

C. PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex 
 
Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the temperature dependences of ρab for x = 0 and 0.3, respectively. 
The Tczero in both samples was ~4.5 K, and the Tczero for x = 0 was consistent with that observed in a 
previous study [32]. In the normal state, a broad anomaly was observed at approximately 100 K for x 
= 0. Similar behaviors have been observed in PrO0.7F0.3BiS2 and NdO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals [32,43]. 
Although CDW-like instability has been pointed out for BiCh2-based compounds [44-46], the origin 
of the observed anomaly is unclear at present. Se substitution suppresses the anomalous behavior, as 
shown in Fig. 6(b). Figure 6(c) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization after ZFC and 
FC with an applied field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis. We can confirm the bulk nature of the 
superconductivity. The irreversible temperature Tcirr, which is a bifurcation point between the ZFC and 
FC curves, is 4.4 K and 4.5 K for x = 0 and 0.3, respectively. In this system, Se substitution did not 
significantly affect the Tc. The phase diagram in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex exhibits dome-shaped behavior 
upon Se substitution, while the Se substitution in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex decreases Tc [47]. Therefore, 
applying too much CP negatively affects superconductivity in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. Our results imply 
that the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex system lies in the middle region between the Ce and Nd systems.

low to high temperatures. 
 
 
Figure 7 shows the field dependence of ρab for x = 0 at different temperatures with (a) B//ab 
and (b) B//c, and for x = 0.3 at different temperatures with (c) B//ab and (d) B//c. In the case of B//ab, 


12 
 
the superconductivity was robust against the applied field in both samples. By contrast, in the case of 
B//c, the superconducting states were immediately suppressed by the field. The robustness of 
superconductivity under the fields for x = 0.3 is remarkable in the case of x = 0. The behaviors in Fig. 
7 are consistent with the temperature dependence of ρab under various magnetic fields (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplemental Material [38]). 
 
 
Figure 8 shows Bc2 as a function of (normalized) temperature t = T/Tc for x = 0 with (a) B//ab 
and (b) B//c and for x = 0.3 with (c) B//ab and (d) B//c. The definitions of the three types of upper 
critical field are the same as those in Fig. 4. We define n as the black dashed line in Fig. 6(a) and 6(b). 
In the case of B//ab, the orbital pair-breaking effect was dominant in both samples because the WHH 
curves described the experimental data well. In general, the orbital limit is enhanced when the 
coherence length along the c-axis (c) is shorter than the thickness of the REO blocking layer, and a 
Josephson vortex state is formed. In the Josephson vortex state, the orbital limit deviates from the 
WHH curve. We estimated c from the relations Bc2//c = 0/2ab2 and Bc2//ab = 0/2abc. This led to 
11 Å for x = 0 at 3.2 K, and 10 Å for x = 0.3 at 3.5 K. These values are larger than the REO blocking 
layer thickness of 2.6 Å ( 293 K). Therefore, the experimental data fitted the WHH curves. In contrast, 
the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect was suppressed in both samples. The Pauli limit is estimated to 
be 8.4 T (the black diamonds in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)) from the relation BP(0) = 1.86Tc. The experimental 
data exceeded this value at a finite temperature, and possibly exhibited a higher upper critical field at 
0 K. Some experimental results for BiCh2-based superconductors indicate a strong coupling nature 
[48-50], which leads to the enhancement of the Pauli limit. However, even if we use the reported value 
of 2kBTc = 3.4–4.5, the estimated Pauli limit is smaller than 11 T. Another possibility is that the two-
gap nature was reported in muon spin-relaxation measurements on LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [51] and scanning 
tunneling spectroscopy on NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 [52]. In the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal, the two-gap model 
explained the large upper critical field well [24]. However, the specific heat measurement of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals indicates a single-gap nature [50]. We suggested that local inversion 
asymmetry enhances the Pauli limit in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0.22, 0.69) single crystals [23]. In 
tetragonal systems with the Rashba-type ASOC, some components of magnetic susceptibility do not 
change after the superconducting transition, resulting in protection of the Cooper pairs from de-pairing 
against the applied fields [18,24,53]. To confirm the effect of Rashba-type ASOC on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-
xSex, upper critical field measurements below 3 K are required. 
 
In the case of B//c, the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect is suppressed in local inversion 
asymmetry systems with a tetragonal structure [17,18]. Thus, the orbital pair-breaking effect was 
dominant in this system. However, the experimental data derived from the WHH curves in the low-
temperature region are shown in Fig. 8(b) and 8(d). A similar behavior was observed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [23,50]. Although the origin of this behavior is currently unclear, the two-gap

model fits well with the experimental data for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [24]. The superconducting anisotropic 
parameter () was estimated to be 34.2 (x = 0) and 38.3 (x = 0.4) at 3.5 K. 
 
 
FIG. 8. The upper critical field (Bc2) as a function of (normalized) temperature t = T/Tc. The 
temperature dependence of Bc2 for x = 0 with (a) B//ab and (b) B//c, and for x = 0.3 with (c) B//ab and 
(d) B//c. Bc2 is defined by the high-field onset of superconducting transition (90% of n), the mid-point 
field (50% of n), and the zero-resistivity field (0% of n). The dashed curves show the Werthamer–
Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) fits. The black diamond denotes the Pauli limit. 
 
 
Figure 9 shows the angular dependence of Bc2 for (a) x = 0 at 3.3 K and (b) x = 0.3 at 3.7 K. 
The definitions of Bc2(), the solid line, and the dashed line are the same as those in Fig. 5. The 
experimental data are described by the anisotropic 3D-GL model for x = 0, suggesting that the 3D 


14 
 
nature is dominant. In contrast, the two dimensionalities were enhanced for x = 0.4, whereas the 
experimental data did not fit perfectly with the 2D-Tinkham model. These results indicate that the 
Abrikosov vortex states or the crossover of the conventional Abrikosov and Josephson vortex states 
was realized in this system, which is consistent with the behavior of Bc2//ab shown in Figs. 8(a) and 
8(c). The enhancement of two dimensionalities implies that the Rashba-type ASOC increases with Se 
substitution because the Rashba-type ASOC generally weakens the interlayer coupling and enhances 
the 2D nature of the superconductivity [18]. However, a theoretical study suggested that the amplitude 
of the ASOC is larger in LaOBiS2 than in LaOBiSe2 [22]. In addition, the thickness of a single crystal 
or the bulk nature of the samples may affect the behavior. Measurement of the angular dependence of 
the upper critical field using a thin film is highly desirable. The angular dependence of Bc2 at different 
temperatures is shown in Fig. S4 in the Supplemental Material [38].

Ⅳ. Conclusions 
 
We investigated Bc2 of single crystals of BiCh2-based layered superconductors 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3). In CeOBiS1.7Se0.3, we observed that Bc2//ab was 
smaller than the conventional orbital and Pauli limits. This result implies that ferromagnetic ordering 
along the ab-plane affects Bc2 and superconductivity. In contrast, a high Bc2//ab ratio was observed for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.3). The temperature dependence of Bc2//ab was well described by the WHH 
model, and at low temperatures, Bc2//ab exceeded the Pauli limit. The suppression of the paramagnetic 
pair-breaking effect is due to Rashba-type ASOC, which arises from the lack of local inversion 


15 
 
symmetry. In REOBiCh2-based compounds, local inversion asymmetry and the characteristics of the 
rare-earth element in the REO layer are essential for superconducting properties and pairing 
mechanisms.
