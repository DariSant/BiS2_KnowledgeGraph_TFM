We have demonstrated a pressure-induced phase transition from a low-Tc phase to a high-Tc phase in a 
single crystal of the superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. The high-Tc phase appears at 2.16 GPa and the 
maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is observed at 6.7 K under 2.44 GPa. Although 
the anisotropy (γ) for the low-Tc phase is estimated to be 20, it is reduced by around half (9.3) in the 
high-Tc phase. This tendency is the same for the BiS2 system. The Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 has continued to 
increase up to the maximum pressure of this study (2.44 GPa). Therefore applied further pressure has the 
potential to induce a much higher Tc in this system.

Recently, a series of BiS2-based superconductor such as Bi4O4S3
1, LnO1-xFxBiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, 
Yb) 2-8 and Sr1-xFxBiS2
 9,10 were discovered. These compounds have a layered structure composed of 
superconducting BiS2 layer and charge reservoir blocking layers. This structure is in common with the 
cuprate superconductors 11 and Fe-based superconductors 12. The most attractive point of LnO1-xFxBiS2 is 
the pressure induced phase transition from a low-Tc phase to a high-Tc phase2, 13-16.  For instance, the Tc 
of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, which was synthesized by a conventional solid state reaction, is obtained at only 3 K. 
On the other hand, the Tc largely increases above 10 K by using high pressure synthesis. Furthermore, 
even if the sample is prepared by using a conventional solid state reaction method, high pressure 
measurements can enhance the Tc above 10 K 16. Very recently, we have reported the pressure induced 
phase transition for the single crystalline PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 17. From this study, it was found that the 
semiconducting-like behavior in low-Tc phase changes to the metallic behavior and the γ is reduced by 
around half after the phase transition.  
The modification of superconducting and blocking layers is one of the promising approaches to 
discover new superconducting materials 18. Polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was discovered by the 
replacement of the BiS2 superconducting layers in LaO1-xFxBiS2 to the BiSe2 layers 19. In such a material 
whether the pressure induced phase transition can be observed or not is a point of interest. Also it will 
provide useful information to know the mechanism of emergence for the high-Tc phase. In previous 
research, we have succeeded in preparing single crystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 and performing structural 
analysis of this compound 20. According to our previous study on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2
17, it was found that 
applying uniaxial pressure to single crystals effectively induces the high-Tc phase. Also, measurements 
using single crystals are suitable to investigate the intrinsic properties of these materials. In this research, 
we investigated the pressure induced phase transition of single crystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. 
The single crystals were prepared by the CsCl flux method. The details of characterization are shown 
in ref. 20. All described fluorine content in this article is the nominal amount. X-ray diffraction (XRD)

measurement showed that the single crystals were highly oriented to the c-axis as shown in Fig.1. The c 
lattice parameter was estimated to be 1.414(4) nm. Electrical resistivity was measured by a physical 
properties measurement system (PPMS) under varying pressures up to a maximum of 2.44 GPa. The 
measurement was performed by a standard four-probe method from 300 K to 2 K in a piston-cylinder-
type pressure cell. The measured sample was formed into rectangles with dimensions of around 1.3 × 
0.4 × 0.02 mm2. Since the thickness (20 μm) is smaller compared to the other dimensions, therefore the 
actual applied pressure should be almost uniaxial along the c-axis, despite the fact that we are using a 
hydrostatic pressure technique. This relationship between sample configuration and anisotropic pressure 
has been demonstrated previously in ref.21. The resistivity measurements were performed under several 
magnetic fields with directions both parallel to the ab plane (H//ab) and c axis (H//c), under 1.17 and 
2.44 GPa.  
The temperature dependence of resistivity for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 under various pressures is shown in 
figure 2 (a) and (b). The data points at ambient pressure were noisy due to poor contact resistance, but 
was improved by applied pressure. In this study, Tc
onset and Tc
zero were regarded as described in figure 2 
(b). The resistivity at ambient pressure and 0.76 GPa starts to decrease at 3.4 K and a second drop is 
observed at 2.4 K. Although the zero resistivity was not obtained at ambient pressure, Tc
zero appeared at 
2.2 K under 0.76 GPa. Additionally, a small hump at around 40 K is observed at ambient pressure and 
0.76 GPa. This hump was also confirmed in our previous report 22. When increasing pressure up to 1.17 
GPa, it completely disappears. However, even though the pressure increases up to 2.16 GPa, Tc
zero does 
not increase above 2.7 K. On the other hand, at 2.16 GPa, the resistivity starts to drop at 6.3 K and 
shows a step like behavior. This means that some of parts in the sample form the high-Tc phase. For 
further pressure up to 2.44 GPa, the Tc
onset clearly appears at 6.7 K and the Tc
zero suddenly increases up to 
5 K. From this figure, it is expected that the drop of resistivity at around 3 K corresponds to the low-Tc 
phase, and the high-Tc phase is obtained at around 7 K. However, under ambient pressure and 0.76 GPa, 


4 
 
another drop of resistivity is also observed at 2 K. This may be due to the inhomogeneous fluorine 
concentration, or a local distortion for the extreme thinness of the sample. 
In this measurement, we confirmed the discontinuous increase in Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, as was also 
observed with the BiS2 system. Therefore, regardless of whether the superconducting layers are made up 
of sulfur or selenium, a pressure induced phase transition occurs. Furthermore, in the high-Tc phase, the 
BiS2 and BiSe2 systems show similar behavior. Namely, the resistivity in the normal conducting state of 
the high-Tc phase gradually increases with increasing applied pressure17. On the other hand, in the low-
Tc phase, although the BiS2 system shows semiconducting-like behavior, the metallic behavior is 
observed in the BiSe2 system.  
The temperature dependences of resistivity under magnetic field along the c-axis and the ab plane 
were measured as shown in figure 3 (a)-(d). When the magnetic field is parallel to the c axis, 
superconductivity is drastically suppressed with increasing magnetic field. This is typical behavior 
observed in superconductors with a layered structure. Figure 4 shows the upper critical field (Hc2) versus 
temperature for the low- and high-Tc phase. To estimate the Hc2, 90 % of resistivity at Tc
onset is adopted 
as a criterion. In this article, Hc2 obtained from magnetic field H//ab and H//c are described as Hc2
//ab and 
Hc2
//c respectively. In addition, the γ, the coherence length at 0 K along the c axis (ξc (0)) and the ab-
plane (ξab (0)) are estimated from figure 4 by using following formula: γ = Hc2
//ab / Hc2
//c, Hc2
//c = 
Φ0/2πξab
2(0) and Hc2
//ab = Φ0/2πξab(0) ξc(0), where Φ0 is flux quantum. Obtained these superconducting 
parameters in low- and high-Tc phase are summarized in table I.  
Although the γ for the low-Tc phase is estimated to be 20, it is reduced by around half (9.3) in the 
high-Tc phase. This tendency is the same as in the BiS2 system19.  As mentioned above, the BiS2 and the 
BiSe2 systems showed very similar behavior under high pressure. It is suggested that these materials 
exhibit the same mechanism for the pressure induced phase transition. In the previous study of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, a pressure induced structural transition from tetragonal phase (P4/nmm) to monoclinic 


5 
 
phase (P21/m) was suggested from XRD analysis under high pressure 16. Such a kind of structural 
transition is one of the possible explanations for the pressure induced phase transition of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, 
since it has the same structure as LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 in low-Tc phase. Currently, high-pressure XRD 
measurements for the BiSe2 system have not yet been performed. Therefore, a detailed investigation for 
the structure of BiS2 and BiSe2 system may provide useful information for understanding the mechanism 
behind the high-Tc phase. 
Within recent days, a paper about LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was submitted to arXiv 23. it shows that the results 
of the resistivity measurements under high pressure are slightly different from our results. Although the 
pressure induced phase transition is also shown in that paper, in the low-Tc phase, the Tc gradually 
decreases with increasing applied pressure 23. This different behavior in low-Tc phase may be due to the 
difference of the fluorine concentration between our samples and the reported samples.  
In summary, we revealed that the Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 discontinuously increases. Although our 
sample does not show zero resistivity at ambient pressure, by applying pressure up to 2.44 GPa, 
maximum Tc
onset and Tc
zero were observed at 6.7 K and 5 K. The resistivity of both low- and high-Tc 
phases shows metallic behavior. This is very different from what was seen in the BiS2 system. The γ 
extremely decreases from 20 to 9.3 after the phase transition, and the resistivity of the normal 
conducting state in high-Tc phase gradually increases with increasing applied pressure which is in 
accordance with the BiS2 system. In this current stage, the optimal Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was not 
observed even at the maximum pressure obtained during this study. Therefore applied further pressure 
has the potential to induce a much higher Tc in this system.
