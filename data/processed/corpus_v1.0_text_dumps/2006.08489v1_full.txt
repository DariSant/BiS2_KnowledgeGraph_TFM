Polycrystalline samples of Sr1-xRExFBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) were synthesized via the solid-
state reaction and characterized using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Although all the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 
samples exhibited superconductivity at transition temperatures (Tc) within the range of 2.1–2.7 K under 
ambient pressure, the estimated superconducting volume fraction was small. This indicated the non-
bulk nature of superconductivity in these samples under ambient pressure. A dramatic evolution of the 
bulk superconducting phases was achieved on applying an external hydrostatic pressure. Near 
pressures below 1 GPa, bulk superconductivity was induced with a Tc of 2.5–2.8 K, which is termed 
as the low-P phase. Moreover, the high-P phase (Tc = 10.0–10.8 K) featuring bulk characteristics was 
observed at higher pressures. Pressure-Tc phase diagrams indicated that the critical pressure for the 
emergence of the high-P phase tends to increase with decreasing ionic radius of the doped RE ions. 
According to the high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, a structural phase 
transition from tetragonal to monoclinic also occurred at approximately 1.1 GPa. Thus, this phase 
transition indicates a pressure-induced superconducting–superconducting transition similar to the 
transition in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Bulk superconducting phases in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 induced by the external 
hydrostatic pressure effect are expected to be useful for evaluating the mechanisms of 
superconductivity in BiCh2-based superconductors. 
 
 
 
 


Introduction 
The discovery of superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds such as Bi4O4S3 and REO1-xFxBiS2 has 
triggered numerous studies focusing on identifying new superconductors featuring a higher transition 
temperatures (Tc) and elucidating the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds. Due 
to the similarity between the crystal structures of cuprates and iron-based compounds1,2, BiS2-based 
compounds have been considered as a type of layered superconductors. Thus far, various types of BiS2-
based compounds have been synthesized by replacing different blocking layers3-14, such as the 
Bi4O4(SO4)1-x or (REO) (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) layers. By manipulating the layered structures, 
the replacement of (REO) blocking layers with the SrF blocking layers enabled the development of a 
new class of BiS2-based Sr1-xRExFBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) compounds12, 15–21. The parent 
compound is SrFBiS2, which is a semiconductor with a band gap. The substitution of Sr2+ with RE3+ 
induces electron carriers in the BiS2 layer, and filamentary superconductivity appears at approximately 
2.8 K in La-, Pr-, and Ce-doped compounds12, 17–19.  
Notably, some BiS2-based compounds do not exhibit bulk superconductivity even after electron 
doping. To induce bulk superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds, various chemical substitutions 
have been attempted22–24. Among these, the iso-valent substitutions, such as Nd3+ substitutions for La3+ 
or Se2- substitutions for S2-, were found to be effective for inducing bulk superconductivity. Based on 
systematic structural analyses, we have revealed that the in-plane chemical pressure is one of the 
essential parameters that facilitate the emergence of bulk superconductivity in BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) 
systems25,26. 
Regarding the superconducting mechanisms, unconventional pairing mechanisms were suggested 
based on the recent first principal calculations27–29. In addition, angle-resolved photoemission 
spectroscopy (ARPES) has revealed a strongly anisotropic superconducting gap or the possibility of 
sign changes in the superconducting gap30. Recently, we have reported the absence of isotope effects 
on Tc in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe31, and the two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in 
the superconducting states in tetragonal LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe with a four-fold-symmetric in-plane 
structure32. This is likely related to nematic superconductivity states, which have been observed in 
several unconventional superconductors33. These findings indicate the emergence of unconventional 
superconducting states in the RE(O,F)BiCh2 system. Therefore, in order to further investigate the 
superconducting mechanisms of BiCh2-based compounds, it is essential to develop a new BiCh2-based 
system. 
In this study, we focus on the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) system. Based on 
electrical resistivity measurements conducted under high pressures, a considerable increase in Tc was 
observed in previous pressure experiments15–17. The highest Tc in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 is approximately 10 
K, and the pressure dependences of Tc exhibits a sharp increase at the critical pressure (~ 1 GPa). It 
was suggested that the significant increase in Tc under pressure in BiS2-based systems was associated 
with a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic, which was revealed via structural analyses 
of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and EuFBiS234,35. Although there has been no further report on the pressure-induced 


superconductivity in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2, we assumed that a similar structural transition occurs in its case 
as well. Considering these facts and assumptions regarding the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 system, we performed 
magnetization measurements on the system under high pressures in order to obtain information 
regarding the superconducting characteristics of both the low-P and high-P phases. Here, we present 
the evolution of two bulk superconducting phases: the low-P and high-P phases. Furthermore, we 
characterized the crystal structure of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 under high pressures; accordingly, a possible 
structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic was observed at approximately 1.1 GPa.  
  
Results 
Sample characterization and physical properties at ambient pressure 
Fig. 1 depicts the powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2. For Sr1-
xRExFBiS2 (RE = Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm), see supplemental Fig. S1 (a-d). The crystal structure of the 
obtained samples was well refined using the Rietveld method. They were well refined using a 
tetragonal structure with the P4/nmm space group. Small impurity peaks due to REF3 (RE: La, Ce) and 
Bi2S3 were also detected in the case of the Pr, Nd, Sm-based samples. As shown in Fig. 2, we observed 
that the lattice constant a decreased with decreasing RE ionic radius; however, the lattice constant c 
increased under these conditions. The obtained values were in agreement with previous reports12, 16. 
The chemical composition ratios of the samples were determined using energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX). These results showed that the chemical compositions of the obtained samples 
were in reasonable agreement with the nominal compositions (Table 1). The electrical resistivity of the 
samples at ambient pressure was measured to be 1.6 K (Fig. 3). The semiconducting behaviour in all 
the samples was observed; moreover, the ρ-T curve indicated a slight increase in ρ on cooling, which 
implied that the conduction electrons were weakly localized due to the in-plane local disorder in the 
BiS2 layer. A superconducting transition was observed at Tc = 2.7, 2.7, 2.6, 2.6, and 2.1 K for RE = La, 
Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm, respectively (Fig. 3 inset). In addition, a superconducting transition was also 
observed in the temperature dependence of magnetization, as plotted in Fig. 4. The Tc estimated based 
on magnetization was in agreement with that obtained based on the resistivity measurements. This is 
the first study to report on the observation of superconductivity in Sr0.5Nd0.5FBiS2 and Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 
under ambient pressure. However, in these samples, the estimated shielding volume fraction was less 
than 6%. To obtain bulk superconductivity, which is essentially important for describing intrinsic 
superconducting properties, we applied external pressure on the samples. 
 
External pressure effect 
Fig. 5 (a) shows the temperature dependences of the magnetization of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 when 
increasing the applied pressure to 1.15 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature of 
approximately 2.7 K (low-P phase) remained almost unchanged up to 0.84 GPa; alternatively, there 
was an evident increase in the shielding volume fraction. This result indicates that the external pressure 
effectively enhances the shielding volume fraction, which corresponds to the bulk nature of the 


superconducting states in the Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 samples. A remarkable increase in Tc up to Tcmax = 10.8 
K (high-P phase) was observed at P > 0.95 GPa. This maximum value of Tc is comparable to that 
obtained for a high-P phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS234,37–39 and Sr0.5La0.5FBiS215,40 through resistivity 
measurements under high pressure. The enhancement in the shielding volume fraction was also 
observed in the high-P phase, which was achieved by increasing the applied pressure to the maximum 
pressure, without a noticeable change in the Tc. Moreover, a similar trend was observed in the low-P 
region. The drastic increase in Tc is likely related to the structural transition from a tetragonal to a 
monoclinic phase, which was suggested for the related superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 based on the 
XRD under high pressure34. The pressure dependence of Tc is summarized in Fig. 5 (f); the light blue, 
blue, and pink regions indicate the filamentary superconductivity, bulk superconductivity in the low-
P phase, and bulk superconductivity in the high-P phase, respectively. The low-P phase shifts to the 
high-P phase when a pressure slightly exceeding the critical pressure (Pc) for the high-P phase is 
applied. In regard to this, a phase diagram was created using the shielding volume fraction of 20% or 
more as a bulk state in order to discuss the phase transition. In the pressure range of 0–0.84 GPa, Tc(P) 
remains almost constant (~ 2.7 K). The bulk superconductivity of the sample was induced by the 
pressure for the low-P phase region; eventually, the high-P phase region emerged at approximately P 
= 0.95 GPa with the bulk superconducting states. The Tc(P) for the high-P phase region is almost 
constant (10.8 K). The temperature dependence of magnetization under pressure and the pressure 
dependence of Tc phases for all the samples are summarized in Fig. 5 (a-e) and (f-j), respectively. The 
high-P phase of Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 was not observed up to 1.28 GPa, which is nearly the upper limit of 
the pressure measurement apparatus used in this experiment. This is the first report offering evidence 
of the bulk nature of two different (low- and high-P) phases of the Sr1-xRExFBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, 
and Sm) superconductors when subjected to pressure.  
 
Discussion 
In this section, we discuss the relationship between external pressure effects, chemical pressure 
effects, and evolution of superconductivity in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2. On comparing the evolutions of 
superconductivity for RE = Ce–Sm and that for RE = La, a slight decrease in Tc for the low-P phase 
was observed with increasing pressure for the RE = Ce, Pr, Nd and, Sm samples. This deviation in the 
behaviour might be explained by the effect of coexistence of both the external as well as chemical 
pressures25. Moreover, we observed that the Tc of the high-P phase varied slightly with the RE ionic 
radius. On the contrary, the Pc for the high-P phase increased with decreasing RE ionic radius. 
Specifically, assuming a coordination number of 8, Pc was roughly estimated as 0.95, 1.11, 1.17, and 
1.33 GPa for La3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.16 Å), Ce3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.14 Å), Pr3+ (with an 
ionic radius of 1.13 Å), and Nd3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.11 Å), respectively. The tendency of the 
increase in Pc and the decrease in Tc with a decrease in RE ionic radius was also observed for 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds38,39,40; specifically, the Tc varied from approximately 10 K to 6 K, and a 
significantly higher Pc was required with decreasing RE ionic radius. These observations highlight the 


relationship between the structural transition to monoclinic and the packing density in the BiS2 
conducting layers34. It is possible that the larger space along the BiS conduction plane with a larger RE 
ionic radius possibly transmits the pressure, thereby inducing structural transition. As shown in Fig. 6, 
Tcmag of all samples for the low- and high-P phases were plotted with respect to the lattice constant a. 
Tc of the high-P phase was defined as the highest Tc for the range of applied pressures, whereas Tc of 
the low-P phase was defined as the value of Tc when the applied pressure is lower than the pressure 
for the emergency of the high-P phase. A slightly increasing trend in Tc was observed for both low- 
and high-P phases with increasing lattice constant a estimated under an ambient pressure. 
Fig. 7 (a) presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 at room temperature under 
various applied pressures of up to 3.4 GPa. Shifts of the (001) and (004) peaks to higher angles clearly 
indicate the shrinkage of the lattice along the c-axis due to the pressure. In contrast, a relatively smaller 
shift of the (110) peak was detected, which indicates that the in-plane size remains almost unchanged. 
Strong peak broadening was observed for the (200) peak above 1.1 GPa, indicating peak splitting due 
to the lowering of in-plane structural symmetry. Similar peak splitting on the (200) peak was observed 
for isostructural LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and EuFBiS2 samples under high pressure34,35,41, and a resultant 
structural transition from a tetragonal to monoclinic phase was detected. We noticed that the (200) 
peak asymmetrically split into two or more peaks, as depicted in Fig. 7 (b). This may be due to the 
inhomogeneity of applied pressure and the flexible nature of the in-plane structure of BiS2-based 
compounds. The critical pressure of 1.1 GPa estimated from the XRD corresponds satisfactorily with 
the Pc estimated from the magnetization measurements. 
 
Conclusion 
Herein, we report on the results of the crystal structure, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility under 
pressure for (Sr,RE)FBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm). The effects of external pressure on 
magnetization resulted in abrupt increments in Tc up to 10–10.8 K, for samples with RE = La, Ce, Pr, 
and Nd. Based on analyses of the shielding volume fraction estimated via magnetic susceptibility 
measurements, we found that two bulk superconductivity phases (low-P and high-P phases) existed 
for (Sr,RE)FBiS2. The common features were that the bulk low-P phase was induced by external 
pressure, whereas the bulk high-P phase was induced at pressures exceeding a critical pressure. 
Moreover, at the critical pressure, Tc sharply increased to the high-P phase as our experiment shifted 
to higher pressures with decreasing RE ionic radius; this implied that both the external as well as 
chemical pressures were affecting Tc. In addition, we investigated the variations in the crystal structure 
under pressure. By analysing the splitting of the (200) peak, we concluded that the high-P phase was 
a monoclinic structure. Various bulk superconducting phases with different space group induced via 
external pressure effects in (Sr,RE)FBiS2 need to be further investigated in order to elucidate the 
mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based systems.  
Methods 
Polycrystalline Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) samples were synthesized by solid state 


reaction method in an evacuated quartz tube. Powders of RE2S3(RE: La (99.9%), Ce (99.9%), Pr (99%), 
Nd (99%), and Sm (99.9%)), SrF2 (99%), Bi (99.999%), and S (99.9999%) were weighed for 
Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2. The mixed powder was subsequently pelletized, sintered in an evacuated quartz tube 
at 700oC for 20 hours, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The obtained compounds 
were thoroughly mixed and ground, then sintered in the same conditions at the first sintering. 
The phase purity and the crystal structure of the Sr1-xRExFBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm) samples 
were examined by powder synchrotron XRD with an energy of 25 keV (λ = 0.49657 Å) at the beamline 
BL02B2 of SPring-8 under a proposal No. 2019A1101. The synchrotron XRD experiments were 
performed at room temperature with a sample rotator system, and the diffraction data were collected 
using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector MYTHEN [Multiple mythen system] 
with a step of 2θ = 0.006o. To investigate the crystal structure of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, XRD experiments 
under high pressure up to 3.4 GPa were performed at room temperature using a Mo-Kα radiation on a 
Rigaku (MicroMax-007HF) rotating anode generator equipped with a 100 µm collimator. Daphne 
7474 was used as a pressure medium. 
The crystal structure parameters were refined using the Rietveld method with a RIETAN-FP 
software36. The actual compositions of the obtained samples were analyzed using an energy dispersive 
X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on TM-3030 (Hitachi).  
The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility at ambient pressure and under high 
pressures were measured using a superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) with MPMS-
3 (Quantum Design). Hydrostatic pressures were generated by the MPMS high pressure Capsule Cell. 
The sample was immersed in a pressure transmitting medium (Daphene 7373) covered with a Teflon 
cell. The pressure at low temperature was calibrated from the superconducting transition temperature 
of Pb manometer. The electrical resistivity was measured on a GM refrigerator system (Made by Axis) 
using a conventional four-probe method. For the resistivity measurements, gold wires were connected 
to the samples with a silver paste.
