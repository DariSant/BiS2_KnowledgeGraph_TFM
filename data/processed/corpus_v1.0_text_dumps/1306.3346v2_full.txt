Abstract 
 
Correlation between crystal structure and superconducting properties of the 
BiS2-based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 was investigated. We have prepared 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples with various lattice constants. It was found that 
the annealing the sample under high pressure generated uniaxial strain along the c 
axis. Further, the highly-strained sample showed higher superconducting properties. 
We concluded that the uniaxial strain along the c axis was positively linked with the 
enhancement of superconductivity in the LaO1-xFxBiS2 system.

Introduction 
 
The layered crystal structure is one of the notable stages to explore new 
superconductors with a high transition temperature (Tc) and to discuss the mechanism 
of 
unconventional 
superconductivity. 
Recently, 
several 
kinds 
of 
BiS2-based 
superconductors such as Bi4O4S3 and REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = rare earth), which possess the 
BiS2 conduction layers, have been discovered [1-6]. The crystal structure of the 
BiS2-based superconductors is composed of an alternate stacking of conduction layers 
and blocking layers. This is quite similar to the crystal structure of the cuprates and the 
Fe-based superconductors [7,8]. Therefore, it is expected that new BiS2-based 
superconductors with high Tc would be discovered. The parent phase of the BiS2-based 
family is basically an insulator with Bi3+, and superconductivity in BiS2-based materials 
is emerged by electron doping to the Bi-6p orbital within the BiS2 layers [1,9]. Among 
them, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has the highest Tc. Although the Tc (onset) of the As-grown 
(solid-state-reacted) LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is only 3 K, it can be enhanced to 10.6 K by applying 
annealing under high pressure. It was found that the crystal structure obviously 
changed after high-pressure annealing, indicating that the superconducting properties 
depended on not only the carrier concentration but also the changes in crystal structure 
[2, 10, 11]. However, the correlation between the superconducting properties and the 
crystal structure remains to be clarified. Here, we show that the superconducting 
properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be tuned with changing the lattice constants. In 
particular, the uniaxial strain is important for the appearance of higher Tc in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
 
Experimental 
 Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were prepared by solid-state 
reaction using powders of La2S3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.9%), BiF3(99.9%), Bi2S3 and grains of 
Bi (99.99%). The Bi2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Bi (99.99%) and S (99.99%) 
grains at 500 ºC in an evacuated quartz tube. The starting materials with a nominal 
composition of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were well-mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed into an 
evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700 ºC for 10h; here we call this sample “As-grown” 
sample. 
As reported in refs. 2 and 11, the Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is enhanced by annealing 
the as-grown sample under high pressure. Therefore, the obtained sample was annealed 
at 600 ºC under high pressure (HP) of 2 GPa using a cubic-anvil high-pressure synthesis 
instrument. Here we call this product “HP” sample.

To investigate intermediate specimens, we annealed the HP sample in an 
evacuated quartz tube at various temperatures because annealing could generally 
reduce the strain. Hence, to realize tuning of crystal structure, the obtained “HP” 
sample was cut into several pieces, separately sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and 
annealed at 300, 500 and 700 ºC for 10 hours, where the heating rate was fixed at 200 ºC / h, 
respectively. The samples were furnace-cooled down to room temperature. These samples are called 
with the annealing temperature, for example, “300 ºC sample” for the sample annealed at 300 ºC. 
The powder X-ray diffraction experiments were carried out using a Rigaku 
SmartLab powder diffractometer equipped with a CuK monochrometer. To compare 
XRD patterns of various samples precisely, the standard Si powder was mixed with the 
samples, and used as the reference of the calibration of the peak shift. The obtained 
X-ray diffraction patterns were analyzed using the Rietveld method. The temperature 
dependence of electrical resistivity from 300 to 2 K was measured using the 
four-terminal method. The DC magnetic susceptibility was measured using a 
superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer after zero-field 
cooling (ZFC) with an applied field of ~5 Oe. The transition temperature (Tcmag) was 
defined to be a temperature at which the signal of diamagnetic susceptibility reached 
1 % of -1/4. The microstructures were investigated using a scanning electron 
microscope (SEM). 
 
 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1(a) and 1(b) show powder X-ray diffraction patterns of the As-grown 
sample and the 700 ºC sample, respectively. These diffraction patterns were reasonably 
fitted by parameters of the space group of P4/nmm, which were analyzed by using 
RIETAN-FP [12]. The obtained lattice constants were a = 4.0710(1) Å, c = 13.3495(3) Å 
for the As-grown sample, a = 4.0718(1) Å, c = 13.3780(3) Å for the 700 ºC sample. The R 
factors of the Rietveld refinement were obtained as Rwp = 13.3 %, Re = 7.1 % (S = 1.8) for 
the As-grown sample, Rwp = 10.2 %, Re = 5.7 % (S = 1.8) for the 700 ºC sample, 
respectively. The resulting structure parameters are listed in Tabs. 1 and 2. There is no 
large change in crystal structure between the As-grown sample and the 700 ºC sample, 
indicating both the annealing under HP (2 GPa, 600 ºC) and the post annealing at 700 
ºC in evacuated tube do not change the space group and do not produce impurities. For the HP, 
300, 500 ºC samples, we did not obtain reliable refinements, because of the peak 
broadening. However, clear shifts of peak positions in the X-ray diffraction profiles were 
observed. This indicates the lattice is strained by applying HP annealing, but returned 


4 
 
by the post annealing the sample at 700 ºC in an evacuated tube. 
To investigate the characteristics of the generated strain after the HP 
annealing, the enlargement of X-ray profiles around the (004) peaks and the (200) peaks 
for all the samples are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. We find that the peaks 
of the HP sample are obviously broader than that of the As-grown sample. Then, the 
peaks become sharper with applying post annealing at 300, 500 and 700 ºC. Finally, the 
X-ray profile of the 700 ºC sample becomes comparable to that of the As-grown sample as 
confirmed in Fig 1. The (004) peak shifts to higher angles, which indicates large 
contraction of the c axis with applying HP annealing. In contrast, the (200) peak slightly 
shifts to lower angles after the HP annealing, indicating slight expansion of the a axis. 
Due to the asymmetric peaks, the reliable estimation of the lattice constants for the HP, 
300 and 500 ºC samples are difficult. However, to discuss the change in lattice constants 
qualitatively, the lattice constants were calculated using the peak positions at the 
maximum intensity in the (004) and (200) peaks, and summarized in the insets of Figs. 
2(a) and 2(b). In the calculation of the lattice constants, the peak-shift parameters 
estimated by the Rietveld refinement for the As-grown sample were used. It is clear that 
the length of the a axis decreases and the length of the c axis increases with applying 
HP annealing. In addition, we find that the peak symmetry is different in between the 
(00l) and (h00) peaks. the broadening of the (004) peak is relatively large, and the peaks 
are asymmetric. In contrast, the broadening of the (200) peak is small, and the 
broadened peaks are almost symmetric. These facts suggest that the c axis is easily 
compressed, and the uniaxial strain (compression) along the c axis is generated after 
HP annealing in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. 
Figure 3 (a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for all 
the samples. For all the samples, resistivity increases with decreasing temperature; 
namely, transport properties are semiconducting-like even though the electron carriers 
are introduced in the conduction layers upon F substitution at the O site. The resistivity 
at 300 K for the As-grown sample is the highest, and the resistivity at 300 K becomes 
lower by applying HP annealing. The application of the post annealing at 500 and 700 
ºC enhances the value of resistivity at 300 K. To compare the Tc for all the samples, the temperature 
dependence of resistivity was normalized at 15 K and displayed in Fig. 3 (b). The HP sample shows 
the highest transition temperature of Tc
zero = 7.0 K. With applying post annealing at 300, 500 and 700 
ºC, Tc decreases with increasing post-annealing temperature. Finally, the Tc for the 700 ºC sample 
almost corresponds with that of the As-grown sample, which is consistent with the X-ray diffraction 
results. In this regard, the Tc in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system is governed by the change in crystal 
structure such as lattice strain.

Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (ZFC) for all the 
samples. The As-grown sample shows weak superconducting (diamagnetic) signal with Tc
mag = 2.4 
K. The HP sample shows the highest Tc
mag of 6.9 K with a large shielding volume fraction. With 
increasing post-annealing temperature, the Tc decreases as observed in the resistivity measurements, 
and the shielding volume fraction decreases in the 500 and 700 ºC sample. Thus, the uniaxial strain 
generated by applying HP annealing affects not only Tc but also the shielding property. 
The change in microstructure due to the generation of strain was investigated 
by the SEM observation. Figure 5 (a) and (b) display the SEM images for the As-grown 
and the HP samples, respectively. For the As-grown sample, grains with a size of several 
m are observed. In Fig. 5 (b), it is found that the grain size for the HP sample is 
smaller than that for the As-grown sample. Further, the surface of the HP sample seems 
to be amorphous-like. These changes should be resulted from the application of the HP 
annealing, in other words, the generation of uniaxial strain. 
 
Finally, we summarize and discuss the evolution of superconductivity and 
structural changes in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. On the basis of the X-ray diffraction, 
resistivity and susceptibility measurements for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples prepared by 
various annealing conditions, we conclude that the uniaxial compression along to the c 
axis is essential for both the appearance of bulk superconductivity and higher Tc. In fact, 
this scenario is consistent with the theoretical study by Suzuki et al., which suggests 
that the band structure depends on the distance between La in the blocking layer and S 
in the BiS2 layers [13]. The uniaxial compression along to the c axis should affect the 
band structure. Hence, the superconducting properties might be strongly enhanced, 
probably due to the enhancement of density of states near the Fermi level. The other 
possibility to explain the evolution of superconductivity is improvement of the 
localization of electron carriers. As mentioned above, this system shows anomalous 
metallic behavior. Furthermore, theoretical studies predict that a charge-density-wave 
stability exists in the BiS2-based family [14,15]. Therefore, it is possible that the 
uniaxial strain suppress an ordered state such as a charge-density-wave state. To obtain 
more detailed information on a relationship between crystal structure and 
superconducting properties in the BiS2-based superconductor, crystal structural 
analysis using single crystals under high pressure is needed. 
 
Conclusion 
 
The correlation between crystal structure and superconducting properties of 
the BiS2-based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has been investigated. We have 
synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples with various annealing conditions

up to 3 steps. The HP annealing generates uniaxial strain along the c axis. The 
generated strain is returned to the initial state of the As-grown sample by annealing the 
sample in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 ºC. The highest superconducting properties, 
Tc and shielding fraction, are observed in the HP sample, and the superconducting 
properties is degraded by reducing the uniaxial strain. On the basis of those results, we 
conclude that the enhancement of the superconducting properties in LaO1-xFxBiS2 by 
applying post-annealing under high pressure is caused by the generation of the uniaxial 
strain along the c axis.
