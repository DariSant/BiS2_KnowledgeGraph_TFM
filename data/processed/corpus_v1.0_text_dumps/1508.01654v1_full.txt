A new BiS2-based superconductor Bi2(O,F)S2 was discovered.  This is a layered 
compound consisting of alternate stacking structure of rock-salt-type BiS2 
superconducting layer and fluorite-type Bi(O,F) blocking layer.  Bi2(O,F)S2 was 
obtained as the main phase by topotactic fluorination of undoped Bi2OS2 using XeF2, 
which is the first topotactic synthesis of an electron-doped superconductor via reductive 
fluorination.  With increasing F-content, a- and c-axis length increased and decreased, 
respectively, and Tc increased up to 5.1 K.

   Since the discovery of superconductivity in LaFeAs(O,F) with superconducting 
transition temperature (Tc) of 26 K1), superconductivity in novel layered compounds have 
attracted intense attention.  Consequently, several new layered superconductors with 
Ti2O plane (ex. Ba2Ti2Sb2O with Tc = 1.2 K2)), and BiS2 layer (ex. Bi4O4S3 with Tc = 8.3 
K3)) are recently discovered.  Some of these newly discovered superconductors, such as 
iron-based superconductors REFeAs(O,F)1 and BiS2-based superconductors RE(O,F)BiS2 
(RE = La4), Ce5), Pr6) and Nd7)), contains fluorite-type RE(O,F) blocking layers.  In these 
cases, undoped REFeAsO and REOBiS2 does not show superconductivity and partial 
substitution of F- for the O2- site causes electron-doped superconductivity in the FeAs and 
BiS2 layer. 
Not only rare earth metals, but also Bi forms fluorite-type BiO layer.  Among the 
BiS2-based superconductors reported to date, Bi4O4S33) and Bi3O2S38)9) contains fluorite-
type BiO layer in the blocking layer.  In addition, Bi2OS2 (i.e. BiOBiS2) is isostructural 
with REOBiS2, consisting of rock-salt-type BiS2 layer and fluorite-type BiO layer, as 
shown in Fig.1.  This compound was synthesized first by Phelan et al. in 2013 and 
reported to be a non-superconductor8).  However, no further investigation on physical 
properties of this compound has been reported, while partial substitution of F- for the O2- 
site of fluorite-type BiO layer might lead to superconductivity.   
In general, conventional solid-state reaction has been usually adopted for introduction 
of fluorine to oxides, where metal fluorides and other raw or precursor materials are 
mixed at the stoichiometric composition of the objective substance and reacted at high 
temperatures.  On the other hand, various topotactic fluorination reactions have also 
been reported to date, mainly on transition metal oxides having perovskite-type structures, 
where precursor oxides reacts on fluorinating agents, such as F2 gas 10), XeF211),12), 
NH4F 13 ), MF2 (M = Ni, Cu, Zn, Ag) 14 ), poly (vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) 15 ), and 
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)16).  When F- is inserted to the interstitial site of the 
transition metal oxide, oxidation state of the transition metal increases.  This type of 
reaction; topotactic oxidative fluorination, is sometimes adopted to prepare hole-doped 
high-Tc cuprates, such as Sr2CuO2F2+10), 12)-14).  On the contrary, when F- is partially 
substituted for the O2- site, the oxidation state of transition metal decreases.  Synthesis 
of several oxyfluorides, such as CrOF311), RbLaNb2O6F16) and Sr3Fe2(O,F)717), were 
reported via this route, i.e. topotactic reductive fluorination, but any superconductors have 
never been discovered through this method. 
In the present Letter, synthesis and properties of F-doped Bi2OS2 are reported.  
Bi2(O,F)S2 was successfully synthesized by topotactic reaction between undoped Bi2OS2 
and XeF2, and showed superconductivity with Tc = 5.1 K.  This is the first topotactic 


3 
 
reductive fluorination resulting in an electron-doped superconductor. 
   Undoped Bi2OS2 was synthesized by the solid-state reaction.  Bi2O3 (Furuuchi 
Chemical, 99.9%) and Bi2S3 (ALDRICH, 99%) powders were weighed at the 
stoichiometric composition of Bi2OS2, mixed, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz 
ampoule and heated at 300~600°C with several times of regrinding process.  Bi2(O,F)S2 
was prepared by two different methods.  The first procedure is simple solid-state 
reaction.  Powders of Bi2O3, Bi2S3, BiF3 (Kojundo Chemical Laboratory, 99.9%) and Bi 
(Furuuchi Chemical, 99.9%) were mixed at the nominal compositions of Bi2(O1-xFx)S2 
and heated at 300 ~ 500°C for 12 ~ 100 h with intermediate grindings.  The second 
procedure is the topotactic reaction between undoped Bi2OS2 and XeF2.  Undoped 
Bi2OS2 synthesized by solid-state reaction and XeF2 (Matrix Scientific, 99%) powder 
were weighed, mixed, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz ampoule and heated at 
100 ~ 450°C for 24 ~ 72 h to form Bi2(O,F)S2.  Note that during the mixing and 
pelletizing process, the mixture easily causes explosion thus careful treatment under Ar-
filled glove box was mandatory.  
   The constituent phases of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
measurement (RIGAKU Ultima-IV) with Cu-K radiation generated at 40 kV and 40 mA.  
Silicon powder was used as the internal standard to determine the lattice parameters.  
Measurements of magnetization and resistivity were performed by a SQUID 
magnetometer (Quantum Design MPMS-XL5s) and by the AC four-probe method using 
the Quantum Design PPMS, respectively.  The thermoelectric power was measured by 
the steady-state method.   
   Undoped Bi2OS2 polycrystalline bulks with almost single phase were obtained by 
sintering at 300°C for ~100 h with two or three times of intermediate grindings as shown 
in Fig. 2.  The diffraction peaks were well indexed to the space group P4/nmm, and the 
lattice constants were calculated to be a = 3.961 Å and c = 13.808 Å.  Small amount of 
impurity phases, such as Bi2S3 and Bi, always remained in this study. 
   Bi2(O1-xFx)S2 was at first synthesized by the conventional solid-state reaction using 
BiF3 as a fluorine source.  For a sample with x = 0.3, Bi2(O,F)S2 formed with a lot of 
impurity phase of BiOF, Bi2S3 and Bi as shown in Fig. 2.  Lattice constants were 
calculated to be a = 3.969 Å and c = 13.769 Å, which are different from those of undoped 
Bi2OS2, suggesting partial substitution of F- for the O2- site.  This sample showed large 
diamagnetic signal below ~4 K in the zero-field-cooled (ZFC) magnetization 
measurement under 1 Oe.  When x is increased to 0.5, the sample contained only BiOF, 
Bi2S3 and Bi.  This sample and undoped Bi2OS2 sample did not show large 
diamagnetism above 2 K, while very small diamagnetism without temperature 


4 
 
dependence was observed possibly due to the diamagnetism of Bi, which is not related to 
superconductivity.   
   In order to obtain Bi2(O,F)S2 with higher purity and evaluate more intrinsic 
superconducting properties, we employed different synthesis route; topotactic reaction 
between undoped Bi2OS2 and XeF2.  We expected that reductive fluorination occurs in 
the present case according to the following chemical reaction:  
 
Bi2OS2 (s) + (x/2) XeF2 (s)  Bi2(O1-xFx)S2 (s) + (x/2) Xe (g) + (x/2) O2 (g).     (1) 
 
Fig. 2 shows the XRD patterns of the samples synthesized via the topotactic reaction 
at 400°C for 72 h.  Bi2(O,F)S2 is obtained as the main phase and amounts of co-existing 
impurity phases were largely reduced compared to the samples synthesized via 
conventional solid-state reaction.  With an increase in nominal XeF2 content up to ~30 
mol% (x/2 = 0.3) of the Bi2OS2, the a-axis length slightly increased while the c-axis length 
largely decreased.  This systematic change of lattice parameter indicates that the fluorine 
content is successfully varied by changing the nominal XeF2 content, though investigation 
of actual fluorine content is difficult due to small difference in X-ray scattering factors 
between O and F.  The actual fluorine concentrations in the samples are considered to 
be lower than the nominal x, because part of XeF2 is considered to decompose into gases 
of Xe and F2 before reacting with Bi2OS2.  Nevertheless, we are sure that partial 
substitution of F- for the O2- site occurred in this case, following the reaction equation (1), 
and oxidation state of Bi is reduced by this reaction.  One reason is the systematic 
changes of lattice parameters as described above.  Both topotactic fluorination and 
fluorine doping via conventional solid-state reaction caused similar change of lattice 
parameters: expansion of a-axis and contraction of c-axis lengths.  Large contraction of 
c-axis length by F- doping is consistent with the case of other RE(O,F)BiS2 electron-doped 
superconductors4)-7), suggesting that electron doping is successfully achieved in Bi2OS2 
by topotactic fluorination.  The results of thermoelectric power measurement shown in 
Fig. 3 strongly support this idea.  Seebeck coefficient of both undoped and topotactically 
fluorinated Bi2OS2 are negative in the temperature range of 4.2 to 300 K and the absolute 
value of the thermoelectric power significantly decreased in Bi2(O,F)S2.  At 300 K, 
Seebeck coefficient of undoped Bi2OS2 is ~70 VK-1, while that of Bi2(O,F)S2 fluorinated 
by XeF2 with 50 mol% of Bi2OS2 is ~30 VK-1, indicating increase of electron type 
charge carriers. 
Fig. 4(a) shows ZFC and field-cooled (FC) magnetization curves of Bi2(O,F)S2 
samples with x/2 = 0.1 and 0.3 prepared by topotactic fluorination.  Since both samples 


5 
 
exhibited very sharp transition and perfect diamagnetism, Bi2(O,F)S2 is concluded to be 
the bulk superconductor.  Tc increases up to 5.1 K as increasing nominal XeF2 content 
up to ~30 mol% of the undoped Bi2OS2.  Fig. 4(b) shows the temperature dependence 
of resistivity measured for a sample with x/2 = 0.3.  Very sharp superconducting 
transition within 0.4 K and zero resistivity at 4.8 K is observed under 0 T, while 
superconductivity is rapidly suppressed in magnetic fields and resistivity drop were not 
observed above 2 K under 3 T.  The behavior of normal state resistivity seems metallic, 
contrary to the semiconducting behavior observed in polycrystalline samples of 
RE(O,F)BiS24)-7).  However, our sample contains small impurity of Bi metal, which 
might affect the normal state resistivity.  Therefore, intrinsic behavior of normal state 
transport of this compound remains unrevealed. 
Even when nominal XeF2 content was increased up to ~50 mol% of Bi2OS2, the result 
was almost the same as the case when nominal XeF2 content was ~30 mol%, probably 
owing to solubility limit of F- for the O2- site.  Changing reaction temperature did not 
lead to increase of fluorine content.  The sample reacted at 200~300°C also showed 
superconductivity below 4 ~ 5 K.  Their superconducting transitions were broader with 
smaller superconducting volume fraction at ~2 K compared to the samples reacted for 
400°C, suggesting insufficient substitution of fluorine.  The sample reacted at lower than 
200°C did not show apparent diamagnetism due to superconductivity.  On the other hand, 
the reaction at 450°C lead to the decomposition of Bi2OS2 phase. 
The a-axis length of Bi2(O,F)S2 is shorter than other isostructural RE(O,F)BiS24)-7) 
and (Sr,La)FBiS218).  In RE(O,F)BiS2, a-axis shrinks and Tc increases with increasing 
atomic number of RE from La to Nd4)-7).  The Tc of Bi2(O,F)S2 (5.1 K) is higher than 
those of RE(O,F)BiS2 with RE = La ~ Pr and comparable to that of Nd(O,F)BiS2 (5.2 K) 
7).  It seems that smaller a-axis length is preferable for higher Tc in MOBiS2 synthesized 
under ambient pressure.  However, La(O,F)BiS2 shows large increase of Tc up to ~10 K 
by annealing under high-pressure4).  In order to discuss the intrinsic relationship 
between lattice parameter and Tc, high-pressure studies are necessary. 
Synthesis of Bi2(O,F)S2 using XeF2 is the first example for topotactic synthesis of 
electron-doped superconductor via reductive fluorination process, while topotactic 
oxidative fluorination has been used to obtain hole-doped cuprates10), 12)-14).  We think 
that topotactic reductive fluorination can also be a powerful method to explore other novel 
superconductors.  Besides, researches on topotactic fluorination10), 
12)-17) and 
hydrogenation19)20) have been mainly focused on simple and layered perovskite-related 
materials, such as Ruddlesden-Popper type layered perovskite oxides, but our result 
indicate that topotactic reaction can also be applied on layered compounds containing 


6 
 
fluorite-type layer. 
   In summary, a new member of BiS2-based superconductor, Bi2(O,F)S2 with Tc = 5.1 
K was discovered.  Topotactic reductive fluorination using XeF2 in the temperature 
range of 200 ~ 400°C was found to be useful for obtaining Bi2(O,F)S2 as the main phase 
and the reaction at 400°C is suitable for successful control of fluorine content resulting in 
high quality superconductors with sharp transitions and large superconducting volume 
fractions.  Our synthesis of Bi2(O,F)S2 using XeF2 is the first topotactic reductive 
fluorination to obtain an electron-doped superconductor.  Topotactic fluorination could 
be widely used for the control of physical properties in various compounds, including 
layered compounds with complex stacking structure, and this would be helpful for further 
exploration of novel superconductors.
