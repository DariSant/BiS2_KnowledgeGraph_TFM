We investigate the external hydrostatic pressure effect on the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of new layered 
superconductors Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. Though the Tc is found to have moderate decrease from 4.8 K to 4.3 K (dTc
onset/dP = -
0.28 K/GPa) for Bi4O4S3 superconductor, the same increases from 4.6 K to 5 K (dTc
onset/dP = 0.44 K/GPa) upto 1.31 GPa followed by a 
sudden decrease from 5 K to 4.7 K upto 1.75 GPa for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. The variation of Tc in these systems may be 
correlated to increase or decrease of the charge carriers in the density of states under externally applied pressure.  
 
1 Introduction In the past 102 years many 
superconductors have been discovered and categorized into 
low temperature and high temperature superconductors. 
The low temperature superconductors which obey BCS 
theory had been well investigated in the past. In 1986, the 
first high Tc of more than 30 K was found in La2-xBaxCuO4 
by Bednorz and Muller [1]. Soon after, many new 
superconductors were discovered, and the maximum Tc of 
130 K was reported in HgBa2Ca2Cu3Oy at ambient 
pressure. Geo et al. found that on application of external 
pressure (31 GPa), the Tc of HgBa2Ca2Cu3Oy enhanced 
dramatically to 164 K [2]. This study unveiled the 
importance 
of 
high 
pressure 
effect 
on 
high 
Tc 
superconductors [2]. Recently, Kamihara et al., reported 
that doping of F- atom in the place of O2- atom in 
LaFeAsO/F brought superconductivity with Tc ~ 26 K [3]. 
These 
compounds 
are 
called 
Fe 
based 
pnictide 
superconductors [3], having quaternary ZrCuSiAs type 
tetragonal structure at room temperature, consisting of two 
alternating layers of insulating La-O and conducting Fe-
As. 
Later 
new 
members 
of 
Fe 
based 
pnictide 
superconductors were reported with maximum Tc of 56 K 
for SmFeAsO1-xFx [4]. In addition to the chemical pressure 
(La/Sm substitution), application of external pressures also 
played an important and enhanced the Tc of LaFeAsO/F 
from 26 K to 43 K (dTc/d P= 4.25 K/GPa) [5]. Further, a 
maximum record of pressure dependence of Tc (+9.1 
K/GPa) has been reported in FeSe superconductors [6].  
 Hence, it is clear that a small change in the conducting 
layer by use of chemical doping of elements and/or 
externally applied pressure would modify the Tc for the 
layered superconductors. Very recently, superconductivity 
with the Tc of 4.4 K is found in Bi4O4S3 polycrystalline 
compound [7]. It has the 2D tetragonal layered structure 
(space group I4/mmm) with stacking of Bi2S4, Bi2O2 and 
SO4 layers. In this system, superconductivity is found in 
BiS2 layer through the strong hybridization of Bi (6p) and 
S (3p) atoms. These compounds are called BiS2 based 
superconductors. The doping of rare-earth elements (Ce, 
Pr, Yb) in the place of Ln in another BiS2 based 
superconductor LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 leads to increase of Tc from 
1.8 K to 5.3 K, [8,9]. A large shielding fraction of ~100 % 
and maximum onset of Tc ~ 10 K has been reported in 
under high pressure (~2 GPa) synthesized LaBiS2O0.5F0.5 
[10].  Also, a new superconductor based on the rare earth 
blocking layer Nd-O in NdO1-xFx BiS2 (0.1≤ x ≤ 0.6) 
exhibited maximum Tc of 6.7 K [11]. Kotegawa et al., 
reported pressure effect on Tc of Bi4O4S3 superconductor 
and found that Tc gradually decreases for all the applied 
pressures up to 1.92 GPa. However, the Tc increases upto ~ 
1GPa followed by decreasing trend upto 4 GPa in 
LaBiS2(O/F) superconductor [12]. Keeping in view, the 
important role played by external pressure in discovery of 
new superconducting materials, we investigate the 
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (300-3.5 
K) measurements under various hydrostatic pressures for 
both Bi4O4S3 (1.46 GPa) and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (1.75 GPa) 
superconducting polycrystalline samples to understand the 
mechanism of superconducting transition temperature.   
 
2 Experiment The polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 and 
NdBiS2O0.5F0.5 were synthesized by two step solid state 
reaction method. The detailed investigation of synthesis 
and structural analysis were already described elsewhere 
[13,14]. The temperature dependence of electrical 
resistivity (ρ) at ambient and under various hydrostatic 
pressures is measured using four probe technique up to ~2 
GPa using Closed Cycle Refrigerator – Variable 
Temperature Insert (CCR- VTI) system (REF-1810) in the 
temperature ranges of 300 to 3.5 K. A self-clamp type 
hybrid double cylinder (non-magnetic Ni-Cr-Al inner 
cylinder; Be-Cu outer cylinder) pressure cell was used to 
generate hydrostatic pressure up to 3.5 GPa. Daphne 7373 
oil was used as a pressure transmitting medium. The 
applied pressure in the cell was estimated by the structural 
change of bismuth at room temperature.  
 
3 Results and discussion Figs. 1(a & b) show the 
temperature 
dependence 
(300-3.5 
K) 
of 
electrical 
resistivity 
(ρ) 
for 
superconducting 
Bi4O4S3 
and 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples measured at ambient pressure. It is 
found that ρ of both the compounds gradually decreases 
when the temperature reduces to 5 K, followed by sudden 
drop at Tc onset of 4.8 K and 4.6 K corresponding to 


 
 
 
 
Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5 BiS2 superconductor respectively. 
The observation of Tc
onset, Tc
mid and Tc
offset is indicated by 
arrows in the respective figures. The Tc
onset is determined 
from the intersection of the two extrapolated lines, Tc
mid is 
determined from the 50% of the drop in resistivity and 
Tc
offset is determined as the resistivity reaches zero as 
shown in fig. 1(a & b). 
The 
ρ vs T of Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconducting samples at various hydrostatic pressures 
are displayed in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. It is 
clearly noted that the Tc of Bi4O4S3 decreases from 4.8 K to 
4.3 K under applied pressure of upto 1.46 GPa. The insets 
of Figs. 2 (a & b) show ρ(T) in the Tc region (3.5 K to 6 K) 
on the corresponding samples to see the variation of Tc 
under pressure clearly. Figs. 3(a& b) show Tc vs P (phase 
diagram) of Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors 
respectively. The negative pressure coefficient of – 0.287 
K/GPa is observed in Bi4O4S3, which is comparatively 
lower than the value (-1.1 K/GPa) reported by Kotegawa et 
al., for the same compound. Such discrepancy between 
these 
two results 
might be 
connected 
with the 
inhomogeneity of pressure transmitting medium in the 
intender cell and piston cylinder cell. The data obtained 
from the piston cylinder setup is more reliable than the 
intender cell [12]. Under external pressure of 1.31 GPa, the 
Tc
onset of NdO0.5F0.5 BiS2 enhanced gradually from 4.6 K to 
5 K, revealing a positive pressure coefficient of 0.4351 
K/GPa. For Further higher pressures, the Tc
onset decreased 
from 5 K to 4.7 K (dTc
onset/dP= -0.1714 K/GPa) as the 
pressure increased from 1.31 GPa to 1.75 GPa, as shown in 
Fig. 3(b). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 Temperature dependent electrical resistivity of (a) 
Bi4O4S3 and (b) NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 at ambient pressure. The 
methodology of Tc marking is also indicated in the same figures. 
 
Hence it is clear that pressure dependence of Tc and 
pressure coefficient in Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconductors display different trends. The present 
investigation of the pressure dependence of Tc in 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor resembles to pressure 
dependence 
of 
FeAs 
based 
1111 
type 
pnictide 
superconductors [13]. In our case, the polycrystalline 
Bi4O4S3 compound shows the reduction of Tc for all the 
applied pressures (0 to 1.46 GPa) and it may be due to 
existence of  impurity phases (Bi, Bi2S3), which has been 
reported previously [14, 15]. Kotegawa et al. suggested 
that the Tc of these new superconductors (Bi4O4S3 and 
LaBiS2O0.5F0.5) have been located between boundary of 
semiconducting/metallic region and it could be modified 
with respect to externally applied pressure.

Bi4O4S3 and (b) NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. Insets of both figures denoted an 
enlarged view of Tc variation in the low temperature region under 
various pressures. 
 
The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity 
shows 
semiconducting 
nature 
before 
it 
becomes 
superconductor at ambient pressure, and slowly changed 
into metallic nature at a pressure of ~3.4 GPa. Further, 
pressure dependence of Tc shows increasing trend upto 
1.16 Gpa followed by decreasing trend for further increase 
of pressure upto ~4 GPa. Summarily, our results on 
temperature dependence of resistivity at various pressures 
and pressure dependence of Tc show a similar trend upto 
1.75 GPa, and consistence with the results reported by 
Kotegawa et al.       
At high pressure region above 1.31 GPa both 
compounds found to display similar effect on Tc under 
pressure, 
see 
Figs. 
3(a)&(b).

superconductor with positive pressure coefficient 
denotes an increase of density of charge carriers at the 
Fermi surface, whereas negative pressure coefficient 
on Tc meant a reduction of charge carriers at density of 
states (DOS) [16]. At high pressure of 1.75 GPa the 
magnitude of the normal state resistivity increases and 
maintains the semiconducting nature before it becomes 
superconductivity in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor, 
see Fig. 2(b). This may be accounted for an unstable 
Fermi surface with respect to rate of change of carrier 
concentration between conducting (BiS2) and 
insulating (NdO/F) layers under pressure.

To be honest, we are unable to judge the exact reasons 
for the pressure dependence of Tc and mechanism of 
superconductivity in BiS2 based novel superconductors 
from our transport measurements under pressure. The 
origin of such intellectual arguments arises due to less 
number of high pressure measurements and review on BiS2 
based superconducting materials. Though, to the best of 
our knowledge, some other possible reasons may be 
responsible for the reduction of Tc at high pressure: 1) a 
structural distortions 2) collapsed volume phase [17], 3) a 
strong hybridization of rare earth metal Nd3+ (4f) and post 
transition metal Bi3+(6P) with localized electrons resulting 
in a scattering of magnetic impurities 4) induced Kondo 
effect at low temperature [18]. The detailed theoretical 
work on DOS at high pressure and structural analysis by 
high pressure X-ray diffraction and neutron diffraction 
could be useful for better understanding of the change of Tc 
at high pressure, and mechanism of Tc of these 
superconducting materials.  
In summary, we have carried out the temperature 
dependence 
high 
pressure 
electrical 
resistivity 
measurements up to ~1.8 GPa for BiS2 based Bi4O4S3 and 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 novel layered superconductors. Also, we 
have investigated the variation of Tc at different applied 
pressures using four probe techniques. The Tc
onset decreases 
gradually from 4.8 K to 4.3 K in Bi4O4S3 for all the applied 
pressures (0 to 1.4 GPa) and therefore it holds a negative 
pressure coefficient of -0.287 K/GPa. Contrarily, the 
pressure effect on Tc of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 has positive 
pressure coefficient where the Tc
onset increases up to 1.31 
GPa at a rate of 0.435 K/GPa and thereafter it reduces for 
further enhancement of pressure becomes negative 
coefficient (dTc
onset/dP= -0.1714 K/GPa    K/GPa) on Tc at 
high pressure of 1.75 GPa. The present results of 
hydrostatic pressure studies on electrical resistivity of these 
two BiS2 based superconductors from  vs T studies 
suggest that the change of Tc and superconducting state 
under pressure obtained for both compounds are to quite 
different from each other. Further theoretical and other 
experimental studies are required to understand the BiS2 
based series of superconducting materials.
