Abstract 
Structural and physical properties of layered chalcogenide superconductors are 
summarized. In particular, we review the remarkable properties of the Fe-chalcogenide 
superconductors, FeSe and FeTe-based materials. Furthermore, we introduce the 
recently-discovered new BiS2-based layered superconductors and discuss its prospects.

1. Introduction to layered chalcogenide superconductors 
Layered materials have provided us with many interesting fields in physics and 
chemistry. Owing to their two-dimensional crystal structure and electronic states, 
anomalous electronic and magnetic properties have often been observed. In particular, 
exotic superconductivity is likely to prefer such a layered crystal structure. For example, 
superconductivity at a high transition temperature (Tc) has been achieved in layered 
materials, such as cuprates [1-4], Fe-based [5-13], and MgB2 [14,15] superconductors. 
With the respect to this fact, we expect that a new high-Tc superconducting family will 
be found in novel layered materials. 
Among the layered superconductors, the “chalcogenides” are one of the notable 
groups, because of the variety of materials and the observation of exotic 
superconductivity. Sulfur (S), selenium (Se) and tellurium (Te) are categorized as 
chalcogens. Here we introduce the structural and physical properties of some layered 
chalcogenide superconductors. CdI2-type TiSe2 has a simple layered structure composed 
of a stacking of TiSe2 layers as depicted in Fig. 1(a), and exhibits a charge-density-wave 
(CDW) state. When transition metals are intercalated into the interlayer sites or external 
pressures are applied, the CDW state is suppressed and superconductivity is induced 
[16,17]. A topological insulator Bi2Se3 also possesses a layered structure with a 


3 
 
Van-der-Waals gap as displayed in Fig. 1(b). As the same in the case of TiSe2, Bi2Se3 
becomes superconducting by Cu intercalations in the interlayer sites [18,19]. One of the 
notable characteristics of chalcogenides is crystallization of a simple layered structure 
with Van-der-Waals gaps. In such a structure, ions can be easily intercalated to the 
interlayer sites and dramatically change the physical properties of the chalcogenide 
layers. 
The most remarkable layered chalcogenides are the Fe chalcogenides, FeSe and 
FeTe, which are the simplest Fe-based superconductors. The crystal structure of FeSe is 
shown in Fig. 1(c). FeSe exhibits a superconducting transition around 10 K, and shows 
a dramatic increase of Tc up to 37 K under high pressure. In contrast to FeSe, FeTe 
undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition at 70 K. However, a partial substitution of Te 
by S or Se suppresses the antiferromagnetic ordering and induces superconductivity. 
This family is very interesting because the physical properties dramatically change with 
changing local crystal structure upon the co-valent substitutions of S, Se and Te. 
Recently, 
superconductivity 
above 
40 
K 
was 
observed 
in 
metal- 
or 
molecule-intercalated FeSe. To that respect, studies on not only fundamental physics but 
also applications using Fe-chalcogenide superconductors will be actively addressed. In 
the second section, we summarize the physical and structural properties of the 


4 
 
Fe-chalcogenide superconductors. 
Very recently, we discovered a new superconducting family of the layered 
bismuth sulfides [20-22]. In this family, the BiS2 layers are the common 
superconducting structure essential for superconductivity as the CuO2 planes in the 
cuprates and the Fe2An2 (An: Anions of P, As, S, Se or Te) layers in the Fe-based family. 
In the third section, we introduce the discovery of the novel BiS2-based layered 
superconducting family and the latest results. 
 
2. Fe chalcogenides 
In 2008, Kamihara et al. reported superconductivity in Fe-based compound 
LaFeAsO1-xFx [5]. Although the parent compound LaFeAsO is an antiferromagnetic 
metal, 
the 
F 
substitution 
suppresses 
the 
magnetic 
ordering 
and 
induces 
superconductivity with a Tc as high as 26 K. As shown in Fig. 2(a), LaFeAsO has a 
layered structure with a stacking of the blocking La2O2 layers and the superconducting 
Fe2As2 layers. Many FeAs-based compounds analogous to LaFeAsO, for example 
SmFeAsO1-xFx and Ba1-xKxFe2As2, were found to be superconducting with a maximum 
Tc as high as 55 K [7,8]. All the Fe-based superconductors share a common layered 
structure based on the planar layer of an Fe square lattice. In Fe-pnictide 


5 
 
superconductors, blocking layers with alkali, alkali-earth or rare-earth and 
oxygen/fluorine are alternatively stacked with Fe-As conduction layers [5-9, 23-26]. 
Superconductivity in layered Fe chalcogenides was initially found in FeSe by 
Hsu et al. soon after the discovery of superconductivity in the LaFeAsO system [10]. 
Contrary to the FeAs-based superconductors, FeSe is composed of only 
superconducting Fe2Se2 layers as shown in Fig. 2(b). The absence of a blocking layer 
leads Fe-chalcogenides to be the simplest crystal structure among the Fe-based 
superconductors. Furthermore, Fe1+dTe, which possesses a crystal structure analogous to 
FeSe as depicted in Fig. 2(c), exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering as observed in the 
parent (non-doped) phases of FeAs-based superconductors. Thus, the Fe-chalcogenides 
are the key materials for elucidating the mechanism of Fe-based superconductivity 
[10-12].  
 
2-1. FeSe 
PbO-type FeSe is well known as a commercial material, but the discovery of 
superconductivity in this compound was triggered by Fe-based superconductors 
reported in 2008 [10]. PbO-type FeSe is composed of only Fe2Se2 layers with a 
tetragonal structure (space group: P4/nmm). It has an iron-square planar sublattice 


6 
 
equivalent to that of the iron pnictides and its crystal structure is the simplest among the 
Fe-based superconductors. The PbO structure is one of the stable phases of the Fe-Se 
binary compounds [27]. One can therefore obtain a polycrystalline sample of PbO-type 
FeSe using a conventional solid state reaction method. However, FeSe synthesized by 
the solid-state reaction at high temperatures partially contains the NiAs-type 
(hexagonal) FeSe phase. To obtain a single phase of tetragonal FeSe, low temperature 
annealing around 300-400˚C, which transforms the hexagonal to the tetragonal phase, is 
required [28]. FeSe exhibits a structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic 
phase (Cmma) at 70-90 K. This structural transition is not accompanied by any 
magnetic transition and superconductivity occurs in the orthorhombic phase below ~ 12 
K [10, 28-31]. Figure 3 displays the temperature dependence of resistivity and the insets 
show the resistivity under the magnetic fields and the estimated upper critical field 
(µ0Hc2) [10]. The resistivity became zero below 8K, and the high µ0Hc2, the common 
features of Fe-based superconductivity, were observed. Although the Tc of FeSe at 
ambient pressure is relatively low as compared to the other Fe-based superconductors, 
FeSe shows a dramatic enhancement of Tc under high pressures [32-35].  
Fig. 4(a) and (b) show the temperature dependence of resistivity for FeSe under 
high pressure measured using a piston cylinder cell and an indenter cell, respectively 


7 
 
[32, 34]. The pressure dependence of Tc of FeSe shows an anomalous behavior. With 
increasing pressure, the pressure dependence of Tc shows an anomaly around 2 GPa, 
and then exhibits a steep increase above 2 GPa. Above 4 GPa, Tc
onset reaches a 
maximum value of 37K. The fact that the application of pressure dramatically enhances 
Tc in FeSe indicates that the increase of Tc should be related to the change in the local 
crystal structure, because the carrier density does not change largely with applied 
pressure. In fact, the dramatic enhancement of Tc is successfully explained by 
investigating the structural parameter of “anion height” in the Fe layer [33,36,37].  
As shown in Fig. 5, the pressure dependences of Tc and the anion height for 
FeSe show an obvious correlation. This implies that Tc of FeSe can be optimized by 
tuning the anion height. Interestingly, the anion height dependence of Tc is applicable to 
all the Fe-based superconductors, not only for FeSe [36-38]. Fig. 6(a) is the anion height 
dependence of Tc of the typical Fe-based superconductors [36]. A schematic image of 
anion height from the Fe layer is described in Fig. 6(b). The anion height dependence of 
Tc shows a symmetric curve with a peak around 1.38 Å, as indicated by the hand-fitting 
curve. For FeSe, although the data point at ambient pressure does not agree with the 
unique curve, it corresponds above 2 GPa at which the anomaly was observed in the 
pressure dependence of Tc as shown in Fig. 5. It indicates that intrinsic 


8 
 
superconductivity in FeSe might be induced by the application of pressure above 2 GPa. 
 
2-2. High-Tc superconductivity in FeSe-related materials  
As achieved by the application of the external pressure, the Tc of FeSe can be 
enhanced by decreasing the anion height upon metal or molecule intercalations into the 
interlayer sites. Guo et al. reported that K-intercalated FeSe, K0.8Fe2Se2 showed 
superconductivity with a Tc above 30 K [13]. Interestingly, not only metal ions but also 
molecules such as Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1–y can be intercalated into the interlayer site of FeSe; 
Lix(NH2)y(NH3)1–yFe2Se2 shows high Tc above 40 K [39]. To date, many FeSe-based 
superconductors with Tc above 30 K have been reported [13, 39-46]. These facts 
indicate that the mechanisms of high-Tc superconductivity in Fe-based compounds are 
essentially common in FeAs-based and Fe-chalcogenide-based superconductors. 
 
2-3. FeTe 
The crystal structure of FeTe is very analogous to that of FeSe. However, FeTe 
exhibits a magnetic/structural transition at 70 K. In fact, the physical properties of FeTe 
is quite different from those of FeSe [47,48]. FeTe is not superconducting except in the 
special case of the tensile-stressed FeTe thin film [49], which showed superconductivity 


9 
 
at 13 K. Neutron-scattering studies indicate that the spin structure of FeTe is different 
from that of the Fe-pnictide parent compounds as shown Fig. 7 [47]. For FeSe and 
Fe-pnictide superconductors, the antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations with a wave vector 
Qs = (0.5, 0.5) was found to correlates with superconductivity [50-54]. On the other 
hand, FeTe shows magnetic wave vector Qd = (0.5, 0) [50,51]. Several reports indicated 
that the wave vector Qd is not favorable for superconductivity [55-57]. The emergence 
of a Fermi surface nesting associated with Qd could be induced by excess Fe at the 
interlayer site as described in Fig. 2(c). Excess Fe supplies a substantial amount of 
electrons and it has a magnetic moment. FeTe contains 7 – 25 % of excess Fe in its 
crystal structure, and thus the physical properties of FeTe depend on the content of 
excess Fe [55, 57].  
 
2-4. FeTe-based superconductors 
2-4-1. FeTe1-xSex 
As mentioned above, FeTe exhibits an antiferromagnetic ordering associated 
with a lattice distortion at 70 K. Furthermore, FeTe possesses excess Fe (7 ~ 25 %) at 
the interlayer sites. However, partial Se substitutions suppress the low temperature 
structural/magnetic phase transition, and thereby produce superconductivity [11, 58, 59]. 


10 
 
The effect of Se substitution other than the suppression of magnetic ordering is a 
reduction of excess Fe concentration. Due to both effects, bulk superconducting state 
can be realized. Fig. 8 shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for 
FeTe1-xSex (a) around TN, (b) around Tc. The long-range magnetic ordering was 
suppressed with increasing Se concentration and completely disappeared at x = 0.15. 
The Tc is also gradually enhanced with increasing Se content and the optimal 
superconducting properties are obtained at a composition of FeTe0.5Se0.5 with Tc of 14 K, 
which is the highest Tc at ambient pressure among the FeTe-based superconductors. 
Furthermore FeTe1-xSex shows a positive pressure effect on Tc as in the case of FeSe 
[60,61]. As depict in Fig. 9, a dome-shaped Tc versus pressure curve arises and 
maximum Tc of 23 K appears at 2 GPa [60].  
 
2-4-2. FeTe1-xSx 
As the partial Se substitution for Te induces superconductivity in FeTe, the S 
substitution for Te also suppresses the magnetism and induces superconductivity [12]. 
However, in the case of FeTe1-xSx, the optimal substitution cannot be achieved due to the 
low S/Te solubility limit as shown in Fig. 10 [62]. Although the antiferromagnetic 
ordering can be completely suppressed by the 20 % of S substitution, bulk 


11 
 
superconductivity is not observed; only weak superconductivity is observed. This can be 
understood that the appearance of bulk superconductivity in FeTe1-xSx is influenced by 
the higher content of excess Fe resulting from low S concentration. In particular, the 
FeTe0.8S0.2 samples synthesized using a solid state reaction method show a broad 
transition in temperature dependence of resistivity, and diamagnetic signal 
corresponding to superconductivity is not observed. In order to enhance the weak 
superconductivity, ingenious attempts have been carried out and exotic annealing effects 
were discovered.  
 
2-5. Annealing effects of FeTe-based superconductors 
Fig. 11(a) displays temperature dependence of resistivity for the FeTe0.8S0.2 
sample kept in the air for several days. Although the as-grown sample does not show 
zero resistivity, the sample which was exposed to the air for several days shows zero 
resistivity with a sharp superconducting transition [63, 64]. After 2 years, the Tc
zero 
reached 7.8 K. The superconducting signal of magnetic susceptibility also dramatically 
enhanced with increasing air-exposure time as shown Fig. 11(b).  
Furthermore it is found that the weak superconductivity could be effectively 
improved by annealing in oxygen [65,66]. Fig. 12 shows the temperature dependence of 


12 
 
magnetic susceptibility for the samples annealed with various annealing condition. Only 
the oxygen-annealed sample shows a large superconducting signal. Y. Kawasaki et al. 
reported that oxygen annealing is applicable to not only FeTe1-xSx but also FeTe1-xSex 
[67]. Fig. 13 shows temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for O2-annealed 
samples with various Se concentrations (a) around TN, (b) around Tc. Only a 10% 
substitution of Te by Se completely suppressed the magnetic ordering and induced bulk 
superconductivity. The difference between as-grown and O2-annealed samples is 
remarkable with the data in Fig. 8. 
The phase diagrams based on the magnetic susceptibility measurement for the 
as-grown and O2-annealed samples are shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b). The as-grown 
samples showed the long-range AFM in the range of x ≤ 0.15 and weak 
superconductivity in 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4 where “weak superconductivity” means non-bulk 
(filamentary or partial) superconducting state interfered by excess Fe. Only the 
FeTe0.5Se0.5 sample was found to be a bulk superconductor. For O2-annealed samples, 
the coexistence of AFM ordering and weak superconductivity was observed only for x 
≤ 0.1. As the long-range AFM ordering was completely suppressed, the O2-annealed 
samples with x ≥ 0.1 became  bulk superconductors. It is clear from the Fig. 14 that 
the bulk superconducting region dramatically spreads via O2-annealing.  


13 
 
Next, we discuss the origin of the appearance of bulk superconductivity on the 
basis of antiferromagnetic fluctuations. As mentioned in section 2.1, Antiferromagnetic 
spin fluctuations with the wave Qs = (0.5, 0.5) were observed in FeSe as well as the 
other FeAs. In contrast, FeTe exhibits antiferromagnetic wave vector Qd = (0.5, 0). 
From the neutron scattering measurements, it is revealed that the Qs and Qd are 
observed over a wide composition range where FeTe1-xSex exhibits weak 
superconductivity [56, 68]. For as-grown FeTe1-xSex samples, weak superconductivity 
was observed in the range of 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.4, suggesting that the nesting vectors Qs and 
Qd coexist. It is expected that the nesting vector Qs becomes dominant for FeTe0.5Se0.5 
where bulk superconductivity sets in. On the other hand, for the O2-annealed samples, 
the bulk superconducting region extends down to x = 0.1, which implies that the nesting 
vector Qd is strongly suppressed by O2-annealing. By investigating the oxygen 
annealing effect, it was concluded that the oxygen ions intercalated between 
superconducting layers play a key role in the suppression of magnetic wave vector Qd 
due to the compensation of the electrons given by the excess Fe ion and the appearance 
of bulk superconductivity. 
 
2-6. Softchemical treatment for deintercalation of excess Fe 


14 
 
It was found that the alcoholic beverages induced superconductivity in 
FeTe0.8S0.2 [69]. In this report, the FeTe0.8S0.2 samples were immersed in red wine, white 
wine, beer, Japanese sake (rice wine), shochu (distilled spirit), and whisky, and then 
heated at 70ºC for 24 h. The obtained shielding volume fractions are summarized in Fig. 
15 as a function of ethanol concentration. The shielding volume fractions of the samples 
heated in water-ethanol mixtures are between 6 and 9 %. In contrast, the shielding 
volume fraction of the samples heated in alcoholic beverages is 21 - 63 %, significantly 
larger than that with the water-ethanol mixtures. In the first report, we concluded that 
alcoholic beverages, particularly red wine, were more effective in inducing 
superconductivity in FeTe0.8S0.2 than water, although the exact mechanism of how they 
acted to enhance the superconductivity in FeTe1-xSx remained unsolved. This unique 
annealing effect was also confirmed by FeTe1-xSex sample. Fig. 16 indicates alcoholic 
annealing effect for FeTe0.9Se0.1. In the case of FeTe0.9Se0.1, the highest volume fraction 
was observed by red wine sample and the smallest value among the alcoholic beverages 
was obtained with shochu. This behavior is similar to the case of FeTe1-xSx.  
Recently, we have successfully clarified that the mechanism of inducement of 
superconductivity in FeTe1-xSx by alcoholic beverages is the deintercalation of excess Fe 
from the interlayer sites [70]. Utilizing a technology of metabolomic analysis, we 


15 
 
performed the investigation of the ingredient in the alcoholic beverage and found that 
the solutions of malic acid, citric acid, and β-alanine also induced the superconductivity 
in FeTe0.8S0.2 as depicted in Fig. 17(a) and (b). Additionally, inductively-coupled plasma 
spectroscopy analysis indicated that Fe ion was deintercalated from the sample to these 
solutions as shown Fig. 17(c). These results suggest that part of the excess Fe was 
deintercalated from the interlayer sites. Therefore, alcoholic beverage annealing 
suppresses the magnetic moment of excess Fe by deintercalating the excess Fe and, 
hence superconductivity is achieved. The similar situations, enhancement of the 
superconductivity by the deintercalation of excess Fe, were reported [71, 72] Thus the 
technique can be generally applied to the layered Fe-chalcogenide superconductors. 
 
3. BiS2-based layered superconductors 
Discovery of a common superconducting layer is very important because many 
analogous superconductors can be designed by changing the spacer layers as have the 
high-Tc cuprates and the Fe-based superconductors. Recently, we found that the BiS2 
layer can be a basic superconducting layer of new class of the layered superconducting 
family. 
The first BiS2-based superconductor is Bi4O4S3 [20]. The determined crystal structure 


16 
 
is shown in Fig. 18(a). The crystal structure is composed of a stacking of rock-salt-type 
BiS2 layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1-x layers (blocks) where x indicates the existence of the 
defects of SO4
2- ions at the interlayer sites. The parent phase (x = 0) is Bi6O8S5, and 
Bi4O4S3 is expected to have about 50 % defects of the SO4
2- site (x = 0.5). In layered 
materials, such defects of the interlayer sites are often observed. 
Temperature dependence of resistivity is displayed in Fig. 19. A gradual 
decrease of resistivity was observed below 8.6 K and the zero-resistivity state was 
observed at 4.5 K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate that Bi4O4S3 was a 
bulk superconductor. To investigate the origin of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3, we 
performed band calculations. The band calculation indicated that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) was 
metallic while the parent phase of Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) was found to be a band insulator with 
Bi3+. For Bi4O4S3, the Fermi level lies within the bands which mainly originate from the 
Bi 6p orbitals as displayed in Fig. 20. In particular, the Fermi level is just on the peak 
position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS2 layer. 
The second BiS2-based system is ReO1-xFxBiS2 (Re = Rare earth). So far, 
superconductivity is observed in LaO1-xFxBiS2 [24], NdO1-xFxBiS2 [25], CeO1-xFxBiS2 
[73] and PrO1-xFxBiS2 [74]. The crystal structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 is show in Fig. 18(b). 
These materials also possess the BiS2 layers as superconducting layers. The structure is 


17 
 
simpler than that of Bi4O4S3; hence, we can consider this system as a prototype of 
BiS2-based superconductors. Temperature dependences of resistivity under magnetic 
fields for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and NdO1-xFxBiS2 are shown in Figs. 21(a) and (b), respectively. 
Super conducting transition occurs at 10.6 and 5.6 K for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and 
NdO1-xFxBiS2. We note that the blocking layer of La2O2 or Nd2O2 is analogous to those 
in FeAs-1111 system such as LaFeAsO. Owing to the analogy of crystal structure 
between the BiS2-based and the Fe-based superconductors, we will easily design new 
BiS2-based superconductors by changing the blocking layers. We strongly expect that 
further enhancements of Tc are achieved by changing the blocking layers in the 
BiS2-based superconductor and the discovery of new BiS2-based materials open a new 
field in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors. In fact, some 
preliminary reports have indicated the possibility of unconventional superconductivity 
in the BiS2-based superconductors [75-78]. 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this review, we introduced the crystal structure and physical properties of 
remarkable layered chalcogenide superconductors. Chalcogenides tend to crystallize in 
a layered structure; hence, the intercalations/deintercalations of ions or molecules at the 


18 
 
interlayer site dramatically changes the physical properties and induces exotic 
superconductivity. The most remarkable family is the Fe chalcogenides, which is the 
simplest Fe-based superconductor. In this series, the key factors to induce 
superconductivity are the suppression of antiferromagnetism of Fe planes and the 
reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe at the interlayer site. The later, reduction of 
magnetic moment of excess Fe can be achieved by oxygen intercalation via annealing in 
oxygen condition or deintercalation of excess Fe via annealing in acid. Interestingly, red 
wine is the most effective than any other solution. At the end, we introduced the newly 
discovered BiS2-based superconducting family. The BiS2 layer is likely to play an 
important role of the superconductivity, as CuO2 plane of cuprates and FeAn (FeAs, FeP, 
FeSe or FeTe) layers of Fe-based superconductors. We will be able to create new 
BiS2-based superconductors with various blocking layers. We believe that unidentified 
exotic chalcogenide superconductors other than the families introduced here exist and 
are waiting to be discovered in near future.
