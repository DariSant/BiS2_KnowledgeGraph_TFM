We report the effect of hydrostatic pressure (0 – 1.97 GPa) on the superconductivity of 
BiS2 based CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. The CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor was synthesized by 
the solid state reaction route and the compound is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group. 
The studied compound shows superconductivity with transition temperature of 2.5K (Tc
onset) at 
ambient pressure, which has been enhanced to 8 K at applied pressure of 1.97 GPa. The observed 
normal resistivity exhibited semiconducting behavior. The data of normal state resistivity ρ(T) 
has been fitted by activation type equation and it is found that the energy gap is significantly 
reduced with pressure. Resistivity measurements under magnetic field for the highest applied 
pressure of 1.97GPa (Tc
onset = 8K) exhibits the upper critical field of above 5Tesla. The 
observation of fourfold increase in Tc accompanied with improved normal state conduction 
under hydrostatic pressure on CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor calls for the attention of solid state 
physics community.

Introduction 
There has been a great interest in the scientific community after the discovery of Bi4O4S3 
superconductor with transition temperature Tc = 8.6K [1,2] and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Ce, Nd 
and Pr) with Tc = 2.5-10K [3-10]. The parent phase, REOBiS2 (RE = La, Nd, Ce and Pr) 
exhibited bad metal behavior [3-10]. In these compounds the superconductivity is induced by the 
electron doping which is carried out via substitution of F-1at O-2 site in the oxide block (REO). At 
the same time in similar structure i.e. SrFBiS2 compound, the superconductivity has been 
observed via hole doping that is attained by the substitution of La3+ at Sr2+ site [11,12]. Therefore 
it can be safely said that superconductivity appears via carrier doping in the vicinity of the 
insulating-like state of the parent BiS2 based compounds. Moreover, the superconductivity has 
also been induced via chemical substitution of the tetravalent ions such as Th4+, Hf4+, Zr4+ and 
Ti4+ in place of trivalent lanthanum La3+, resulting in the increase of charge density in bad metal 
LaOBiS2 compound [13]. In various REO0.5F0.5BiS2 systems, the role played by the rare earth 
elements is noteworthy as for example replacing La with heavier rare earth elements, the Tc 
(2.1K) of  LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 increases to 3.5K and 5K for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[3,4,10].  
Both the experimental and theoretical studies of BiS2 based superconductors have 
progressed well but the studies related to impact of external high pressure on the 
superconducting properties of this compound are limited to select groups only [14-16]. The 
application of external pressure may effectively change the superconducting properties such as 
transition temperature Tc of these BiS2 compounds.  Also the same could effectively alter the 
lattice constants through bond lengths and angles that would certainly affect the electronic and 
magnetic correlations of a superconductor. In fact the REO/FBiS2 samples being prepared under 
high pressure (HP) showed higher Tc [3]. It has been speculated that increase in Tc is due to a 
structural phase transition under pressure. In fact later it was observed by X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) measurements under ~1GPa pressure that a structural phase transition from tetragonal 
phase (P4/nmm) to monoclinic phase (P21/m) takes place in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [17].   
Keeping in view the importance of impact of the external pressure on the 
superconductivity of BiS2 based superconductors we study the effect of hydrostatic pressure on 
the superconductivity of the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound having a Tc of 2.2K at ambient pressure.

This compound is also reported to exhibit the coexistence of superconductivity and 
ferromagnetism either due to the possible local moments of the Ce or may be some unseen exotic 
reasons related to the superconducting mechanism [9,18]. Worth mentioning is the fact that 
impact of hydrostatic pressure on superconductivity of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 has already been reported 
very recently [14,15]. An increase in Tc from 2.2K at ambient pressure to above 6K was 
observed at 1.64GPa, which remains nearly unaltered for studied higher pressures of up to 
2.47GPa [14]. In the present report, the compound CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 has been subjected to pressure 
dependent electrical resistivity in the temperature range 300 K down to 2K at several applied 
pressures of 0 to 1.97GPa to reproduce and test the earlier reported interesting result [14,15]. Our 
results are though qualitatively similar to that as reported earlier [14,15], yet quantitatively 
different. In our case the Tc
onset increases to above 7K at just 0.97GPa. Also the superconducting 
transitions are relatively sharper in our case. We also did the magneto transport measurements 
under high pressure with maximum Tc to estimate the upper critical field (Hc2) and compared the 
same with our reported ambient pressure results [18]. The normal state conduction of our studied 
compound is also seemingly better than the one being reported earlier [14,15]. This may be 
possible due to slight change in quality of the studied samples. In any case, without ambiguity 
the fourfold enhancement in Tc at just 0.97GPa pressure calls for the attention of solid state 
physics community.  
Experimental Details 
We synthesized polycrystalline sample of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 by standard solid state reaction 
route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Ce, Bi, S, CeF3 and CeO2 were weighed in 
stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under pure argon gas atmosphere. The 
mixed powder was subsequently palletized and vacuums sealed (10-3Torr) in a quartz tube. 
Sealed quartz ampoule was placed in tube furnace and heat treated at 7000C for 12hours with the 
typical heating rate of 20C/minute followed by cooling down slowly over a span of six hours to 
ambient temperature and this entire process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was 
performed at ambient temperature in the scattering angular range of 100 – 800 (2 ) in equal step 
of 0.020 using Rigaku Diffractometer with CuKα (λ=1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was carried out 
using the standard FullProf program. For carrying out measurement of pressure dependent 
electrical resistivity, HPC-33 piston type pressure cell compatible to DC resistivity Option of the 


4 
 
Quantum Design’s 14Tesla PPMS was used. The Hydrostatic pressures were generated by a 
BeCu/NiCrAl clamped piston-cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a fluid pressure 
transmitting medium of Fluorinert (FC70:FC77=1:1) in a Teflon cell. Annealed Pt leads were 
affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces of the sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-wire 
configuration. The pressure at low temperature was calibrated from the superconducting 
transition temperature of Pb. 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows the room temperature observed and Reitveld fitted XRD patterns of 
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. The synthesized compound is well fitted in tetragonal structure with 
space group P4/nmm. The Rietveld refined lattice parameters are a = 4.037(2)Å and c = 
13.407(3)Å. In the previous report [9] it has been shown that the c parameter for the parent phase 
CeOBiS2 is 13.604Å, which is larger in comparison of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. The decrease in c 
parameter of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample is a clear indication of O-2 site F-1 doping in parent CeOBiS2 
compound [18]. It is to be mentioned that the studied compound is contaminated with small 
impurity of Bi, which is marked with # in Fig. 1. The small Bi impurity appears close to the main 
peaks of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 tetragonal structure and is reportedly seen in most of CeO1-xFxBiS2 
samples [9].  We choose to work on x = 0.5 composition, because the Tc is near maximum at this 
doping level [9]. Inset of the Fig 1 shows the resultant unit cell of the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample with 
P4/nmm space group.  The layered structure is composed of CeO and BiS2 layer along the c axis. 
Various atoms with their respective positions are indicated in crystal structure. Cerium (Ce), and 
Sulfur (S1and S2) atoms occupy the 2c (0.25, 0.25, z) site. On the other hand O/F atoms are 
located at 2a (0.75, 0.25, 0) site. 
The temperature dependent electrical resistivity with applied pressures from 0GPa-
1.97GPa for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is shown in the Figure 2a. The electrical resistivity data is 
recorded from 300K down to 2K. Without applied pressure the normal state resistivity shows the 
semiconducting behavior down to the onset superconducting transition temperature Tc
onset. With 
an increase in applied pressure the normal state resistivity is though suppressed but yet exhibits 
semiconducting behavior. Figure 2(b) shows the expanded part of the Fig. 2(a) in the temperature 
range from 2K to 15K, to clearly visualize the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 
CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound for the various applied pressures. At zero pressure Tc(ρ = 0) is 2.2K

and which is though nearly unchanged for 0.35GPa pressure, but the same increases slightly to 
2.5K at 0.55GPa pressure. At 0.97GPa pressure the Tc(ρ = 0) increases to above 3.5K with a 
broader transition width.  In fact the Tc
onset increases to above 7K at just 0.97GPa. It seems there 
is a sudden increase in onset of superconductivity at 0.97GPa. Both Tc
onset  and Tc(ρ = 0)  are 
marked in Figure 2b. At further higher pressure of 1.38GPa though the Tc(ρ = 0) is increased 
sharply from 3.5K to 6K, the Tc
onset increases to around 8K only.  For still higher applied 
pressures of 1.68 and 1.97GPa the Tc(ρ = 0) is seen at 7K with 8K onset Tc. To clearly visualize 
the pattern of increase in Tc
onset and Tc(ρ = 0), in  Figure 2c we plot both the quantities against 
applied pressure for the studied CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. Seemingly though there is a sharp 
increase in both at 0.97GPa, but the Tc
onset is enhanced relatively more. This gives rise to an 
increased broadening of transition at 0.97GPa, which is plotted in inset of Figure 2(c). The 
measurements are performed with increasing the pressure. Summarily it can be seen that the 
Tc
onset initially increases up to 7K till 0.97GPa pressure and later saturates for the higher 
pressures of 1.97GPa. On the other hand, the normal state resistivity keep on decreasing with 
applied pressures up to 1.97GPa. The sharp increase in superconducting transition temperature 
under hydrostatic pressure of just around 1GPa may happen due to structural phase 
transformation being evident recently in these systems [17,19]. Also, there is a possibility of the 
presence of strong electron correlations in BiS2 superconducting layers being enhanced under 
pressure.   
To explore quantitatively the trend of change in normal state conduction with pressure, in 
Figure 3(a), we show the of log(ρ) vs 1/T plots for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound at various applied 
pressures. This is done to determine the values of energy gaps in semi-metallic regime. The 
observed data of the resistivity could be described in two different regions by the activation type 
relation ρ(T) = ρ0eΔ/2kBT where ρ0 is a constant, Δ is the energy gap and kB is the Boltzmann 
constant. The observed resistivity versus temperature data could not be fitted for a single gap in 
entire temperature range. Hence the fitting has been done in two distinct regions of ρ(T). Thus 
obtained energy gaps are marked as Δ1 in the temperature range 300 to 200K and Δ2 from 20K 
down to Tc onset. The semiconducting behavior is suppressed with pressure in a similar fashion 
as observed earlier for another BiS2 based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [14, 15]. The analysis 
of ρ(T) data at the ambient pressure gives the estimated values of the energy gaps Δ1/kB ≈

2024.55 K and Δ2/kB ≈ 65.68 K for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. Interestingly, the obtained 
values are considerably less than the ones reported by Wolowiec et al. for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 
compound [15]. May be the presently studied CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound possesses improved 
normal state conduction than the one reported in ref. 15. Figure 3(b) shows the variation of 
calculated energy gaps (Δ1/kB, Δ2/kB) with various applied pressures from 0-1.97GPa.  It can be 
clearly seen from Fig. 3(b) that both energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 decrease rapidly with applied 
pressure of up to 1.68GPa and are almost saturated for 1.97GPa pressure. The decrease of energy 
gaps with increasing pressure, suggests the increase of charge carriers density at the Fermi 
surface with application of pressure. Interestingly, the first-principle calculations have suggested 
that there could be a insulator-metal transition accompanied with superconductivity at low 
temperature under pressure in these systems [20]. In the present study, we observed that up to 
1.97GPa pressure though there is no insulator to metal transition, but the semiconducting 
behavior is suppressed significantly and superconductivity onset transition temperature is 
increased from around 2.5K to 8K. The interesting BiS2 based CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor 
need to be studied for further higher pressures.    
Figure 4 represents the temperature dependent resistivity under applied magnetic field up 
to 5Tesla for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample at 1.97GPa pressure. The broadening in the superconducting 
transition Tc with increasing applied field shows the typical type II superconductivity behavior 
for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. With applied magnetic fields both Tc
onset and Tc(ρ = 0) 
decrease to lower temperatures with an increase in broadening of the transition. The trend is 
similar to that as for high Tc layered cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors. The upper critical 
field (Hc2) of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample at ambient and 1.97GPa hydrostatic pressure has been 
shown in the Figure 4b.  The Hc2 is calculated from 90% criteria of normal state resistivity (ρn) 
by using the conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation, i.e., 
Hc2(0) = −0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc. The estimated values of Hc2(0) are 1.5 Tesla for 0 pressure and 
4.8 Tesla for 1.97GPa pressure.  The Hc2 data points at ambient pressure have been taken from 
our earlier report on CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [18].

Conclusion 
 
The phase pure tetragonal CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor with Tc=2.2 K has been 
synthesized using solid state reaction route and studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure on its 
normal state and superconducting properties. The superconducting transition temperature of the 
synthesized compound is enhanced fourfold from around 2 K to 8 K at 1.97 GPa. The electrical 
resistivity data in the entire temperature range has been fitted using activation type equation 
revealing significant improvement in electrical conduction under pressure. The estimated value 
of the upper critical field for this compound at 1.97 GPa is above 5 Tesla. The observation of 
fourfold increase in Tc accompanied with improved normal state conduction under just above 
1GPa hydrostatic pressure on CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor calls for the attention of solid state 
physics community.
