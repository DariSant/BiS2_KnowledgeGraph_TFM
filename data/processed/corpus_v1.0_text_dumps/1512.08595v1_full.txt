Abstract: 
We report impact of hydrostatic pressure on the newly discovered BiS2 based 
superconductors. In last couple of years the new BiS2 based superconductor attracted great 
attention of the condensed matter physics community. These new layered BiS2-based compounds 
are very sensitive to the concentration of carriers doping and pressure that cause profound 
changes in their physical properties with appearance of superconductivity in the vicinity of their 
insulating/semiconducting state. The BiS2-based new compounds are expected to provide us with 
the next stage of exploring new superconductors and to discuss their exotic superconductivity 
mechanisms. In current review, we present most of our findings related to impact of hydrostatic 
pressure on superconductivity of new BiS2 based superconductors at one place.

1.Introduction 
Superconductivity was first found in the Bi4O4S3 compound with the Tc value of 4.5K in 
the year 2012 by Y. Mizuguchi et.al [1]. Within a week or so, S. K. Singh et al. reproduced the 
superconductivity and confirmed the bulk characteristics of the emerging superconductivity from 
transport and magnetic measurements [2]. Structurally, thecompound is the layered one [1-6]. In 
the same year, other BiS2 based superconductors have been discovered like LaO1−xFxBiS2, CeO1−
xFxBiS2, PrO1−xFxBiS2 and NdO1−xFxBiS2 with Tc of 3.0, 2.5, 3.5 and 5.6K respectively [7-17]. 
These compounds are similar to the Cuprates [18] and Fe-based superconductors [19] in layered 
crystal structure and some exotic physical properties. As a matter of fact, the parent phase of 
these compounds, i.e., CeOBiS2has been synthesized earlier in 1976 itself [20]. Later in 1997, 
some other similar compounds viz. REOBiS2 (RE=La, Pr, Nd and Yb) were synthesized, and 
found to exhibit semiconducting behavior [21]. Superconductivity in these compounds was 
observed by electron doping via F1- substitution at the s O2- site [7-17].  The superconductivity in 
BiS2 based compounds has also been observed via substitution of tetravalent Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4, 
and Ti+4 for trivalent La+3 in LaOBiS2 [22]. Superconductivity was also reported in SrFBiS2 
compound, via electron doping by substitution of La3+ at the site of Sr2+ [23,24]. The SrFBiS2 
seems to be the parent compound of the 1112 family [24]. The newest layered BiS2-based 
superconducting systems appear to be very sensitive to the carrier doping level, as the atomic 
substitutions cause profound changes in their properties [25-33]. The BiS2-based compounds are 
expected to provide us with the next stage to explore new superconductors and discuss the exotic 
superconductivity mechanisms. The electronic structure of Bi4O4S3has been discussed from 
theoretical band calculations for both the parent and superconducting phases [1]. The electronic 
structure of BiS2 based superconducting materials has been proposed by several groups by using 
theoretical calculations like density functional theory [38-56]. X. Wan et. al., compared the 
experimental and theoretical results, and found that changing the interlayer distances only 
slightly affects the band structure [41]. For LaOBiS2, both S3p and O2p states appear mainly 
between −4.0 and 0.0 eV. Although it is located primarily above the Fermi level, Bi 6p also 
makes a considerable contribution to the states between −4.0 and 0.0 eV, indicating a strong 
hybridization between Bi-6p and S-3p states [56]. The crystal structure of LaO/FBiS2 is 
composed of a stacking of LaO/F layers and double BiS2 layers. In terms of electronic bands, the 
parent compound LaOBiS2 is consisting of valence band O and S p states and a conduction band 


3 
 
of Bi-6p and S-3p states, which is a band insulator with an energy gap of 0.4 eV [38,41].S. 
Nagira et al. obtained core level spectrum and showed the appearance of a new spectral 
component on the lower binding energy side of Bi 4f, which may be explained by core hole 
screening with metallic states near EF. The electronic structure information on the new 
superconductor by Valence band SXPES measurements including the shape of the valence band, 
x-dependent energy shift, and appearance of states at EF with the Bi 6p character, which show 
overall agreement with band structure calculations. [57]. L. K. Zeng et al. ARPES results show 
the anomalous temperature dependence of the low-energy spectrum indicates that the electrons 
could be strongly coupled with the lattice in the low-temperature normal state of this 
superconductor. [58]. While Z. R. Ye et al. and X. B. Wang et al. found small Fermi pocket size 
and the weak electron correlations and suggest that the BiS2-based superconductors could be 
conventional BCS superconductors mediated by electron phonon coupling [59,60].T. Machida et 
al. report the origin of the superconductivity in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 system by STM and STS 
experiments, and say that the electronic spatial structures coexist with the bulk superconductivity 
[61]. S. F. Wu et al. performed polarized Raman scattering measurements on the newly 
discovered superconductor Nd(O,F)BiS2 and suggest that the BiS2-based superconductors are 
possibly phonon-mediated BCS superconductors [62]. H.-F. Zhai et al. report another phase 
EuFBiS2 and Eu3Bi2S4F4 of BiS2 based superconducting compounds [63, 64]. 
The role of rare earth elements is also crucial in superconductivity of BiS2 based 
compounds as in the Fe based and High Tc cuprate superconductors. Some experimental studies 
show that superconductivity effectively increases as light rare earth element replaced by heavier 
rare earth element [7-18]. Interestingly, chemical substitutions play an important role to induce 
superconductivity in the BiS2 based compounds. The external pressure dependent studies have 
also been done effectively on these compounds, which modified the superconductivity of BiS2 
based superconductors [65-80]. Due to the applied pressure the change in lattice parameters 
through bond lengths and angles took place, which positively affected the electronic and 
magnetic correlations of the superconductor [81].In addition, the structural phase transition from 
tetragonal to monoclinic has been explained on the basis of analysis of the x-ray diffraction 
patterns under high pressure of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound and perfect tetragonal phase has 
been reported for the high pressure synthesized of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 compound [69,70].

2. Effect of hydrostatic pressure 
2.1REO1-xFxBiS2(RE=La, Ce, Pr and Nd) 
 
The first pressure study on for Bi4O4S3compound was investigated by Kotegawa et al. up to 
applied pressures 1.92 GPa [65].The Tc gradually decreases without a distinct change in the 
metallic behavior in the normal state resistivity [65].The same has been reported by Kalai et al. 
[66].Superconductivity above the 10K for high pressure synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2has been 
reported under hydrostatic pressure by Kotegawa et al. [65] and further the evolution of Tc under 
applied pressure for LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples were reported by Wolowiec et al. [66–71]. 
 
 
Now after well establishing the superconducting properties REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Ce, 
Pr and Nd) superconductors [7-17,100], we study the impact of hydrostatic pressure on their 
superconductivity. In our previous studies the temperature dependent electrical resistivity from 
300K down to 2K at various applied pressures for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound see figure 1. At 
ambient pressure normal state resistivity ρ(T) exhibits semiconducting behavior for all the 
compounds, which is strongly suppressed with increasing pressure from 0-0.97GPa and then 
suppressed systematically before being practically unchanged for the higher applied pressures of 
above 1GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2compoundssee figure 1(a, b). While the normal 
state electrical resistivity increases for higher applied pressure above the 0.55GPa for 
thePrO0.5F0.5BiS2and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2compounds see figure 1(c, d).  Figure 2(a-d) is the clearly 
visualize the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds for the 
various applied pressures. The superconducting temperature Tc for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be seen 
from the Figure 2aTc(ρ=0) is 2K at 0GPa pressure, which slightly increases to 2.5K at applied 
pressure of 0.35GPa. Interestingly for 0.55GPa applied pressure, the superconducting transition 
temperature Tc(ρ=0) increases to 5K with Tc
onset at 9.8K and the transition broadening [Tc
onset
- 
Tc(ρ=0)] is significantly high. For the applied pressure of 0.97GPa the Tc(ρ=0) is increased to 
9.8K with Tc
onset at around 10.5K, having a relatively sharp transition. The estimated pressure 
coefficient dTc(onset)/dP of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is +8K/GPa. Increase in the Tc with applied pressure 
for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2is shown in figure 2b. It is clear from figure 2b, at zero pressure Tc(ρ=0) is 
2.2K and which is unchanged for 0.35GPa pressure, but the same increases slightly to 2.5K at 
0.55GPa pressure. At 0.97GPa pressure the Tc(ρ=0) increases to above 3.5K with a slightly 
broader transition width. At further higher pressure of 1.38GPa the Tc(ρ=0) is increased to 6K. 


5 
 
For still higher applied pressures of 1.68 and 1.97GPa the Tc(ρ=0) is seen at 7K with 8K onset 
Tc. The pressure coefficient dTc(onset)/dP of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 is estimated to be near 6K/GPa.

Figure 2: (a-d) ρVs T plots for REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Ce, Pr and Nd) compounds, at various 
applied pressures in the Tc range. 
It is clearly seen from the figure 2c with applied pressures the superconductivity 
increases from 3.5K to up to 7.8K. The superconducting temperature Tc slightly increases 3.5K 
to 4K for the applied pressure from 0 to 0.97GPa. For 1.38GPa pressure the Tc
onset increases to 
above 6K with the broadening of transition. For further higher pressures of 1.68 and 1.97GPa, 
the Tc
onset increases up to 7.8K with sharp superconducting transitions. The estimated dTc
onset/dP 
of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is around 2.5K/GPa for the obtained highest Tc
onset of 7.8K for the applied 
pressure 1.68GPa.   Figure 2d shows the Tc=4.3K at 0GPa pressure and slightly increases up to 
Tc=4.8K for the applied pressure 0.35-0.55GPa. At the applied pressure 0.97GPa the 
superconducting transition temperature Tc(ρ=0) increases to 5K with Tc
onset=6K and the 
transition broadening is significantly high. For the applied pressure of 1.38GPa the 
superconducting transition temperature is nearly the same but the normal state resistivity 
behavior changed. For the further higher applied pressure 1.38GPa the Tc of the sample is 
changed as Tc
onset=7.5K, for the 1.68GPa pressure the Tc
onset is unchanged at pressure 1.97GPa

but the resistivity at low temperature is increases at this pressure. The pressure coefficient 
dTc(onset)/dP =1.90K/GPa of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 is comparably lower from the above studied both 
compounds. 
The Pressure dependent superconducting transition temperature Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) for the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, CeO0.5F0.5BiS2,PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds has been shown in 
the Figure 3(a, b). For the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2compound the Tconset is enhanced sharply at the 
pressure 0.55GPa, while Tc(ρ=0) increases up to 5K. It may be due to the mixed state of lower 
and high Tc phase of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. At the applied pressure 0.97GPa both the 
Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) shifts to the 10K and 9.8K respectively, which is the transition pressure (Pt) of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2compound. For the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2compound at 0.97GPa pressure the Tc
onset 
increases up to the 7K and the Tc(ρ=0) increases to above 3.5K.For the further higher 
pressureof1.38GPathoughthe the Tc
onset increases to around 8K only and Tc(ρ=0) isincreased 
sharply from3.5Kto6K. For the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2compoundsthe Pt is at 
1.68GPa. For the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample the superconductivity initially increase up to 10K at the 
0.97GPa and then it’s saturate for the further higher pressures of 1.38GPa and 1.68GPa. In our 
results we did not observed the decreases in superconductivity up to the applied pressure of 
1.68GPa in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. For the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds the 
superconductivity gradually increases, we observed maximum Tc(ρ=0)of 6.2K at pressure 
1.68GPa, which is saturated at the same value up to 1.97GPa pressure.

Figure 4 shows the log(ρ) vs 1/T plots of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2compounds at 
the various applied pressure to find out the values of energy gaps in the two different temperature 
ranges. It can be seen from the resistivity under pressure data that the normal state electrical 
resistivity decreases with increasing pressure. It has also been observed from ρ(T) data that the 
strong suppuration of normal stare resistivity is  seen till 0.97GPa and weaker suppuration later 
for the higher applied pressure for both the compounds. The resistivity data can be described in 
to distinct regions from the relation ρ(T)=ρ0eΔ/2k
B
Twhereρ0 is a constant, Δis an energy gap and 
kB is Boltzmann constant. Resistivity data in the whole temperature range is not possible to fit 
linearly in above relation so we are using the similar trained which has been used by Kotegawa 
et al. [65]. They explain the two energy gap as Δ1 and Δ2 in the temperature range 300 to 200K 
and from 20K to Tc respectively. The estimated values of the energy gaps are Δ1/kB≈201K and 
Δ2/kB≈ 11.98K for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound at zero pressure and Δ1/kB≈2024.55K and Δ2/kB
≈ 65.68K for the CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. The obtained values are comparable to the previous 
report on the same compounds [67] and significantly less than the values reported by Wolowiec 
et al. for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2compounds [68].

compounds.  Both the energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 decreases with the applied pressure from 0-
1.68GPa saturation in the decrement of energy gaps may obtained for the higher applied 
pressure, which has been reported by Wolowiec et al. [67]. Figure 5(b) shows the variation of 
calculated energy gaps (Δ1/kB, Δ2/kB) with various applied pressures from 0-1.97GPa.  It can be 
clearly seen from Figure. 5(b) that both energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 decrease rapidly with applied 
pressure of up to 1.68GPa and are almost saturated for 1.97GPa pressure. We have also obtained 
the values of energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 for the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2& NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples. At the 
ambient pressure the evaluated values of energy gaps are Δ1/kB≈108.3K and Δ2/kB≈ 4.7K for the 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound and Δ1/kB ≈160.98K and Δ2/kB ≈ 6.85K for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
compound. From the Figure 5 (c) and (d) it can be observed that the both energy gaps decreases 
rapidly with increasing the pressure. For thePrO0.5F0.5BiS2compound the first energy gap value at 
the 1.97GPa is almost saturate.

With increases pressure energy gaps decreases; it may be due the applying pressure the 
bond angle and band structure change, which positively affect the electronic and magnetic 
correlations. The applying pressure can moderate the charge carrier’s density at the Fermi 
surface in these BiS2 based systems [54]. In some theoretical studies insulator-metal transition 
with superconducting transition at low temperature under pressure has been suggested for the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [54]. In the present study, we observed that up to 1.97GPa pressure 
though there is no insulator to metal transition, but the resistivity is suppressed significantly and 
superconductivity onset transition temperature is increased for all the compounds. The

Relatively the superconductivity decreases with applied magnetic field dTc/dH is around 
0.12K/kOe from absolute Tc(ρ=0) criteria, which is near about the Fe Pnictides superconductors 
and more than the High Tc superconductors. For the other compounds CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 dTc/dH from absolute Tc(ρ=0) criteria is around 0.11K/kOe, 
0.16K/kOe and 0.179K/kOe respectively.

conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation [102] for the 90% 
criterion of the normalized resistivity data, i.e., Hc2(0)=−0.693Tc(dHc2/dT)T=Tc. The estimated 
Hc2(0) has been shown in the Figure 7 and values are 159kOe for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, 
48kOe for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, 88kOe for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, and 82kOe for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound.

without pressure are shown in Figure 8. The normal state resistivity behavior of the compound 
without applied pressure is clearly semiconducting down to superconductivity onset of around 
2.2K, and superconductivity is seen with Tc(ρ=0) at 2K. The normal state semiconducting 
behavior along with superconductivity at 2K is in agreement with reported data on 
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 superconductor [24].  
With applied pressure of 0.35GPa the normal state behavior of the resistivity changes to 
metallic and the same improves further for higher applied pressures upto 1.38GPa. For higher 
pressures of above 1.38GPa, the normal state behavior is though metallic, but with slightly less 
metallic slope. As far as normal state resistivity (ρ20K), i.e., well above superconducting 
transition temperature onset is concerned the same is 10mΩ-cm for zero pressure, 0.128mΩ-cm 
for 0.35GPa, 0.106mΩ-cm for 1.38GPa, and 0.153mΩ-cm for 1.68GPa and 1.98GPa pressures. 
Clearly the normal state resistivity at 20K, when compared with ambient pressure sample, is 
decreased by more than an order of magnitude with 0.35GPa pressure, remains within same 
range for up to 1.38GPa and later increases slightly for 1.68GPa and 1.97GPa pressures. The 
decrease in normal state resistivity (ρ20K), by more than an order of magnitude with 0.35GPa 
pressure along with the change of conduction process from semiconducting to metallic is 
surprising. It is possible that under pressure F-Sr/La-F bond angles along with the inter-atomic 
distances do change, which in turn affect the charge density at Fermi surface and hence a clear 
change in normal state electrical transport.  
As far as superconductivity i.e., Tc(ρ=0)  is concerned the same can be seen clearly from 
the inset of Figure 8, which is zoomed part of same near superconducting transition state. The 
Tc(ρ=0)  for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample without pressure is around 2K, which with applied pressure 
of 0.35GPa, and 0.55GPa is nearly the same but increases sharply to 8.6K for 0.97GPa. With 
further increase in pressure to 1.38GPa, 1.68GPa and 1.97GPa, the Tc(ρ=0)  is enhanced to above 
10K.  It is clear that superconducting transition temperature Tc(ρ=0)  remains nearly unchanged 
at around 2K for applied pressure till 0.55GPa and later increases sharply to around 10K for 
further higher pressure of 0.97GPa  and remains nearly same (10K) till 1.97GPa. The fivefold 
increase in Tc, with applied pressure of just above 1GPa is surprising and calls for the possibility 
of unconventional superconductivity in these layered BiS2 based superconductors. Such a huge 
increase in Tc and decrease in normal state resistivity at small pressure suggest the structural 
phase transition in the Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound as similar LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [42,54].

Figure 8: Resistivity versus temperature (ρVs T) plots for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound, at various 
applied pressures in the temperature range 250K-2K.Inset shows the samein the temperature 
range 20K-2.0K for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound. 
Summarizing, the results of Figure 8, It has been observed that with increasing pressure 
the normal state resistivity turns to the metallic behavior instead of the semiconducting along 
with a five-fold increase in superconducting transition temperature from 2K to 10K. This is 
though qualitatively same, but slightly different quantitatively from earlier reports on pressure 
dependent superconductivity of BiS2 based superconducting (La/Pr/Nd/Ce)O0.5F0.5BiS2 
compounds [65-80]. In particular, though nearly fivefold increase was seen for superconducting 
transition temperature [77], the normal state conduction along with normal state resistivity is not 
improved so dramatically as in present case of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 superconductor. Worth mentioning 
is the fact that this is first study on impact of hydrostatic pressure on superconductivity of 
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 superconductor. Interestingly, SrFBiS2is proposed to be the parent phase   for 
BiS2 based superconductor family [24]. The coexistence of accompanied insulator to metal 
transition and fivefold increase in Tc of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 under moderate pressure of just above 
1GPa warrants further detailed studies related to structural details under pressure and first

principle calculations to explore possible strong electronic correlations in this newest class [42, 
54] of BiS2 based superconductors.  
Figure 9 shows the temperature dependent resistivity of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 superconductor at 
0GPa and 1.97GPa pressure from 250K to 1.9K. The normal state resistance of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 at 
0GPa exhibits clearly the semiconducting behavior down to superconducting onset at 2.3K. At 
zero pressure the Resistivity versus temperature clearly shows the thermally activated behavior 
from 250K down to 2.3K.  The thermal activation energy (Δ) is obtained by fitting with thermal 
activation equation ρ(T)=ρ0exp(Δ/2kBT) for the temperature range 250K to 90K. The activation 
energy is estimated about 10.2meV, which suggests a small energy gap in this compound. 
Similar semiconducting behavior of the resistivity has earlier been reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[67,80].

Figure 9: Resistivity versus temperature (ρ Vs T) plots for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound, at 0GPa 
and 1.97GPa pressure in the temperature range 250K-2K.  
Interestingly, the charge density wave instability has been suggested recently [38] by the 
first-principles calculations, which may cause enhanced electron correlations in this system. The 
normal state resistivity shows metallic behavior as applied pressure increases. Here it can be 
clearly seen that the highest pressure 1.97GPa sample exhibit metallic conductivity with positive 
dρ/dT along with a superconducting transition at below 10K. Red solid line shows the linearly

Figure 10 shows temperature dependent electrical resistivity ρ(T) at various applied 
pressure 0.35-2.5GPa in the temperature range 2-300K for the Sr0.5Ce0.5FBiS2 compound. The 
normal state resistivity shows the semiconducting behavior of the applied pressure 0.35GPa and 
is suppressed with increasing pressure up to 1.5GPa. The normal state resistivity completely 
changes from semiconducting to the metallic at the pressure 2GPa and 2.5GPa pressures.

zoomed part of ρ(T) plots near the superconducting transition temperature. 
Inset of the Figure 10 shows the superconducting transition at various pressures. At 
pressure 0.35GPa, Tc
onset appears at 2.8K it looks like ambient pressure data with reduced 
resistivity up to the 2K Tc(ρ=0) not appears.  The Tc(ρ=0) above 2K can be seen at the pressure 
0.55GPa with the Tc
onset at 4K. The Tc(ρ=0) increases from 2K to 3K at the applied pressure 
0.97GPa with Tc
onset at 6K, which having broadening in the transition. At the pressure 1.5GPa the 
superconductivity increases as Tc
onset at 9.7K with Tc(ρ=0) at 8.5K, for the 2.0GPa pressure 
Tc
onset is 9.9K with the sharp transition. The superconducting transition temperature is nearly 
unchanged for the 2.5GPa pressure.

transition has been observed at the 2.0GPa. Inset is the zoomed part of Figure 11 in the 
temperature range 14-2K. Interestingly, at pressure 0.35GPa the compound shows Tc(ρ=0) near 
2K, and Tc

onset slightly increases 2.9K. The Tc(ρ=0) 
above 2.5K and Tc
onset is at 6K at the applied pressure 0.97GPa, the compound has large 
transition width at the this pressure. At the pressure 1.5GPa the superconductivity increases as

resistivity also observed in the Sr0.5Nd0.5FBiS2 compound from the applied pressure 0.35GPa to 
1.5GPa with decreasing resistivity. The semiconducting to metallic transition has been observed 
at the 2GPa, which is followed for the further higher pressure of 2.5GPa. Inset is the zoomed part 
of Figure 12 in the temperature range 14-2K. At pressure 0.35GPa, theTc

from 2K to 2.5K and Tc
onsetis at 5.8K, resulting in a broadened superconducting transitionat this 
pressure. For the 1.5GPa pressure, theTc(ρ=0) is 4.5K and the Tc
onsetisat 9.25K, with a further 
broadened superconducting transition. The broadening in the superconducting transition reduces 
significantly at 2.0GPa pressure with Tc(ρ=0) and Tc

further applied pressure of 2.5GPa the Tc(ρ=0)  is slightly increased to around 9K.

2.2.5 Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 
The ρ(T) from 300K to 2K at various applied pressure for the Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 is shown in 
the Figure 13. The Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 compound shows the similar nature as for RE=La, Pr and Nd, 
i.e., semiconducting to metallic transition at the 2.0GPa. So, it can be said that the 2.0GPa is 
transition pressure for Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 compound. Inset of Figure 13 is zoomed part in the 
superconducting region 14-2K.  The Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 compound shows the Tc

Figure 14 (a, b) shows the Pressure dependent superconducting transition temperature 
Tc
onsetand Tc(ρ=0) for the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 (RE=La, Ce, Nd, Pr and Sm) compounds. At the 
ambient pressure Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) has been observed only for the Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound at 
2.5 and 2.1K respectively. The Tc onset increases from 2.5K to 11K at just 0.97GPaandTc(ρ=0) 
increases from 2.1K to 8.5K. For the further higher pressure both the Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) saturate 
at 11K and 9.4K respectively.The Tc
onset observed at 2.8K for the Sr0.5Ce0.5FBiS2 
compoundTc(ρ=0) absent down to 2K and the Tc(ρ=0)  appears at the applied pressure 0.55GPa 
with the Tc
onset at 4K. The jump in both Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) observed at the pressure 1.5GPa 
increases as Tc
onset at 9.7K with Tc(ρ=0) at 8.5K, for the 2.0GPa pressure Tc
onset is 9.9K with the 
sharp transition. The Sr0.5Pr0.5FBiS2 compound at pressure 0.35GPa shows Tc(ρ=0) near 2K, and 
Tc
onset is above 2.7K, which slightly increases Tc(ρ=0) =2.5K and Tc

onset is 10K with the Tc(ρ=0) 8.8K for the 2.0GPa pressure, Tc
onset is 
unchanged and Tc(ρ=0) slightly decreases for the 2.5GPa pressure. For the Sr0.5Nd0.5FBiS2 
compound the Tc
onset increases at 9K at pressure 1.5GPa with Tc(ρ=0) at 4K. The 
superconducting transition being sharp at the pressure 2.0GPa with Tc
onset = 9.5K and Tc(ρ=0) at 
8.7K. For the Sr0.5Sm0.5FBiS2 compound Tc(ρ=0) at 2.2K obtained at 0.97GPa pressure with the 
Tc
onset = 5.6K. At 1.5GPa pressure the Tc
onset increases to 9.1K and the Tc(ρ=0) is above 3.5K, for 
pressure 2.0GPa the Tc
onset is 9.4K and Tc(ρ=0) at 8.0K. The Tc
onset  slightly decreased to 9.2K 
with Tc(ρ=0) at 8.3K at the 2.5GPa pressure. Further it seems that 1.5GPa is the transition 
pressure (Pt) for sharp increase in Tc
onset of Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 (RE=Ce, Nd, Pr and Sm) compounds. 
If we further increase the pressure (>1.5GPa), the Tonset is almost saturated, but the 
superconducting transition width is sharper in this pressure range with increased Tc(ρ=0).

clearly seen that the Tc
onsetdecreases less as compared to Tc(ρ=0) with the increasing magnetic 
field.In these compounds, under magnetic field the transition width is broadened. The upper 
critical field Hc2has been estimated from the resistivity drop 90% the normal state resistance 
ρn(T,H) at Tc
onset  in applied magnetic fields for all the samples. The upper critical field 
atabsolute zero temperature Hc2(0) can be determined by using the conventional one-band

As shown in Figure 15(f), the solid lines are the extrapolation to the Ginzburg–Landau 
equation Hc2(T)=Hc2(0)(1-t2/1+t2), where t=T/Tc is the reduced temperature which gives values 
slightly higher than that by WHH approach. These upper critical field values for all samples are 
close to but within the Pauli paramagnetic limit i.e. Hp=1.84Tc.  
2.3 SrFBiS2 
We observed an insulating normal state to metallic for compounds Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 
(RE=Ce, Nd, Pr and Sm) under hydrostatic pressure above the 1GPa, which is accompanied with 
increased superconductivity up to 10K [77]. We measure the temperature dependent electrical 
resistivity from 300K down to 2K under applied the hydrostatic pressure (0-2.5GPa) for SrFBiS2, 
i.e., parent phase for Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 compounds.  
Figure 16 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity under the different 
hydrostatic pressure (0-2.5GPa) for SrFBiS2 down to 2K. A clear semiconducting behavior can 
be observed in the temperature range 300-2K as temperature coefficient dρ/dT<0 is negative 
[96]. With increasing applied pressure the electrical resistivity significantly decrease.  At the 
applied pressures of 2.17 and 2.5GPa the electrical resistivity becomes almost temperature 
independent. The inset of the Figure 63 shows the zoomed portion of same in the temperature 
range 8K to 2K. There is no indication of superconducting transition down to 2K even after 
application of up to 2.5GPa pressure. The suppression of resistivity in SrFBiS2 under hydrostatic 
pressure is similar to the BiS2-based layered superconductors LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, 
but superconductivity is not observed.

compound SrFBiS2 compound and inset is the zoom part from 2-8K of the same. 
 
Figure 17: Pressure dependent activation (Eg) evaluated from thermally activation equation 
where solid line is a guide to eyes. Inset is the lnρVs 1/T for the different pressures (0-2.5GPa) of 
SrFBiS2 compound where solid lines are the extrapolation to the fitted portion. 
Figure 17 presents the thermal activation energy (Ea) as a function of applied hydrostatic 
pressure as obtained from fitting the resistivity to the equation ρ(T)=ρ0exp(Ea/kBT) in the 
temperature range 300-100K.  The thermal activation energy drops exponentially with pressure. 
Inset of the Figure 17 is the ln(ρ) Vs 1/T to evaluate the activation energy of SrFBiS2 from 0-
2.5GPa pressure. It is interesting to note that the value of ρ0 under different hydrostatic pressures 
remains almost same close to 7.2mΩ-cm. This observation suggests that at highest temperature 
the resistivity of sample is almost constant even under different hydrostatic pressure. The 
activation energy decreases with increasing pressure and saturates close to 5.3meV. This 
suggests that the Fermi energy moves close to conduction band by increasing pressure while 
highest temperature resistivity remains constant. The detailed spectroscopic and theoretical 
investigations needed under pressure to validate this point.

(~99.9%) rare earth metal (La, Ce, Pr and Nd), rare earth oxide (La2O3, Nd2O3, Pr6O11, & 
CeO2,), Rare earth Fluoride, Bismuth, and Sulfur chemicals are taken in the stoichiometric ratio 
and ground thoroughly in the glove box (MBRAUN Lab star) filled with Argon gas of high 
purity (4N). The mixed powder subsequently palletized and Vacuum sealed (10-4mbar) in quartz 
tube. The vacuum encapsulated samples were heated in the box furnace at temperature 800oC 
with typical heating rate of 2oC/min for 12h. Another BiS2-based Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 compound was 
synthesized by using high purity La, SrF2, Bi and S. The process is similar up to the vacuum 
encapsulation step. The box furnace was used to sinter the sample at 650oC for 12h with the 
typical heating rate of 2oC/min. The sintered samples were subsequently cooled down slowly 
with the cooling rate 5oC/min to room temperature.  
The electrical transport measurements were performed on Physical Property 
Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) as a function of both temperature and 
applied magnetic field. The pressure dependent resistivity measurements were performed by 
usingHPC-33 Piston type pressure cell with Quantum design DC resistivity Option on PPMS-
14T, Quantum Design. Hydrostatic pressures were generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped piston-
cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a fluid pressure transmitting medium of Fluorinert 
(FC70:FC77=1:1) in a Teflon cell. The resistivity measured by using four point probe method. 
Annealed Pt leads were affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver 
epoxy in a standard four-wire configuration. The pressure at low temperature was estimated from 
the superconducting transition temperature of Pb. 
4. Conclusion 
Impact of external pressure on the Superconductors play an important for the discovery 
of new superconductors. In this regards, the high TcCuprates and Fe-based superconductors had 
already set the superconductivity research in the forefront of condensed matter physics. 
Similarly, the newly discovered BiS2 based compounds responded in a big way towards the 
impact of hydrostatic pressure on their superconductivity.  In this review the electrical resistivity 
under hydrostatic pressure for BiS2 base new superconductors is presented in a consolidated way 
at one place.
