Abstract.
Through the solid state reaction method, we synthesized a new BiSe2-based
superconductor Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 with superconducting transition temperature Tc≈3.8
K. A strong diamagnetic signal below Tc in susceptibility χ(T ) is observed indicating
the bulk nature of superconductivity.
Diﬀerent to most BiS2-based compounds
where superconductivity develops from a semiconducting-like normal state, the present
compound exhibits a metallic behavior down to Tc.
Under weak magnetic ﬁeld or
pressure, however, a remarkable crossover from metallic to insulating behaviors takes
place around Tmin where the resistivity picks up a local minimum. With increasing
pressure, Tc decreases monotonously and Tmin shifts to high temperatures, while the
absolute value of the normal state resistivity at low temperatures ﬁrst decreases and
then increases with pressure up to 2.5 GPa. These results imply that the electronic
structure of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 may be diﬀerent to those in the other BiS2-based systems.

Superconductivity and abnormal pressure eﬀect in Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 superconductor

1. Introduction
Exotic superconductivity has been discovered in materials with layered crystal
structures, such as the high-Tc cuprates[1] and the Fe-based superconductors[2] where
the high-Tc or unconventional superconductivity is believed to be caused by the reduced
dimensionality and electronic correlations. Recently, a new layered compound Bi4O4S3
with Tc ≈8.6 K[3, 4] has triggered intensive research interests, leading to a class of
BiS2-based superconductors including LnO1−xFxBiS2(Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd) with Tc up
to 10 K[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Similar to the CuO2 plane in cuprates and the Fe2An2 (An =
P, As, Se) layers in pnictides, the common BiS2 layer in the BiS2-based compounds
is expected to play a key role in search for new superconductors by intercalating
various block layers, for example, the Bi4O4(SO4)1−x or [Ln2O2]2−layers. Following
this idea, through the replacement of the LaO layer by the SrF block, a new class
of BiS2-based superconductors Sr1−xLnxFBiS2(Ln=La, Ce) with Tc ≈2.8 K has been
studied[11, 12, 13]. By ﬁrst principle calculations the parent compounds SrF(LnO)BiS2
are found to be band insulators without detectable antiferrimagnetic transition or
structure phase transition[14]. Superconductivity can be induced by electron doping
into lattice[5] and enhanced by pressure[15].
To obtain higher Tc in these materials, various chemical substitutions have
been attempted to alter the structural instability[5, 11, 16].
Among these, the
isovalent substitution is a clean method to supply chemical pressure.
Very recently,
an isostructural LaO1−xFxBiSe2 compound has been reported to exhibit enhanced-
superconductivity with Tc of 3.5 K[17, 18] compared to the low-Tc phase in
LaO1−xFxBiS2[5, 15].
Although the ARPES experiments[19] have suggested that
the electronic structure and Fermi surface are quite similar in both compounds, the
normal state of LaO1−xFxBiSe2 shows the metallic behavior[17] in contrast to the
semiconducting behavior of LaO1−xFxBiS2. On the other hand, the applied physical
pressures in BiS2-based compounds always induce a structure phase transition from
tetragonal to monoclinic [20], leading to an abrupt improvement from low-Tc to high-
Tc[15]. For LaO1−xFxBiSe2, the reported pressure eﬀect is to suppress the low-Tc but
enhance the high-Tc[21]. Up to now, most studies including electronic structure[14],
superconducting transition temperature[15] and the pairing symmetry[22, 23, 24, 25, 26,
27] have been mainly focused on the BiS2-based system, but superconductivity seems
to be still under debate.
In the Letter, we report the successful synthesis of a novel La-doped Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2
sample. The compound is iso-structural to SrFBiS2 with the P4/nmm space group as
conﬁrmed by the XRD pattern measurement. Both the sharp superconducting transition
in ρ(T) and strong diamagnetic signals in χ(T) conﬁrm the bulk superconductivity.
In contrast to most of the BiS2-based compounds where the normal state exhibits a
semiconducting behavior, Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 exhibits a metallic behavior down to Tc.
Interestingly, even a weak magnetic ﬁeld or a weak pressure can induce a crossover
from metallic to insulating behaviors in the normal state. In particular, by increasing

3
pressure, superconductivity is quickly suppressed.
Accompanied with the decrease
of Tc, the normal state resistivity ﬁrst decreases and then increases with pressure.
In any cases, the resistivity has a local minimum at Tmin where the crossover from
metallic to insulating behaviors takes place. We ﬁnd that Tmin gradually shifts to high
temperature with increasing pressure or ﬁeld. All these observations imply that the
superconducting mechanism of the present system may be distinct from that of the
BiS2-based superconductors.
2. Experimental
The polycrystalline sample of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 used in this study was synthesized by
the two-step solid state reaction method.
La2Se3 was pre-synthesized by reacting
stoichiometric Se powders and La pieces at 1273 K for 15 hours. The as-grown La2Se3
and the powders of SrSe, SrF2, Bi, and Se as starting materials were weighted according
to their stoichiometric ratio and then fully ground in an agate mortar. The mixture of
powders was then pressed into pellets, heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 1073 K
for 10 hours and ﬁnally furnace-cooled to room temperature.
Crystal structure characterization was performed by powder X-ray diﬀraction
(XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation
and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters were calculated from least-squares
ﬁtting routine using Rietveld ﬁtting. The (magneto)resistivity under several magnetic
ﬁelds was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering temperature range
from 2 to 300 K in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system and Oxford He3-
16T system.
The temperature dependence of d.c.
magnetization was measured on
a Quantum Design SQUID-VSM-7T. Measurement of resistivity under pressure was
performed up to 2.5GPa on PPMS-9T by using HPC-33 Piston type pressure cell with
the Quantum Design DC resistivity and AC transport options. Hydrostatic pressures
were generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped piston-cylinder cell.
The sample was
immersed in a pressure transmitting medium (Daphne Oil) covered with a Teﬂon cell.
Annealed Au wires were aﬃxed to contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in
a standard four-wire conﬁguration.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Superconductivity
Fig.
1 shows the powder XRD patterns and the Rietveld structural reﬁnement of
the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 sample.
The main diﬀraction peaks can be well indexed based
on a ZrCuSiAs-type crystal structure with the P4/nmm space group except for two
impurity phases, the Bi2Se3 and a starting material Bi. The reﬁned lattice parameters
are extracted to be a = 4.1697˚A and c = 13.9422˚A, which are larger than those of
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with a = 4.0820 ˚A and c = 13.8025 ˚A, respectively[5].

Temperature dependence of resistivity (ρ) for Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 under ambient
pressure is plotted in Fig. 2. The inset of ﬁgure 2 shows the magnetic susceptibility
under ZFC(Zero-Field cooling) and FC(Field cooling) modes with a magnetic ﬁeld
of 5 Oe.
The strong diamagnetic signals are observed below 3.5 K. The estimated
volume fraction of magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 90%, bearing out the bulk
superconductivity in our sample. The resistivity displays a metallic behavior in the
whole temperature region above Tc, and, a linear temperature-dependence above 100 K.
Such feature is in contrast to the semiconducting feature observed in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2[11]
and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2[5]. Noted that the single crystal NdO0.5F0.5BiS2[28] also exhibits
the metallic behavior above Tc.
This result seems to be a tendency of the metallic
normal state in the BiS2- and BiSe2-based superconductors. Upon further cooling, a
sharp superconducting transition with Tc of 3.8 K, which is sizably higher than that of
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with Tc ∼2.8 K, can be clearly seen. Considering the relatively larger
radius of Se ion than that of S ion, the result seems to imply that the negative chemical
pressure eﬀect may enhance the superconductivity in the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 system.
Fig. 3(a) shows the low-temperature magnetoresistivity under various magnetic
ﬁelds below 6 K for the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 sample. The sharp superconducting transition
with fully vanished resistivity at about 3.5 K is clearly seen at zero-magnetic ﬁeld,
suggesting the good quality of the poly-crystalline sample. A relatively weak H (∼0.8 T)
suppresses Tc drastically, and induces an non-zero resistivity above 2 K, implying a low
Meissner ﬁeld due to the pinning of ﬂux. The inset shows the temperature dependence of
the upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2(T), determined by using the 90% normal state resistivity
criterion. The Hc2 at zero temperature estimated by using the Werthamer-Helfand-
Hohenberg(WHH) formula Hc2(T) = −0.69Tc| ∂Hc2
∂T |Tc is about 5.5 T for T onset
c
. This
value is rather large compared to that of the Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 system[11].
A logarithmic plot of the magnetoresistivity vs. temperature below 50 K with the
applied magnetic ﬁeld up to 9 T is shown in Fig. 3(b). Clearly, the resistivity shows a
metallic behavior under zero ﬁeld. Small magnetic ﬁelds cause a slight upturn above Tc
and broaden the superconducting transition. With increasing magnetic ﬁeld Tc shifts to
lower temperature, while the value of resistivity gradually increases so that the upturn
feature becomes more prominent. At higher ﬁeld up to 9 T, superconductivity almost
vanishes, instead, the ρ(T) curves show a metal to semiconductor crossover around Tmin,
followed by a near logT-dependent feature at lower temperatures. The similar behavior
was also observed in the LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 crystal at 2.0 GPa[21]. As a result, the phase
diagram in terms of magnetic ﬁeld and temperature is mapped in Fig. 4.
3.2. Pressure eﬀect
It is known that pressure is an eﬀective method to tune the lattice structures and the
corresponding electronic states without introducing more disorders. We performed the
resistivity measurement for several diﬀerent pressures, shown in Fig.
5.
The inset
shows the close view of resistivity transition below Tc at various pressures. A relatively

weak pressure can sizably reduce Tc but only slightly broaden the superconducting
transition. Further increasing pressures, Tc shifts to lower temperatures quickly while the
superconducting transition remains rather sharp. At higher pressures up to 2.5 GPa, a
slight drop due to superconducting transition can be distinguished below 2.2 K. The fact
that Tc decreases monotonously with pressure in the present Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 sample is
in contrast to other BiS2-based superconductors such LnO1−xFxBiS2 and Sr1−xLnxFBiS2
systems[29, 30], where the Tc is enhanced to 10 K by pressure. In the LaO1−xFxBiSe2
and Eu3F4Bi2S4 systems[21, 31, 32], while the superconducting phase with low-Tc is
relatively unchanged, the one with a high-Tc is enhanced with Tc ≈10 K up to 2.5 GPa.
Fig. 6 displays a close view of temperature dependence of resistivity at several
representative pressures.
Starting from 0.9 GPa, a resistivity upturn above Tc is
induced by pressure. The upturn feature becomes more pronounced with increasing
pressures, resulting in a clear crossover from metallic to semiconducting behaviors
around Tmin where the resistivity takes a local minimum.
Apparently, Tmin shifts
toward higher temperatures with pressures. It is noted that the value of ρ300K decreases
with pressure, while ρ10K ﬁrst decreases below 1.3 GPa and then increases above 1.5
GPa.
Consequently, while superconductivity is suppressed by pressure, the log(T)-
dependence of resistivity in the normal state emerges. The region with this insulating
feature increases quickly with pressure. Therefore compared with the pressure eﬀect
on other mentioned materials the pressure eﬀect in the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 compound is
abnormal. The measurement under further higher pressures should be highly desirable
in the future in order to clarify whether the superconductivity in Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 could
be completely killed by pressure.
The phase diagram of pressure vs.
temperature is summarized in Fig.
7.
In
the superconducting state, Tc in the present system decreases monotonously with
pressure up to 2.5 GPa, in contrast to the universal features in other BiS2-based
superconductors. In the normal state, the sample shows a highly metallic character
in the whole temperature at ambient pressure, but undergoes a crossover from metallic
to insulating behaviors when the physical pressure is beyond 0.9 GPa. With pressure up
to 2.5 GPa, the superconductivity is suppressed and the sample becomes more insulating
at low temperatures. Recall that Tc is enhanced in most BiS2- or BiSe2-based compounds
as typically in LaO1−xFxBiSe2 where Tc is enhanced to 6.5 K at 2.37 GPa [21]. The
opposite pressure eﬀect in our measured sample though with the similar BiS2 layered
structure may suggest a rather diﬀerent electronic band structure.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we synthesized the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 polycrystalline sample. The resistivity
vanishes below 3.8 K, which together with strong diamagnetic signals in magnetization
data, conﬁrming the bulk superconductivity.
In contrast to most of the BiS2-
based compounds where superconductivity is developed from the background of a
semiconducting-like normal state, the normal state of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 exhibits a

metallic behavior down to Tc.
Under magnetic ﬁeld or pressure, a crossover from
metallic to semiconducting behaviors is induced, and the superconductivity is suppressed
accordingly. While the Tc decreases with increasing monotonously, the absolute value
of the normal state resistivity ﬁrst decreases and then increases with pressure. All these
features are in contrast to the previously known BiS2-based superconductors.
While the semiconducting behavior in the normal state of most BiS2 and
BiSe2 remains one of the puzzling issue in connection with the unconventional
superconductivity, the opposite situation in the present compound, namely, the crossover
from the metallic to semiconducting behaviors in the normal in the presence of magnetic
ﬁeld or pressure is rather unusual, pointing to a possible diﬀerent mechanism of
superconductivity in this family of materials.
Such feature reminds us of a related
single crystal compound Nd(O,F)BiS2[33], where the normal state exhibits the ﬁeld-
induced semiconducting behavior above Tc. This feature was attributed to the possible
pseudo-gap phase extending to relatively higher temperatures as evidenced by the
unusual superconducting ﬂuctuations seen in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS)
experiment[33]. We thus expect that the superconducting mechanism of the present
system may be also quite unique and deserve further investigations such as by ARPES,
NMR or STS experiments in future.
