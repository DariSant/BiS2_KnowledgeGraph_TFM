Abstract – We report the effects of Ce substitution on structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of 
layered bismuth-chalcogenide La1xCexOBiSSe (x = 00.9), which are newly obtained in this study. 
Metallic conductivity was observed for x  0.1 because of electron carriers induced by mixed valence 
of Ce ions, as revealed by bond valence sum calculation and magnetization measurements. Zero 
resistivity and clear diamagnetic susceptibility were obtained for x = 0.20.6, indicating the emergence 
of bulk superconductivity in these compounds. Dome-shaped superconductivity phase diagram with the 
highest transition temperature (Tc) of 3.1 K, which is slightly lower than that of F-doped LaOBiSSe (Tc 
= 3.7 K), was established. The present study clearly shows the mixed valence of Ce ions can be utilized 
as an alternative approach for electron-doping in layered bismuth-chalcogenides to induce 
superconductivity. 
 
Introduction – Since the discovery of BiCh2-based (Ch: S, 
Se) superconductors in 2012, this family of compounds has 
received much attention as a new class of layered 
superconductors [13]. The crystal structure composed of 
alternate stacks of electrically conducting BiCh2 layers and 
insulating (blocking) layers, which is schematically depicted 
in the inset of Fig. 1, is similar to that of cuprate or Fe-based 
high-transition-temperature 
(Tc) 
superconductors 
[4,5]. 
Several types of BiCh2-based superconductors have been 
reported, and the record Tc of 11 K was obtained so far [3,6]. 
Although many experimental and theoretical studies have 
been conducted to clarify the superconductivity mechanism 
and to increase the Tc of BiCh2-based superconductors, the 
nature of superconductivity is still under debate [7]. In the 
early studies including theoretical calculation [8], Raman 
scattering [9], muon-spin spectroscopy [10], and thermal 
conductivity 
[11] 
experiments 
suggested 
conventional 
mechanisms with fully gapped s-wave. However, recent first-
principles calculation [12], angle-resolved photoemission 
spectroscopy [13], and Se isotope effect [14] proposed 
unconventional 
pairing 
mechanism 
in 
BiCh2-based 
superconductors. Therefore, systematic characterization is still 
crucial to clarify the superconductivity mechanisms of these 
compounds. 
Primarily, superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds is 
induced by electron carrier doping into conduction band, 
which mainly consists of Bi 6p and Ch p orbitals [7,15]. In 
addition, recent studies have demonstrated that the emergence 
of bulk superconductivity requires optimization of crystal 
structure. This can be qualitatively described in terms of 
sufficient overlapping of Bi 6p and Ch p orbitals, namely, in-
plane chemical pressure [16]. A typical route to induce in-
plane chemical pressure is Se substitution for S site [1719]. 
It has been reported that such pressure effects successfully 
suppressed the in-plane disorder of BiCh2 conducting layer, 
which was revealed by means of synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure, and 
neutron diffraction [16,2023]. Intrinsic superconductivity 
phase diagram mitigating in-plane disorder was recently 
established for LaO1xFxBiSSe [23]. 
On the carrier doping method for BiCh2-based compounds, 
aliovalent ion substitution including partial substitution of F 
for O2 ions in REOBiCh2 (RE: rare earth or Bi) [2430], or 
RE3+ substitution for A2+ ions in AFBiCh2 (A: Ca, Sr, Eu) 
[3136], 
have 
been 
typically 
employed 
to 
induce

superconductivity. 
It 
was 
also 
reported 
that 
the 
superconductivity appears via M4+ substitution at La3+ site in 
LaOBiS2 (M: Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) [37]. Recently, zero resistivity 
was reported in CeOBiS2, which is most likely due to electron 
doping via mixed valence state of Ce ions [38]. However, bulk 
superconductivity is yet to be confirmed in neither M4+-doped 
LaOBiS2 nor CeOBiS2, on the basis of magnetic susceptibility 
or specific heat, which is a sensitive probe for bulk 
superconductivity. 
In the present study, we synthesized a new BiCh2-based 
superconductor system La1xCexOBiSSe (x = 00.9) and 
investigated the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. 
Metallic conductivity was observed for x  0.1, indicating 
electron carrier was doped by mixed valence state of Ce ions, 
as 
revealed 
by 
bond 
valence 
sum 
calculation 
and 
magnetization 
measurements. 
Bulk 
superconductivity, 
confirmed by zero resistivity and clear diamagnetic signal, 
was observed for x = 0.20.6. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first report on the emergence of bulk 
superconductivity and metallic conductivity by substituting 
the RE site of REOBiCh2 and using the mixed valence state of 
Ce ions in BiCh2-based layered compounds. 
 
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS – Polycrystalline samples of 
La1xCexOBiSSe with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 
and 0.9 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. 
Powders of CeO2 (99.99%), La2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), 
Ce2S3 (99.9%), Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.999%) 
were mixed in the stoichiometric ratio, pressed into pellet, and 
heated at 700 C for 20 h in a sealed quartz tube. The obtained 
sample was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated with the 
same heating condition. 
The obtained samples were characterized using powder X-
ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu K radiation (Rigaku, 
Miniflex 600 equipped with a D/teX Ultra detector) by the 
2 method. The crystal structure parameters were refined 
using the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP code [39]. 
Crystal structure was depicted using VESTA software [40]. 
Chemical composition analysis was performed using scanning 
electron microscope (Hitachi, TM3030) equipped with an 
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX; Oxford, 
SwiftED3000). Seebeck coefficient (S) at room temperature 
was measured by giving a temperature difference (T) of ~4 
K, where the actual temperatures of both sides of the bulk 
were monitored by two thermocouples. The thermo-
electromotive force (V) and T were simultaneously 
measured, and the S were obtained from the linear slope of the 
VT plots. Temperature (T) dependence of electrical 
resistivity () was measured using a four-terminal method. 
Magnetization as a function of T was measured using a 
superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) 
magnetometer with an applied field of 10 Oe after both zero-
field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) using Magnetic 
Property Measurement System (Quantum design, MPMS-3). 
 
RESULTS – Figure 1 shows XRD pattern and the Rietveld 
fitting result for x = 0.3 as a representative sample. Almost all 
the diffraction peaks can be assigned to those of the 
LaOBiSSe-type phase, indicating that this is a dominant phase

in 
the 
samples, 
although 
minor 
diffraction 
peaks 
corresponding to CeO2 impurity phase (< 6 wt%) were also  
observed. We have tested several annealing conditions for the 
Ce-substituted samples, but the CeO2 impurity phase cannot  
be eliminated. Therefore, we have investigated the physical 
properties of the La1-xCexOBiSSe system with the samples 
obtained by the present annealing condition. Note that the 
sample with nominal x = 1 is excluded from further 
experiments because it contains significant amount of Bi2Se3 
and CeO2 impurities. 
Lattice parameters decrease with increasing x, as 
shown in Figure 2(a), primarily due to smaller ionic 
radius of Ce than that of La ions. Notably, it can be seen 
that diffraction peaks were broadened when the chemi-
cal composition was apart from the end member, as 
presented in Figure 2(b), most likely due to the local 
inhomogeneity of the crystal structure of these phases 
[41]. We note that symmetry lowering has been report-
ed for x = 0 using synchrotron XRD equipped with a 
high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detec-
tor [23]. However, the previous report also determined 
that the crystal structure of the F-doped (electron-
doped) LaOBiSSe system was tetragonal, without 
symmetry lowering. Therefore, it is most likely that the 
crystal structure of present Ce-doped (electron-doped) 
La1xCexOBiSSe is also tetragonal P4/nmm. Chalcogen 
site occupancies were determined using Rietveld meth-
od imposing linear constraints to maintain their total 
occupancies in the stoichiometric one. Se occupancy at

the in-plane Ch1 site was higher than 85% for all sam-
ples, indicating that Se ions selectively occupy the in-
plane Ch1 site, rather than the out-of-plane Ch2 site, 
which is consistent with the observations in related 
BiCh2-based layered compounds [1719, 23]. We evalu-
ated the valence state of La/Ce site using bond valence sum 
(BVSRE). The BVSRE was calculated using the following pa-
rameters: b0 = 0.37 Å, R0 = 2.172 Å for LaO bond, 2.151 Å 
for CeO bond, 2.64 Å for LaS bond, 2.62 Å for CeS bond, 
2.74 Å for LaSe bond, and 2.74 Å for CeSe bond [42,43]. 
Experimental bond distances between La/Ce and nine coordi-
nating anions were determined using Rietveld analysis. Site 
occupancies of both La/Ce sites and chalcogen sites were 
included in the calculation of the BVS. The BVSRE of x = 0 
was evaluated to be 2.98, corresponding to 3+ valence state of 
La ions. The BVSRE tends to increase with increasing x and it 
reaches 3.15 for x = 0.9, as listed in Table 1. These results 
strongly suggest the mixed valence of Ce ions in 
La1xCexOBiSSe, as in the case of CeOBiS2, in which Ce 
mixed valence was demonstrated using X-ray absorption spec-
troscopy [44,45]. 
Figure 3 shows the S at room temperature for x = 00.9. 
Negative values of S indicate that the majority of carrier is 
electrons in all samples. Assuming single parabolic band 
model and acoustic phonon scattering as a dominant scattering 
process for carrier transport, the S for metals or degenerate 
semiconductors is given by:

where n is the carrier concentration and m* is the effective 
mass of the carrier [46]. Absolute value of S tends to decrease 
with increasing x, indicating that electron carrier was doped 
into the conduction band by Ce substitution. 
Figure 4(a)(c) shows the T dependences of  for x = 00.9. 
For x = 0,  increases with decreasing T below 70 K (Fig. 
4(a)). In contrast, metallic behavior was observed for x  0.1, 
namely, the  decreases with decreasing T. The metallic 
conductivity originates from electrons that provided to BiCh2 
conducting layers [23] via the mixed valence of Ce ions. 
Regarding the superconducting characteristics, a steep 
decrease of  attributable to Tconset was observed for x  0.1 
(Figs. 4(b) and (c)). However, zero resistivity was obtained 
only for x = 0.20.6, and the highest Tczero was 3.1 K for x = 
0.30.5. 
Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependences of 
magnetization below 4 K with an applied magnetic field of 10 
Oe after ZFC for La1xCexOBiSSe. Clear diamagnetic signals 
corresponding to superconductivity are observed for x = 
0.20.6, in consistent with the zero resistivity states of the 
samples in T data, indicating that the observed 
superconducting states are bulk in nature. The largest 
shielding volume fraction and the Tc of 3.1 K were obtained 
for x = 0.3, as plotted in Figure 5(b). The large shielding 
volume fraction exceeding the full diamagnetic response can 
be understood by the large demagnetization effect due to the 
presence of plate-like grains [47]. Magnetization measured 
under FC shows the onset to superconducting state as same as 
that measured under ZFC, as shown in Fig. S2, while 
diamagnetic signal is noticeably weak because the present 
samples are a type-2 superconductor with a strong pinning 
effect. Although measuring specific heat around Tc is one of 
the best way to confirm the bulk nature of superconductivity 
for this system, it is challenging to characterize a 
superconducting transition from specific heat because 
magnetic entropy of Ce 4f electrons should overwhelm the 
electronic specific heat jump at a superconducting transition 
[48].

On the basis of the measurement results of electrical 
resistivity and magnetization, a superconductivity phase 
diagram was depicted in Figure 6. Weakly localized transport 
behavior was observed in T for x = 0 below 70 K. This 
behavior was immediately suppressed, and metallic-like T 
was observed for x  0.1. The decrease of  attributable to a 
superconducting transition was observed for x = 0.10.9, and 
Tconset was ranged from 2.9 to 3.7 K in this region. While, zero 
resistivity and clear diamagnetic signal corresponding to the 
emergence of the bulk superconductivity states were achieved 
for x = 0.20.6. A dome-shaped superconductivity phase 
diagram, with the highest Tczero of 3.1 K for x = 0.30.5, was 
obtained. 
Indeed, 
superconductivity 
of 
BiCh2-based 
compounds are essentially sensitive to its local structure 
fluctuation. In the case of a Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystal, a bulk 
superconducting transition occurs below 5 K, while 
superconducting gap, measured by spectroscopy, remains up 
to 26 K [49]. Besides, a sharp superconducting transition was 
observed for optimally doped LaO1xFxBiSSe with x = 0.20.5 
[23]. This suggests that the present samples exhibiting broad 
phase transition (x = 0.1, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) contains local 
inhomogeneity/fluctuations of their crystal structure, although 
these samples show relatively narrow peak widths of the XRD 
(Fig. 2(b)). To get further information about local structure 
inhomogeneity or structural fluctuations, experiments that 
sensitive to local structure such as extended X-ray absorption 
fine structure (EXAFS), are needed. 
 
DISCUSSION – In order to examine the Ce valence state 
from magnetization measurements, CurieWeiss fitting using 
M/H = C/(TCW) to the data of 1 T was performed, where C 
is Curie constant and CW is paramagnetic CurieWeiss 
temperature. Note that the magnetization data from 5 to 20 K 
are employed because 1 shows shoulder-like anomaly at 
around 100 K due to crystalline-electric-field effects [48]. 
CurieWeiss fitting result of x = 0.1 is shown in Fig. 7 as a 
representative sample, and the analogous data of other 
samples are presented in Fig. S3. For x = 0.1, C was evaluated 
to be 0.011 emu/K mol, indicating Ce valence state is +3.64. 
As listed in Table 1, Ce valence tends to decrease with 
increasing x, resulting in +3.32 for x = 0.9. The decrease of Ce 
valence seems to be correlated with increased in-plane 
chemical pressure because lattice constant a decreases with x 
(Fig. 2(b)). In the case of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex system, the 
increase of in-plane chemical pressure suppress the mixed 
valence of Eu ions, which is demonstrated using a combined 
analysis of X-ray absorption near-edge structure and X-ray 
photoelectron spectroscopy [50]. It should be noted that while 
Ce valence tends to decreases with increasing x, the averaged 
RE valence (trivalent La and mixed-valent Ce) increase with x, 
in consistent with that obtained using BVS calculation (Table 
1).  
It is interesting to note that an anomaly in the temperature 
dependence of magnetization was observed at around 8 K for 
x = 0.5, as depicted in Fig. S4. It has been reported that 
magnetic moment of Ce3+ ions of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 orders 
ferromagnetically, which was demonstrated using neutron 
scattering measurements [51]. Therefore, the magnetic 
anomaly for x = 0.5 at 8 K would be attributable to the 
ferromagnetic ordering of Ce3+ moment, as well. The valence 
states and magnetism of Ce in La1xCexOBiSSe are believed 
to be essentially sensitive to its chemical composition and/or 
(local) crystal structure. As an example, X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy revealed that mixed valence of Ce ions was 
suppressed by F doping for CeO1xFxBiS2 [44,45]. We note 
that the present samples are not single phase but contain CeO2 
impurity phase (< 6 wt%) (Figs 1 and S1). It has been 
reported that CeO2 clusters may significantly contribute to the 
observed magnetic behavior [52]. Further investigation of 
local crystal/electronic structure is required to clarify the 
detailed 
relationship 
between 
magnetism 
and 
superconductivity in La1xCexOBiSSe. 
The highest Tc of 3.1 K in La1xCexOBiSSe is slightly lower 
than that of F-doped system, LaO1xFxBiSSe (Tc = 3.7 K) 
[14,23]. The present results suggest that substitution at 
different sites (substituting whether the O site or the La site) 
in blocking layer affect the superconducting properties of 
BiCh2-based superconductors. For example, it has been 
reported that carrier doping via partial substitution for the site 
spatially far from the superconducting Fe plane results in 
higher Tc in Fe-based superconductor BaFe2As2 [53]. It was 
also demonstrated that the decrease in Tc originates from 
magnetic pair breaking by interaction of the localized 4f 
orbitals in the RE dopants with the itinerant Fe 3d orbitals for 
the corresponding compound [54]. 
 
CONCLUDING REMARKS – In summary, we have 
synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system 
La1xCexOBiSSe. Polycrystalline samples for x = 00.9 were 
prepared by a solid-state reaction. Crystal structure analysis 
showed that both lattice constants a and c decrease with 
increasing 
x.

these compounds. Carrier doping into BiCh2 conducting layer 
by Ce substitution is confirmed by the measurements of S. 
Metallic-like T plots were observed for x  0.1. Zero 
resistivity and clear diamagnetic signal corresponding to bulk 
superconductivity were obtained for x = 0.20.6. A dome-
shaped superconductivity phase diagram, with the highest Tc 
of 3.1 K for x = 0.30.5, was established. This work clearly 
showed the emergence of bulk superconductivity and metallic 
conductivity via mixed valence state of Ce ions in BiCh2-
based layered compounds.

La1xCexOBiSSe measured at 1 T. Red solid lines represent the CurieWeiss fitting lines. 
Note that the magnetization data from 5 to 20 K are employed because 1 shows 
shoulder-like anomaly at around 100 K due to crystalline-electric-field effects when 
magnetic field was applied along c-axis (R. Higashinaka et al. J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. 84, 
023702 (2015).).
