The random-phase approximation (RPA) is here applied to a two-orbital model for the BiS2-based supercon-
ductors that was recently proposed by Usui et al., arXiv:1207.3888. Varying the density of doped electrons per
Bi site, n, in the range 0.46 ≤n ≤1.0, the spin ﬂuctuations promote competing A1g and B2g superconducting
states with similar pairing strengths, in analogy with the A1g-B1g near degeneracy found also within RPA in
models for pnictides. At these band ﬁllings, two hole-pockets centered at (0, 0) and (π, π) display nearly paral-
lel Fermi Surface segments close to wavevector (π/2, π/2), whose distance increases with n. After introducing
electronic interactions treated in the RPA, the inter-pocket nesting of these segments leads to pair scattering with
a rather “local” character in k-space. The similarity between the A1g and B2g channels observed here should
manifest in experiments on BiS2-based superconductors if the pairing is caused by spin ﬂuctuations.

Introduction.—The recently discovered family of layered
bismuth oxy-sulﬁde superconductors1–22 has immediately at-
tracted considerable attention from the Condensed Matter
community due to its close similarities with the famous iron-
pnictide superconductors.23–27 As in the case of other layered
unconventional superconductors, such as the cuprates and the
aforementioned iron pnictides/chalcogenides, this new fam-
ily displays a layered structure involving BiS2 planes where
the observed superconductivity is believed to reside.
The
ﬁrst report of superconductivity originated in Bi4O4S3, with
Tc = 4.5 K.1 Superconductivity has also been reported in
ReO1−xFxBiS2, where Re = La, Nd, Ce, and Pr, with cor-
responding Tc = 10.6,2 5.6,5 3.0,15 and 5.5 K.17 These com-
pounds are metallic in the normal state and Density Functional
Theory calculations indicate that the relevant bands crossing
the Fermi surface (FS) originate mainly from the Bi 6p or-
bitals, as shown, e.g., for LaO1−xFxBiS2.3 However, con-
trary to the majority of the Cu- and Fe-based unconventional
superconductors, no magnetically ordered phase has been de-
tected thus far in the BiS2 compounds. This apparent ab-
sence of magnetism in the BiS2 compounds may still locate
them in the same category as LiFeAs, FeSe, and possibly
Sr2VO3FeAs,24 that are also non magnetic but their pairing
properties are widely believed to still originate in short-range
magnetic ﬂuctuations. For these reasons, and despite the ab-
sence of observed long-range magnetism in BiS2, it is impor-
tant to study the potential role of spin ﬂuctuations in these
novel materials and the pairing channels that those ﬂuctua-
tions tend to favor, to help in the analysis of experimental data.
In this manuscript, the two-orbital (2-orbital) model re-
cently introduced by Usui et al. is adopted.3 The fact that
the relevant orbitals in BiS2 compounds are p-type, where
Coulomb interactions should be smaller than in d orbitals,
turns RPA into a suitable technique, whose results deserve a
careful analysis if electron correlations are found to be impor-
tant for superconductivity in these materials. Similar calcula-
tions for a related four-orbital model3 are underway. Note that
in Ref. 3 a brief discussion of RPA calculations has already
been presented. The results discussed by Usui et al. consisted
of a single set of couplings (equivalent to our J/U = 0.2 cal-
culations below) at n = 0.5. Their early weak-coupling RPA
analysis is here expanded via a systematic study of the inﬂu-
ence of the band ﬁlling n and the identiﬁcation of the domi-
nant channels for superconductivity under the assumption of
a spin ﬂuctuations mechanism. The main novel contribution
of our present effort is the identiﬁcation of closely competing
B2g and A1g gap functions as the dominant pairing channels,
particularly for band ﬁllings around n = 0.5. At quarter ﬁll-
ing (n = 1.0), another pair of almost degenerate gap func-
tions (with symmetries A2g and B1g) is found to closely com-
pete with the previously mentioned dominant pair, especially
at J/U = 0.3.

ﬁllings: n = 0.46 (solid red), n = 0.50 (dashed green), n = 0.65
(dotted blue), and n = 1.00 (dot-dashed magenta). Note that close
to the (π/2, π/2) wavevector, where the n = 0.46 pockets almost
touch, the increase of n decreases the radius of the hole-pockets and,
more importantly, the adjacent FS segments (inside the dashed box)
become more and more parallel. (b) Lindhard function χ0 for the
same ﬁllings as in panel (a). Note that the position in k-space of the
leftmost peak is clearly associated to FS nesting through a (kn, 0)
vector, as indicated in the inset, which zooms-in the dashed box in
panel (a). Indeed, the position of the leftmost peaks in χ0 agree
(within a few percent) with the vectors indicated in the inset (see text
for details, especially Fig. 5). Obviously, there are additional nesting
vectors that become evident in a 2-d plot of χ0 [Fig. 5(b)].
µ = 1.10375, 1.12514, 1.21828, and 1.52621 (in principle,
n = x in LaO1−xFxBiS2).3 Panel (b) shows the correspond-
ing non-interacting magnetic susceptibilities χ0. The leftmost
peaks in χ0, located at (kn, 0), with 0 ≲kn ≲π/2 as the ﬁll-
ing varies from n = 0.46 to 1.0, can be associated to FS nest-
ing once it is noticed that their position matches the horizon-
tal separation between the two adjacent FS segments from the
pockets centered at (0, 0) (Γ) and (π, π) (M), as highlighted
by the dashed box in panel (a) and sketched in the inset to
panel (b). Note that the horizontal separation is well deﬁned if
the two FS segments are parallel, which is the limiting case as
n increases, as shown in the inset, to n = 1.0 (for details, see
Fig. 5 and the associated discussion). It is also important to re-
mark that once interactions are introduced, the leftmost peak
in χ0 is the one that diverges in the RPA calculation of the
spin susceptibility χRPA for almost all the ﬁllings and various
values of interaction parameters. This divergence indicates a
tendency to magnetic order, or at least strong spin ﬂuctuations
(paramagnons), with characteristic wavelength determined by
(kn, 0). Our analysis is not extended into the n ≤0.45 re-
gion since there the topology of the FS changes (see Ref. 3
for details of the FS at lower ﬁllings28).

where the notation is standard and the many terms have been
described elsewhere.29 Here, the usual relation U ′ = U −2J
is assumed, and J/U is a parameter. Calculations were done
for 0.1 ≤J/U ≤0.4, in steps of 0.1, for the four ﬁllings n =
0.46, 0.50, 0.65, and 1.0. The multi-orbital RPA calculations
performed here follow closely those described in Ref. 30, and
previous works by the authors.29,31 All results were obtained
at temperature T = 10−4 and an imaginary part η = 10−5
was used to regularize the Green’s functions.
Our RPA results for spin-singlet pairing link the dominant
superconducting gap functions to spin ﬂuctuations, which
originate in FS nesting and are enhanced by electronic inter-
actions. The particular relative topology of the two adjacent
hole-pockets (see Fig. 1) promotes pairing whose strength is
independent of the global symmetry of the pairing functions
[see Fig. 4(b)]. Indeed, the B2g and A1g symmetries have
essentially the same pairing strength, which is determined
by pair scattering between these two adjacent FS segments
(see Fig. 5) close to (π/2, π/2) in the Brillouin Zone (BZ).
In addition, our results show that both dominant gap func-
tions change sign between these two segments (Figs. 2 to 4),
and the pairing is through the intraorbital scattering channel
[Fig. 3(b)]. The near degeneracy A1g-B2g is the analog of the
near degeneracy A1g-B1g found also in RPA calculations for
the pnictides,30 since the pocket structures in both cases can
be related by a 45o rotation. Results for spin-triplet pairing
are presented in the supplemental material at the end of the
manuscript.
Results and Discussion. As mentioned above, the most im-
portant feature of the FS for ﬁllings between 0.46 and 1.0 is
that the hole-pockets centered at the Γ and M points present
almost parallel segments close to the (π/2, π/2) wavevector,

A1g at n = 1.0. (b) Main panel: normalized pairing strengths λ for
the dominant (A1g, solid red curve) and subdominant (B2g, dashed
green curve) gap functions. Although the two curves are very close,
the eigenvalues are not degenerate. In the inset, the structure of the
subdominant gap function (B2g) is shown. When compared to that
of the dominant one [A1g in panel (a)], it is clear that the structure
around (π/2, π/2) is very similar for both of them, explaining why
the pairing strengths (eigenvalues) are the same. The region inside
the dashed box, in panel (a), is analyzed in detail in Fig. 5(a).
becoming more and more parallel as the pockets shrink, with
increasing ﬁlling [see Fig. 1(a) and inset in Fig. 1(b)]. In
Figs. 2 and 3 it will be shown that this has important con-
sequences for the spin ﬂuctuations and the superconducting
pairing associated to this 2-orbital model.
Indeed, as dis-
played in the main panel of Fig. 2(a) (solid (red) curve), there
is a divergence in the RPA spin susceptibility for very small k
values: k0.46 ∼(π/25, 0) for n = 0.46, and k0.50 ∼(π/8, 0)
for n = 0.50 [panel (b)]. A divergence in the spin susceptibil-
ity χRPA may point to magnetic order, or at least to strong spin
ﬂuctuations with wave vector kn. Figure 3(a) shows the same
calculations, but now for n = 0.65. Note that although χ0
displays a broad-peak structure around (π, π) [see Fig. 1(b)],
χRPA does not present a divergence in this region. In the in-
sets to Figs. 2(a) and (b), and Fig. 3(a), it is shown that the
dominant gap function at the FS has symmetry B2g for the
three cases, showing that despite the changes in the size of
the hole-pockets the results are qualitatively the same. Fig-
ures 3(b) and (c) contain the orbital contribution (X, red solid
curve; Y , green dashed curve) of the BZ states at the FS for the
Γ and M pockets, respectively. It is interesting to note that the
modiﬁcations in the position of the peak in χRPA correlates

χ0 also for n = 1.0. The horizontal (blue) vector in panel (a) con-
nects the maximum amplitude of the gap-function in both pockets.
Note also the horizontal (blue) vector in panel (b) along the kx direc-
tion, indicating the position of the maximum value of χ0. These two
vectors agree up to a difference smaller than the width of this maxi-
mum peak in χ0. Therefore, it can be shown (see text) that the line
describing the position of the points in the M pocket in relation to
the points in the Γ pocket, as indicated by the two additional vectors
(black and red) in panel (a), satisﬁes ky ∼−kx + kn, where (kn, 0)
and (0, kn) are the positions of the maxima in χ0 (with n = 1.0).
This equation also describes the line of local maxima of χ0, as seen
in panel (b), originating from FS nesting.
well with the “separation” between the Γ and M hole-pockets
in the region around (π/2, π/2). For the purposes of describ-
ing our results, this separation will be deﬁned as the horizontal
distance between two parallel lines tangent to the hole-pockets
at the points where each intercepts the Γ−M (Σ) line. As de-
scribed in more detail in Fig.5(a) [and already mentioned in
connection with Fig.1(a)], as the ﬁlling increases these seg-
ments of FS approach more and more the parallel lines just
deﬁned, justifying the deﬁnition just given.
The RPA results for the gap functions also point to an inter-
esting effect, namely, the small value of kn for ﬁllings 0.46 ≤
n ≤1.0 results in the pairing strength depending on very “lo-
cal” properties of the gap function at the adjacent segments of
the hole-pockets. This implies that the pairing strength of gap
functions with different symmetries is very similar, as long as
they have the same “local” properties. To demonstrate that,
in Fig. 4(a) the dominant gap function (with A1g symmetry)
is shown for n = 1.0 and J/U = 0.3. It is clear that this is
very similar in structure to the subdominant one shown in the
previous ﬁgures. In the inset to Fig. 4(b) the subdominant gap
function with symmetry B2g is displayed for the same param-
eters. Comparing it with the dominant gap function in panel
(a) note that, despite having different symmetries, the two gap
functions are identical in the two adjacent hole-pocket seg-
ments that cross the Σ line.
For this reason, their pairing
strengths as measured by λ (the eigenvalues of the Eliashberg
Equation), and shown in the main panel of Fig. 4(b), are the
same to the third decimal place. Note that the two eigenvalues
for symmetries A1g and B2g are not degenerate. This seems
a strong indication that the “local” aspect of the pair scatter-
ing, as mentioned above, seems to be determinant to estab-

that there are relevant nesting features along the ky = −kx + k1.0

avoid having a peak at (k1.0, 0) that would wash out the features in

lish the pairing properties of this model, at least in our RPA
weak-coupling approach. It should be noted that the eigen-
value results shown in Fig. 4 are basically identical to those
for lower ﬁllings, shown in previous ﬁgures, with the only
difference being the order of the dominant and subdominant
symmetries. Since their eigenvalues are almost identical for
all ﬁllings studied, this does not have a special signiﬁcance.
Note that χRPA for n = 1.0 and J/U = 0.3 (not shown)
follows the same trends as described in Figs. 2 and 3. From
the orbital composition in Fig. 3(b) and the gap structure in
Fig. 4 it appears that the symmetry of the B2g and A1g pairing
operators is determined by the orbitals, while the spatial form
in both cases is characterized by symmetric nearest-neighbor
pairing with rotational invariance. Thus, the pairing operators
have the form ∆† = f(k)(d†

where the + (−) sign corresponds to A1g (B2g) symmetry
with f(k) =
cos kx + cos ky, plus higher harmonics with
A1g symmetry.
Figure 5(a) shows in more detail the almost parallel FS seg-
ments of the two hole-pockets for n = 1.0. In this ﬁgure, the
horizontal (blue) vector that was deﬁned above as the separa-
tion between the two FS segments is displayed. A vector with
the same length is reproduced in panel (b), where a 2d plot
of χ0 in the ﬁrst quadrant of the BZ is also shown. It clearly
indicates that the position kn of the main peak in χ0 is exactly
given by the horizontal separation. Not only that, the (red)
vector along the Σ line in panel (a) is also reproduced in panel
(b) and it coincides also exactly with a local maximum of χ0.
In fact (see in both panels the black vectors located at angle
α), the locus of the ridge of local maxima in χ0 in panel (b)
exactly coincides with the BZ points deﬁned by the vectors
connecting the two FS segments for 0 ≤α ≤π/2. Figure 6
shows the RPA spin susceptibility for n = 1.0. The similarity
between these results and those in Fig. 5(a) is clear, indicat-
ing that the FS nesting for the interacting system is the one
described by the vectors in Fig. 5. Finally, an important issue
should be highlighted: the four points in the hole-pockets in
Fig. 5(a) where the gap function has a very pronounced peak,
are exactly the two pairs of points (one in each pocket) con-
nected by (k1.0, 0) and (0, k1.0). This fact clearly links the
pairing properties with the spin ﬂuctuations. Note also that
for n = 1.0 and J/U = 0.3, the second pair of eigenvalues
(λ3 = 0.9038 and λ4 = 0.9036) corresponds to symmetries
A2g and B1g, respectively (not shown). The same occurs for
J/U = 0.1 and J/U = 0.2, also for n = 1.0 (but the eigen-
values are smaller). Yet, the same explanation as described in
Fig. 5 applies. See the supplemental material for a connection
between the emergence of a B1g symmetry at n = 0.50 with
the one-dimensionality of the bands.
Conclusions. Summarizing, a weak-coupling RPA analy-
sis of a minimal 2-orbital model was used to investigate the
pairing properties of the BiS2-based superconductors. Fill-
ings between 0.46 and 1.0 were analyzed. The Hund’s cou-
pling was varied in the range 0.1 ≤J/U ≤0.4. Qualita-
tively, the results are similar for all values of J/U and differ-
ent ﬁllings. In the RPA results described here, a clear rela-
tionship is found between quasi FS nesting, spin ﬂuctuations,
and superconductivity: the topology of the two hole-pockets
is such that they present almost parallel segments close to the
(π/2, π/2) wavevector in the BZ. It is found that the horizon-
tal distance (kn, 0) between the tangents to these segments at
the points where they cross the Σ line is also where the non-
interacting susceptibility χ0 has a pronounced peak at (kn, 0),
for 0.46 ≤n ≤1.0. Once interactions are introduced, this
peak will diverge at a certain critical coupling U for each ﬁll-
ing, and all the values of J/U studied (with exception of one:
n = 0.5, J/U = 0.1). In addition, a line of local maxima,
connecting the BZ points (kn, 0) and (0, kn), is clearly ob-
served in a 2-d plot of χ0. As expected, this line can also be
associated to FS nesting. This nesting structure gives origin to
pairing functions with similar eigenvalues, i.e., similar pairing
strengths, and symmetries B2g and A1g. This close competi-
tion originates in the FS quasi nesting properties, which deter-
mine the spin-ﬂuctuation-mediated inter-pocket pair scatter-
ing. This pair scattering is overwhelmingly between two adja-
cent FS segments, therefore the properties of the pairing func-
tions, including the pairing strength, are quite “local”, hav-
ing almost no dependence on their global symmetry. One can
then predict that pairing symmetry measurements may con-
tain a mixture of both symmetries if the pairing mechanism is
driven by spin ﬂuctuations.

around the (π, 0) points. To obtain these pockets, hopping matix
elements to considerably larger distances have to be added to the
Hamiltonian considered here. The authors of Ref. 3 ascertained
that the presence or not of these pockets does not alter the main
RPA results (private communication).

SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
Spin-triplet pairing. We also tested the two-orbital model
for the case of spin-triplet pairing. Using the same RPA all the
four ﬁllings studied in this work were investigated, but calcu-
lations were carried out only for J/U = 0.2 and 0.3. All
the critical values obtained for the Hubbard repulsion U were
slightly above those obtained for the singlet pairing channel.
However, they were close enough to warrant a brief discussion
in this supplemental material. Note that in Usui et al.3 the pos-
sibility of spin-triplet pairing was mentioned, in connection
with the similarity of the BiS2 bands with those of Sr2RuO4,
in regards to their common one-dimensionality character. Fig-
ure S1 shows the gap functions [dominant in panel (a) and
subdominant in (b)] for parameters n = 0.5, J/U = 0.3,
and U = 1.416. This critical value of U should be compared
with that obtained for singlet pairing for the same parameters
(i.e., U = 1.363, see Fig. 2(b) in the main text). The symme-
tries for both the dominant (B2g) and subdominant (A1g) gap
functions in the spin-triplet channel are the same as for the
spin-singlet channel. The main difference here is that they do
not have as competing pairing strengths as in the spin-singlet
channel. Indeed, the eigenvalues for Fig. S1 are λ1 = 1.00
and λ2 = 0.88, while for the same parameters in the spin-
singlet channel their values are λ1 = 0.989 and λ2 = 0.985.
Quasi one-dimensionality. As mentioned in the main text,
the two-orbital model has a quasi one-dimensional (1d) char-
acter, with the hopping between next-nearest-neighbor being
dominant (tX,Y
x±y = 0.88, see the Table in the main text con-
taining the hoppings).
It is then interesting to verify how
the results are modiﬁed in case all the other hoppings are re-
moved from the two-orbital model Hamiltonian, except for
tXY
x
= 0.05. The energies of the orbitals were kept the same
as in the original model. RPA calculations for the spin-singlet
pairing channel were done for n = 0.5 (with correspond-
ing chemical potential µ = 1.18037278), J/U = 0.2, and
J/U = 0.3. In addition, the spin-triplet pairing channel was
investigated for J/U = 0.3, but, again, the critical value ob-
tained for the Hubbard U was higher than for the singlet chan-
nel, therefore, these results are not shown. Singlet pairing
results for both values of the Hund’s coupling were similar,
therefore, just the results for J/U = 0.3 will be presented.

inset, χ0 for the truly 1d Hamiltonian (obtained when just the dom-
inant hopping is taken in account, tX,Y
x±y = 0.88). The arrows indi-
cating peaks located at (k, k) in the BZ are reproduced in Fig. S4.
These peaks indicate different spin ﬂuctuations which may lead to
electronic pairing.
Figure S2 shows the band structure for high symmetry lines
of the BZ. The Fermi energy is located at EF = 0.0. The
two hole-pockets obtained are identical and nearly square (see
Fig. S4), their corners being slightly rounded due to the pres-
ence of the ﬁnite tXY
x
= 0.05 hopping. For tXY
x
= 0.0 the
hole-pockets are perfectly square and the two bands are de-
generate along the Γ −M (Σ) line.
Figure S3 shows, in the main panel (solid red curve), the
non-interacting magnetic susceptibility (Lindhard function)
χ0 obtained from the bands in Fig. S2. The inset shows, as
a reference, χ0 for the truly 1d Hamiltonian (i.e., tXY
x
=
0.0). A comparison of these two χ0 curves in Fig. S3 with
the one for the fully two-dimensional (2d) two-orbital model
(Fig. 1(b) in the main text) shows that the introduction of a
small tXY
x
= 0.05 brings the 1d model χ0 (green curve in the
inset) qualitatively close to the 2d result. To see that, com-
pare the solid (red) curve in the main pannel of Fig. S3 with

FIG. S4: (Color online) (a) Dominant and (b) subdominant gap func-
tions in the singlet channel for the quasi 1d model. The parameters
used are n = 0.5, J/U = 0.3, and U = 0.8086. The arrows in-
dicate pair scattering processes associated to the peaks in Fig. S3,
which are there indicated with the corresponding line style (see text
for details).
the dashed (green) curve in Fig. 1(b) of the main text. As
will be described next, the extra peaks introduced in the Σ
line (main panel of Fig. S3) have a marked inﬂuence in the
singlet pairing gap functions. Indeed, Fig. S4(a) shows the
dominant gap function (with symmetry B1g) for n = 0.5 and
J/U = 0.3. The four vectors connecting local maxima (with
opposite signs) of the gap function are exactly the same that
locate the four (k, k) peaks in χ0 in the main panel of Fig. S3.
This, once again, shows the strong connection between spin
ﬂuctuations and electron pairing. Panel (b) shows the sub-
dominant gap function, with symmetry A2g. Their eigenval-
ues are the same up to the third decimal place. It is easy to
see that the vectors displayed in the B2g gap function [panel
(a)] apply identicaly to the subdominant A2g in panel (b). It
is also interesting to observe that a possible extra set of pair
scattering processes, leading to change of sign in the A2g gap
function, are the ones connecting adjacent sides of the same
hole-pocket. Two of them are indicated by double-headed ar-
rows. However, these processes do not occur, as there are
no peaks in χ0 that can provide spin ﬂuctuations with these
two wave vectors (see Fig. S3). This results in the pairing
strengths of both gap functions being basically the same.
The presence of a relatively large number of different pair-
ing spin ﬂuctuations, as implied in Fig. S4, suggests that the
RPA spin susceptibility should have competing peaks when U
is close to the critical value. Figure S5 indicates that this is in-
deed the case. There we show χRP A for the same parameters
as Fig. S4, for three different values of Hubbard interaction
U = 0.77 (dotted blue curve), 0.79 (dashed green curve), and
0.8 (solid red curve). As a comparison, at the same ﬁlling
n = 0.5 and J/U = 0.3, for the full 2d model studied in
the main text, the leftmost peak (Fig. 2(b), main text), at a
comparable ratio U/Uc as the ones in Fig. S5, is a few orders
of magnitude above the other peaks. Similar results are seen
for the other ﬁllings and J/U values, indicating that there is
mainly a single dominant pairing process in the 2d model in
the main text. In the 1d model it seems as if the different wave
vector spin-ﬂuctuations cooperate to produce pairing.

FIG. S5: (Color online) RPA spin susceptibility for the quasi 1d two-
orbital model Hamiltonian, n = 0.5 and J/U = 0.3. Three curves
are shown for values of Hubbard U close to the critical value Uc =
0.8686: U = 0.77, 0.79, and 0.8. A competition between two peaks
can be clearly observed. They are indicated by the same type of
arrows as the ones for the corresponding peaks in Fig.S3.
