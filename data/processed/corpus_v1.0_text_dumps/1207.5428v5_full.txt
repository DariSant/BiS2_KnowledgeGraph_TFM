ABSTRACT: Very recent report1 on observation of supercon-
ductivity in Bi4O4S3 could potentially reignite the search for su-
perconductivity in a broad range of layered sulfides. We report 
here synthesis of Bi4O4S3 at 5000C by vacuum encapsulation 
technique and its basic characterizations. Bi4O4S3 is contaminated 
by small amounts of Bi2S3 and Bi impurities. The majority phase 
is tetragonal I4/mmm space group with lattice parameters a = 
3.9697(2)Å, c = 41.3520(1)Å. Both AC and DC magnetization 
measurements confirmed that Bi4O4S3 is a bulk superconductor 
with superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 4.4K. Iso-
thermal magnetization (MH) measurements indicated closed loops 
with clear signatures of flux pinning and irreversible behavior. 
The lower critical field (Hc1) at 2K, of the new superconductor is 
found to be ~15 Oe. The magneto-transport R(T, H) measure-
ments showed a resistive broadening and decrease in Tc (ρ=0) to 
lower temperatures with increasing magnetic field. The extrapo-
lated upper critical field Hc2(0) is ~ 31kOe with a corresponding 
Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of ~100Å . In the normal state 
the ρ ~ T2 is not indicated. Hall resistivity data show non-linear 
magnetic field dependence. Our magnetization and electrical 
transport measurements substantiate the appearance of bulk su-
perconductivity in as synthesized Bi4O4S3. On the other hand 
same temperature heat treated Bi is not superconducting, thus 
excluding possibility of impurity driven superconductivity in the 
newly discovered Bi4O4S3 superconductor. 
The discovery of superconductivity at 26K in LaO1−xFxFeAs2 
has ignited a gold rush in the search of new superconductors. 
Besides popular Fe based pnictides2,3 and chalcogenides4, some 
new interesting systems have also appeared. To name some, they 
are CeNi0.8Bi2
5, BiOCuS6 and doped LaCo2B2
7. The supercon-
ducting transition temperatures of these systems are around 4K. 
These compounds are layered with relatively large unit cells and 
mimic the superconducting characteristics of CuO2 based HTSc 
cuprates and FeAs based pnictides. A comprehensive theoretical 
understanding of the mechanisms of CuO2 and FeAs based high 
temperature superconductivity is still awaited. The hybridization 
of Cu-O and Fe-As in these strongly correlated systems along 
with their multiband character has been of prime interest to the 
scientific community8,9. After the recent observations of super-
conductivity in BiOCuS6 and doped LaCo2B2
7, it is a pertinent 
question to ask if CuS and CoB could also play the same role as 
of CuO2 and FeAs. In this regards, it is worth mentioning that 
although superconductivity of BiOCuS could not be reproduced10, 
the CeNi0.8Bi2 and doped LaCo2B2 still lack independent confir-
mation. For example the volume fraction of superconductivity in 
CeNi0.8Bi2 is very small11. In this sense, the observation of super-
conductivity at around 4K in Bi4O4S3
1 has once again started the 
debate; whether this newest series of superconductivity is intrinsic 
or not. It is suggested that superconductivity of Bi4O4S3 is BiS2 
based and doping mechanism is similar to that of cuprates and 
pnictides12,13.  The central question is whether the observed super-
conductivity in Bi4O4S3 is intrinsic or it is being triggered by Bi 
impurity in the matrix. 
Bismuth has been a part of various superconducting com-
pounds, such as Bi based High Temperature cuprates (BSSCO)14, 
Bi3Ni15,16 and CeNi0.8Bi2
5 compounds. On the other hand, pure 
Bismuth is found in several phases, out of which ordinary 
rhombohedral Bi phase is non-superconducting17,18, while some 
other phases are found to be superconducting19-23. Various crystal-
lographic phases of pure Bi, which are superconducting in the 
bulk phase, are Bi II, III and V (high-pressure phases of Bi) with 
Tc = 3.9K, 7.2K, and 8.5K19-21 respectively. The fcc Bi phase 
superconducts with Tc ~ 4K22; and amorphous Bi with Tc = 6K23. 
In the current communication, we report on the extensive char-
acterization of the newly discovered1 Bi4O4S3 superconductor. 
The synthesized Bi4O4S3 is crystallized in tetragonal structure 
with space group I4/mmm. The main phase of the sample is con-
taminated with small impurities of Bi and Bi2S3. Bi4O4S3 com-
pound is found to be bulk superconducting at around 4.4K, as 
confirmed from magnetization and transport measurements. Inter-
estingly same route heat treated pure Bi is non-superconducting. 
Bi is in rhombohedral phase and hence is non-superconducting. 
Our results conclude that superconductivity of Bi4O4S3 is intrinsic 
and not driven by Bi impurity phase.    
Bi4O4S3 was synthesized by solid state reaction route via vacu-
um encapsulation. High purity Bi, Bi2O3 and S were weighed in 
right stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in the glove box 
under high purity argon atmosphere. The powders were subse-
quently pelletized and vacuum-sealed (10-4 Torr) in separate 
quartz tubes. Sealed quartz ampoules were placed in box furnace 
and heat treated at 5000C for 18h followed by cooling to room 
temperature naturally. The process was repeated twice. The X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) pattern of the compounds was recorded on 
Rigaku diffractometer. Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern was 
carried out using FullProf software. The magnetization and 
transport measurements were carried out using 14 Tesla Cryogen-
ic PPMS (Physical Property Measurement System).  
The synthesized Bi4O4S3 sample is gray in color. On the other 
hand, Bi sample is of shiny silver color. The room temperature 
XRD pattern for synthesized Bi and Bi4O4S3 samples are shown in 
Figure l (a).

The Bi4O4S3 sample is crystallized in tetragonal structure with 
space group I4/mmm. Rietveld refinement of XRD patterns are 
carried out using reported1 Wyckoff positions. The positions and 
lattice parameters are further refined. The lattice parameters thus 
obtained are a = 3.9697 (2)Å and c = 41.3520 (1)Ǻ. The Wyckoff 
positions of the Bi4O4S3 compound are given in Table 1. The XRD 
pattern of same temperature heat treated Bi, is also depicted in 
Figure 1 (a), which is crystallized in clean rhombohedral phase. It 
can be concluded from XRD results that the synthesized Bi4O4S3 
sample is nearly single phase with some impurities of 
rhombohedral Bi and Bi2S3.  Rhombohederal Bi is reported to be 
non-superconducting17,18.  
The structure of Bi4O4S3 is still under debate within the space 
group crystallization of I4/mmm or I -42m1. The representative 
unit cell of the compound in I4/mmm space group crystallization 
is shown in Figure 1 (b). The layered structure includes Bi2S4 
(rock-salt type), Bi2O2 (fluorite type) and SO4 layers. Supercon-
ductivity is induced in BiS2 layer due to Bi-6p and S-3p orbitals 
hybridization. The theoretical calculations13 show that, bands are 
derived from Bi-6p and in-plane S-3p orbitals. These are dominat-
ing bands for electron conduction and superconductivity.

Table 1. Rietveld refined Wyckoff positions and fractional 
occupancies of the atoms in Bi4O4S3. 
Various atoms with their respective positions are labeled in 
Figure 1(b) and their coordinates are provided in Table 1. Bismuth 
(Bi1, Bi2 and Bi3) and Sulfur (S1 and S2) atoms occupy the 4e (0, 
0, z) site.  S3 atom is at 2b (0, 0, ½) site. O1 is situated at 8g (0, 
½, z) and the O2 atom is positioned at 16n (0, y, z) site. The struc-
tural refinement indicates that the molecular composition is 
Bi3O3S2.25. It is the normalization of Bi4O4S3 composition by ¾. 
The superconducting phase (i.e. Bi4O4S3 or Bi3O3S2.25) is 25% 
SO4 deficient composition of the parent Bi3O4S2.5 (Bi6O8S5) com-
pound1.  
 
 
Figure 2. Temperature variation of DC Magnetization in ZFC and 
FC mode for Bi4O4S3 compound at 20Oe, onset Tc is identified at 
4.4K. Inset shows the expanded part of the same plot indicating 
irreversible behavior.  


 
The DC magnetic susceptibility of Bi4O4S3 sample is shown in 
Figure 2. The magnetization is done in both, FC (Field cooled) 
and ZFC (Zero-field-cooled) protocols under applied magnetic 
field of 20Oe.The compound shows sharp superconducting onset 
at 4.4K, which is clear from the zoomed inset of Figure 2. There 
is evidence for substantial flux trapping too. The bifurcation of 
FC and ZFC below Tc marks the irreversible region. The shielding 
fraction as evidenced from ZFC diamagnetic susceptibility is 
~95%. Both FC and ZFC magnetization data confirm the appear-
ance of bulk superconductivity in Bi4O4S3. In order to exclude the 
role of Bi impurity in superconductivity of Bi4O4S3, we measured 
the magnetization of the same temperature (5000C) heat treated Bi 
and found the same to be non-superconducting (plot not shown). 
It can be seen in Figure 1, that the 5000C heat treated Bi is crystal-
lized in non-superconducting17,18 rhombohedral phase. This ex-
cludes the possibility of un-reacted Bi driven superconductivity in 
Bi4O4S3. In fact the sufficient superconducting volume fraction 
and large shielding (~95%) of our studied sample, discards the 
possibility of the minor impurity phase driven superconductivity.   
The AC susceptibility versus temperature χ(T) behavior of the 
Bi4O4S3 sample is exhibited in Figure 3. AC susceptibility is done 
at 1kHz and 10Oe AC drive field. DC applied field is kept zero to 
check the superconducting transition temperature and is increased 
to 5kOe and 10kOe to further check the AC loses in the mixed 
state. Both the real (χ/) and imaginary (χ//) part of AC susceptibil-
ity were measured. Real part (χ/) susceptibility shows sharp transi-
tion to diamagnetism at around 4.4K, confirming bulk supercon-
ductivity. The imaginary part on the other hand exhibits a single 
sharp peak in positive susceptibility at around the same tempera-
ture. Presence of single sharp peak in χ// is reminiscent of better 
superconducting grains coupling in studied Bi4O4S3 superconduc-
tor. Under applied DC field of 5kOe the χ/ diamagnetic transition 
is shifted to lower temperature of 2.6K and the corresponding  χ// 
peak is broadened and shifted to same lower temperature. This is 
usual for a type-II superconductor. At 10kOe DC field neither χ/ 
nor χ// show any transitions, indicative of rapid suppression of 
superconductivity. 
Figure 3. AC susceptibility χ(T) behavior of the Bi4O4S3 sample at 
frequency 1 kHz and AC drive amplitude 10Oe under various (0, 
5, 10kOe) DC applied fields. 
  
 Figure 4 shows the isothermal MH curve of the sample at 2K, 
up to applied field of 3kOe. Upper inset of the figure shows the 
same up to 1kOe. The MH curve (lower inset) shows that the ini-
tial flux penetration and the deviation from linearity marks lower 
critical field (Hc1) of this compound  ~15 Oe (at 2K). Wide open 
MH loop of the studied Bi4O4S3 compound demonstrates bulk 
superconductivity.  
 
Figure 4. Isothermal magnetization with field (MH) at 2K in an 
applied field up to 3kOe. Insets of the figure show the same in 
smaller field ranges. Hc1 (2K) is estimated to be 15Oe.   
 
Figure 5 depicts the resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) meas-
urement with and without applied magnetic field. The resistivity 
of the sample decreases with temperature and confirms supercon-
ductivity with onset Tc ~4.4 K. The normal state conduction (inset 
Figure 5) is of metallic type and a T2 fitting is found to be inap-
propriate implying non-Fermi liquid behavior. With applied field 
of 1, 2 and 5kOe, the Tc (ρ = 0) decreases to 3.2, 2.7 and 2K.With 
further higher fields of 10 and 20kOe, the Tc (ρ = 0) state is not 
observed and only Tc (onset) is seen. As sketched in Figure 5, we 
have estimated upper critical field Hc2 (T) by using the conserva-
tive procedure of intersection point between linear slope lines of 
normal state resistivity and superconducting transition line. While 
the applicability of WHH (Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg) ap-
proximation can be debated in this new superconductor, a simplis-
tic single band extrapolation leads to Hc2(0) (= - 0.69 Tc 
dHc2/dT|Tc) value of 31kOe. From this the Ginzburg-Landau co-
herence length xHc2)1/2 is estimated to be ~100 
Å

range of 2-300K.  


 
 
A strong magneto-resistance in the normal state is also seen 
that can possibly be ascribed to reasons similar to extra Mg impu-
rity in MgB2 i.e. due to Bi impurity in the matrix. It is predicted 
by the theoretical calculations that superconductivity in BiS2 lay-
ers is of multiband type13,24. In Figure 6 we plot the Hall resistivi-
ty as a function of magnetic field at 10K. The dominance of elec-
tronic charge carrier in normal state conduction mechanism is 
confirmed. Strong non-linearity is observed with increasing mag-
netic field that is suggestive of the deviations from single band 
analysis.  
 The Hall coefficient [Figure 6 Inset (a)] is field dependent and 
the carrier concentration at low field is estimated to be ~1.53×1019 
per cm3 at 10K that increases to ~2.4×1019 per cm3 at 300K.  
 
Figure 6. Hall resistivity is plotted as a function of magnetic field 
at T = 10K.  Inset (a) shows variation of Hall coefficient as a func-
tion of field. Inset (b) shows normalized magneto-resistance at 
5K, implying non- H2 dependence.   
In the inset (b) of Figure 6, we show versus H2 at 
5K for fields up to 20kOe. One of the established features of 
multiband superconductivity is the dependence  H2in 
low field rangeEvidently, in this regime, this dependence is not 
seen. Taken in totality, we can conclude that while our Hall resis-
tivity data may demand incorporation of more rigorous analysis, 
the magneto-resistance aspects in Bi4O4S3 could be well due to Bi 
impurity.  
In conclusion we have synthesized the new layered sulfide 
Bi4O4S3 superconductor and established its bulk superconductivi-
ty by magnetization and transport measurements. Detailed 
Reitveld analysis determines the molecular composition as 
Bi3O3S2.25. The coherence length is estimated to be ~100Å. A 
departure from strong electron-electron correlation in the normal 
state is indicated. The Hall resistivity yields non-linear magnetic 
field dependence.
