Abstract: We report the phase diagram of NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) 
compound. The samples synthesized by the vacuum encapsulation technique are crystallized 
in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. The superconductivity of all samples is confirmed by 
DC magnetic susceptibility and electrical transport measurements. The highest 
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) onset of 5.25K is seen for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. 
Superconductivity is suppressed with applied magnetic field, as both Tc
onset and Tc (ρ =0) are 
decreased to lower temperatures in magneto transport ρ(T, H)  measurements. Upper critical 
field Hc2(0) is estimated to be above 3Tesla for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. The Arrhenius 
equation is used to calculate the thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) activation energy (U0) 
for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample, which is 61.64 meV in 0.02Tesla field. Hall Effect measurements 
show that the electron charge carriers are the dominating ones through out the studied 
temperature range of 300K – 2K.  
 
Key Words: BiS2 based new superconductor, structure, magnetization and transport

Introduction: 
Recently discovered layered BiS2 based superconductors, with Tc=8.6K in Bi4O4S3 
and Tc=3-10 K in (La/Nd/Ce/Pr)O0.5F0.5BiS2 have been reported by many scientific groups 
[1-10]. Successful growth of the superconducting ReO1-xFxBiS2 (Re-La, Nd, & Ce) single 
crystals confirmed the intrinsic nature of superconductivity in these materials [11, 12]. The 
BiS2 layer of these layered compounds is responsible for superconductivity, which is similar 
to the CuO2 planes in high Tc cuprate superconductors [13] and the FeAs planes in iron based 
superconductors [14]. The parent phase of ReOBiS2 (Re= La, Nd, Ce, & Pr) compounds 
exhibits bad metals or a Mott insulator behavior [5, 15]. The substitution of F-1 at O-2 in the 


 
2
oxide blocks (ReO) induces superconductivity in these compounds via electron doping. The 
ReO layer acts as spacer block in ReO1-xFxBiS2 compounds. Superconductivity has also been 
observed via hole doping i.e., by La3+ substitution at the site of Sr2+ site in similar structure 
SrFBiS2 compound [16]. More recently, observation of superconductivity is reported via 
substitution of tetravalent Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4, and Ti+4 for trivalent La+3 in LaOBiS2 compound 
[17]. Basically superconductivity appears by various carrier doping routes in the vicinity of 
the insulating-like state of the un doped parent BiS2-based systems viz. ReOBiS2 and SrFBiS2 
[5, 15-17]. Thus these systems are very sensitive to the carrier doping level, and 
superconducting properties can be changed with the variation of doping concentration level 
[9, 16]. The size of the band gap between the conduction and the valence bands play an 
important role in determining the actual carrier concentration. As expected, electrons are 
significantly doped from the nominal fluorine content in NdO1-xFxBiS2 [9, 18]. Hall Effect 
measurements suggest that though electron are the dominant carriers, the multiband features 
are also seen and the superconducting pairing occurs in the quasi two dimensional chain in 
these systems [15]. Theoretical studies show that the electron carriers are originated from the 
Bi 6p orbital and the superconductivity occurs in the BiS2 plane [18, 19]. Thus the 
fundamental parameters, such as the upper critical field Hc2, charge carrier density and their 
type etc, are important to identify the superconducting mechanism in these novel BiS2 based 
superconductors. It is well known that the normal state properties, such as the Hall Effect and 
magneto-resistance, can lend crucial information about the fundamental parameters of a 
material.    
In this paper, we extend our previous work on NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 [20] superconductor to 
see the effect of Fluorine composition in NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 & 0.9) 
compounds on superconducting transition temperature (Tc) and other fundamental 
parameters. All the synthesized samples are crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group. 
With increasing the doping level of F the lattice parameter (c) decreases till x=0.7. The 
superconducting temperature with Tc onset ~5.25K is highest for nominal Fluorine doping of 
x=0.7 and the same is decreased for higher concentration of x=0.9. We present the AC 
susceptibility, electrical resistivity under magnetic field and Hall Effect measurement of the 
maximum Tc NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. 
 
Experimental: 
 
 
The polycrystalline bulk NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 & 0.9) samples are 
synthesized by standard solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Nd, 


 
3
Bi, S, NdF3, and Nd2O3 are weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove 
box in high purity argon atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and 
vacuum-sealed (10-4 mbar) in a quartz tube. The box furnace have been used to sinter the 
samples at 7800C for 12h with the typical heating rate of 2oC/min. and sintered samples 
subsequently cooled down slowly to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-
ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range 
of 10o-80o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). 
Rietveld analysis was performed using the standard FullProf program. Detailed DC & AC 
transport and magnetization measurements were performed on Physical Property 
Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design). 
 
Results and discussion: 
 
 
The room temperature observed and Reitveld fitted XRD pattern of as synthesized 
NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1-0.9) samples are shown in Figure 1. All compounds are crystallized in 
tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm. Small impurity peaks of NdOF and Bi2S3 are 
also been observed, which are marked in Figure 1. It can be seen from the XRD pattern the 
(004) shifts towards the higher 2θ angle, suggesting the smaller c-axis constant. Reitveld 
analysis of XRD show that the lattice parameter c decreases from 13.509Å to 13.404Å as x is 
increased from x = 0.1 to 0.7 and the same again increases (c=13.406Å) for x=0.9. It seems 
the x = 0.7 is the solubility limit of F at O site in NdO1-xFxBiS2. Decrease in c parameter is 
clear indication of the fact, that the layer structure shrinks with successive O-2 site F-1 
substitution in the NdO1-xFxBiS2system. These results are in good agreement with the reported 
phase diagrams for NdO1-xFxBiS2, CeO1-xFxBiS2and PrO1-xFxBiS2compound [9, 15, 21].  
 
 
Figure 2 depict the DC magnetic susceptibility being performed in both ZFC (Zero 
Field Cool) and FC (Field Cool) protocols under the applied magnetic field 10Oe for the 
NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7) samples. Superconducting transitions for these measured 
samples are observed in terms of clear diamagnetic signals below their respective Tc. The 
strongest diamagnetic signal 4πχ in ZFC at 2K is near −1 for the NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. This 
shows that the shielding volume fraction for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample at 2K is almost 100%. 
The diamagnetic signal is also observed at below 2.3K for x = 0.1, 3.5K for x = 0.3, and 4.6K 
for x=0.5 samples with their respective shielding volume fractions of around 5%, 25%, and 
50% at 2K.  The NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample exhibits the maximum shielding volume fraction 
(~100%) with highest Tc of above 5K. The ac magnetization of maximum Tc sample 
NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 being measured at different ac field amplitudes (0.5-15 Oe) and fixed 


 
4
frequency of 333Hz with zero bias dc field is shown in Fig. 3. The ac magnetic susceptibility, 
confirms the bulk superconductivity at around 5K. It can be seen, that the height of imaginary 
part peak as well as diamagnetism in real part of ac susceptibility are increased monotonically 
with increase in amplitude. On the other hand the imaginary part peak position temperature 
(4K) is not changed with increasing ac amplitude, suggesting that the superconducting grains 
are well coupled in NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 superconductor.  
 
 
The normalized resistance (R/R300) vs temperature is shown in the Fig. 4 for the NdO1-
xFxBiS2 (x=0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) samples. The parent phase of NdO1-xFxBiS2 compound 
shows semimetal behavior in the temperature range of 300-2K. With successive doping of F-1 
at O-2 the superconductivity starts appearing in NdO1-xFxBiS2 compounds. The highest Tc 
above 5.25K is seen at the nominal concentration of x =0.7, and later Tc decrease for x=0.9. A 
superconducting onset transition is observed for all the F doped samples but for x=0.9, 
Tc(R=0) is not seen down to 2K. Inset of the Fig.4 shows the extended plot of R/R300 vs T 
from 2- 6K. it is clear that all the F doped samples show the Tc
onset, namely at 2.5K, 3.5K, 4K, 
4.8K and 5.25K for x=0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 0.5 and 0.7 respectively. Figure 5 shows the nominal x 
dependence of lattice parameter c (Å), and Tc
onset. It is clear that Tc of NdO1-xFxBiS2 increases 
with nominal Fluorine concentration (x) until x=0.7 along with a decrease in c lattice 
parameter.  One can say the Tc is highest for lowest c lattice parameter, probably as besides 
the carrier doping the chemical pressure is increasing with the concentration of the x till x = 
0.7. For x= 0.9 sample, the lattice constant is increased and the Tc
onset is decreased. Worth 
mentioning is the fact that Tc
onset values being seen from resistivity measurements (Fig.4) are 
slightly higher than the ones being determined from the magnetization measurements (Fig. 2 
and 3), this is precisely because the former is percolation path for current flow and the later is 
bulk property of a superconductor.  
 
 
Figure 6 (a), (b), and (c) show the temperature dependence of resistivity under applied 
magnetic field for three samples with x=0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 respectively. All the three samples 
shows relatively sharp superconducting transitions at Tc = 3.5K, 5.0K and 5.25K. With 
applied field, one can see that both the Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) shift towards the low temperature. 
The former one is controlled by the upper critical field of the individual grains in a 
superconductor, while the latter one is due to the weak links between the grains as well as the 
vortex flow behavior. To determine upper critical field, we have taken 90% of normalized 
resistivity of the onset point of the transition and the conventional one-band Werthamer–
Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation  (Hc2(0)=−0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc) is used to determine 
the  upper critical field [22]. Figure 7 shows the Hc2 versus T for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, 


 
5
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples. The solid lines represent the fitted Hc2(T) from 
WHH formula with respect to the experimentally observed data points. The values of Hc2 
WHH(0) are 0.9 T for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, 2.8T for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, and 3.3T for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2.   
The plots of temperature derivative of resistivity for the highest Tc compound 
NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 at various applied magnetic field are shown in Fig. 8. It is clear from Fig. 8 that 
the broadening of dρ/dT peak takes place with increase in applied magnetic field, which 
suggests that the superconducting onset is relatively affected less than the Tc (ρ=0) state. The 
temperature derivative of resistivity in superconducting transition region gives narrow intense 
maxima, centered at mid of Tc in zero field, indicating good percolation path of 
superconducting grains. In this plot we can clearly see single transition peak at every applied 
field, which is an indication towards the better grains coupling in this compound. The 
broadening of the resistive transitions in the ρ(T)H curve with increasing magnetic fields can 
be seen in terms of energy dissipation due to vortex motion [23]. The resistivity in broadened 
region is caused by the creep of vortices, which are thermally activated. The resistivity in 
TAFF regime of the flux creep is given by Arrhenius equation [24], 
ρ(T,B) = ρ0 exp[ - U0/kBT] 
Where, ρ0 is the field independent pre-exponential factor (here normal state resistance at 6K 
ρ6K is taken as ρ0), kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and U0 is TAFF activation energy. To 
reveal the origin of thermally activated ρ(T,B), we present the Arrhenius plots of 
representative low resistance data. The linear dependence of ln ρ vs. T-1 plot for 
NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample is shown in Fig. 9. The values of the activation energy in the magnetic 
field range 0.02 to 2T are estimated from 62.66meV to 0.12meV.   
 
 
Figure 10 represent the Hall Effect measurements of superconducting NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 
sample. The Hall Effect measurement is performed to demonstrate the strange normal state 
behavior and obtain some useful properties such as suggested charge density wave instability 
in this compound [25]. The Hall coefficient (RH) of NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample is measured under 
1T applied magnetic field in the temperature range 2 to 300K. We observed the negative RH 
signal for the given temperature range, which suggest that the electrons are the dominating 
charge carriers in this system, same as for Fe based superconductors [26].   Inset of the Fig 10 
shows magnetic field dependence of Hall resistivity (ρxy), which is measured with magnetic 
field being perpendicular to the current and surface of the sample. The voltage Vxy is recorded 
across the direction of sample width. The sign of Hall resistivity ρxy at various temperatures 
of 2K, 10K, 50K, 100K, 200K and 300K of the studied NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample remains 
negative. Here we can see that the field dependence ρxy exhibits curved feature at 2K and for 


 
6
higher temperatures resistivity is linearly field dependent and remains negative. The curved 
feature at 2K happens due to the fact that the compound is superconducting at this 
temperature below its upper critical field. The single-band assumption is used to estimate the 
charge-carrier densit. As the ρxy exhibits linear behavior with the magnetic field, the RH can 
be measured by RH = dρxy/dH = 1/ne, for a single band metal, where n is the charge carrier 
density. For the single band assumption we estimate the charge carrier density of about 1.278 
× 1019/cm3 at 10K.   
 
 
Conclusion: 
 
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized BiS2-based superconductor NdO1-xFxBiS2 
(x=0.1-0.9) by solid state vacuum encapsulation technique. Reitveld refinement of XRD 
pattern show that all the samples are crystallized in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group and the 
lattice parameters decrease with the F-doping. The bulk superconductivity with maximum Tc 
of 5.25K and nearly 100% shielding volume fraction at 2K is seen for nominal x=0.7. 
Electrical resistivity measurements showed that under applied magnetic field both Tc onset 
and Tc (ρ =0) decrease to lower temperatures and an upper critical field Hc2(0) of above 
3Tesla is estimated for NdO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. The activation energy in the magnetic field 
range 0.02 to 2Tesla has been estimated from 62.66meV to 0.12meV. Hall measurement 
results indicated dominance of electron charge carriers in this compound.
