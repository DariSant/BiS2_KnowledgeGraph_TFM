Abstract 
Single crystals of La(O,F)BiSSe were grown by using a CsCl flux method. Single crystal X-ray 
structural analysis reveals that the crystal structure is isostructural to the BiS2- or BiSe2-based 
compounds crystallizing with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1110(2) Å, c = 13.6010(7) 
Å). However, the S atoms are selectively occupied at the apical site of the Bi-SSe pyramids in the 
superconducting layer. The single crystals show a superconducting transition at around 4.2 K in the 
magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements. The superconducting anisotropic parameter is 
determined to be 34-35 from its upper critical magnetic field. The anisotropy is in the same range with 
that of other members of the La(O,F)BiCh2 (Ch = S, Se) family under ambient pressure.

After the discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3,1 various kinds of BiS2-based superconductors have 
been developed, such as the Ln(O,F)BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb),2-7 (La,M)OBiS2 (M = Th, Hf, Zr, 
Ti),8 (Sr,La)FBiS2 families.9 They crystallize with a layered structure which is composed of 
superconducting BiS2 layers and charge reservoir blocking layers similar to which is found for the 
cuprate or Fe-based superconductors.  
 
La(O,F)BiS2 is a typical BiS2-based superconductor and comprises of the blocking layer 
La(O,F) as shown in Figure 1. The same blocking layer is also present for the Fe-based superconductor 
La(O,F)FeAs.10 Recently, the modification of the superconducting layer has been explored in an attempt 
to design a new type of superconductor. The superconducting layer can be modified by changing the S 
atoms to Se. Polycrystalline samples of La(O,F)BiSSe (Tc ~3.8 K)11 and La(O,F)BiSe2 (Tc ~2.6 K)12 
have been reported. Among the Se-substituted system of La(O0.5F0.5)Bi(S,Se)2, the materials start to 
exhibit metallic behavior and Tc shows its highest value at a ratio of S:Se = 1:1.13 It is interesting to 
know why Tc shows the highest value at the stoichiometric ideal of La(O,F)BiSSe. Single crystals of the 
end members La(O,F)BiS2 and La(O,F)BiSe2 have been prepared and the crystal structures were 
carefully determined using single crystal X-ray structural analysis.14, 15 It is important to compare the 
single crystal structure of La(O,F)BiSSe to that of the end members so as to help design a new 
compound with a higher Tc.

In this study, we have prepared single crystals of La(O,F)BiSSe by a CsCl flux method and 
carried out various characteristic measurements including single crystal X-ray diffraction. Here, we 
discuss the bonding nature and superconducting properties of this compound.

Single crystals of La(O,F)BiSSe were prepared by an alkali metal chloride flux method similar 
to that of La(O,F)BiSe2.15 The synthesis details are described in the Supplementary Information.16 Single 
crystal X-ray structural analysis was carried out using a Rigaku AFC11 Saturn CCD diffractometer with 
a VariMax confocal X-ray optical system for Mo K radiation ( = 0.71073 Å). Prior to the diffraction 
experiment, the crystals were cooled to 113 K in a cold N2 gas flow, in order to suppress the thermal 
displacement factors. Cell refinement and data reduction were carried out by the program d*trek 
package in CrystalClear software suite.17 The structure was solved by the direct method using 
SHELXS,18 and was refined with the program SHELXL18 in the WinGX software package.19 
Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra were observed using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL, 
JSM-6010LA). The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured using a SQUID 
magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) down to 1.8 K under a field of 10 Oe, and the field was 
applied parallel to the c-axis. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was measured down to 
2.0 K, with a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) using a standard 
four-probe method with constant current mode. The electrodes were attached in the ab-plane with silver 
paste.  
 
Both the spot and overall EDX analysis measurements on the sample surface showed almost 
the same composition. The averaged compositional ratio of elements is estimated to be La : Bi : S : Se :

O : F = 1 : 0.95(8) : 0.92(13) : 0.9(2) : 0.32(4) : 0.19(2), in which the ratio was based on La = 1. The 
atomic ratio except for O and F elements is in good agreement with the nominal composition 
(LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe), suggesting that the single crystal has the composition La(O,F)BiSSe.  
 
The obtained crystals are highly oriented along the c-axis (Fig.S1).16 The X-ray single crystal 
refinement converged to the R1 values of 3.66 % and 4.37 % for I ≥ 2(I) and all data, respectively, for 
16 variables including anisotropic parameters. The atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are 
given in TABLE I. The compound crystallizes with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 
4.1102(2) Å, c = 13.6010(7) Å, and Z = 1). The crystal has an alternate stacking of BiSSe pyramids and 
La2(O/F)2 layers; the basic structure of this crystal is isostructural with La(O,F)BiS2 and La(O,F)BiSe2.14, 
15 All atoms were located at special positions and their anisotropic displacement factors were all positive 
and within similar ranges, all of which appeared to be physically reasonable. Since the occupancy 
refinement in O and F under constrain of Occ.(O) + Occ.(F) = 1 did not converge in the refinement, the 
occupancies were fixed to the nominal composition, O:F = 0.5:0.5.

Interestingly, the apical Ch1 site of the Bi-SSe pyramid is selectively occupied by S. It is 
reasonable to presume that a small amount of Se in Ch1 site is attributed to a migration of excess Se 
caused by the non-stoichiometry of the crystal. Namely, S and Se atoms are separately ordered in 
different sites in an ideal stoichiometric crystal as shown in Figure 2(a). This site selectivity suggests the 
possibility for designing a new superconducting layer by replacing the Ch1 and Ch2 atoms selectively.  
 
Some selected bond distances and angles are given in Fig. 2(b) as the ORTEP representation 
and Table II in comparison with those of other structural analysis results on La(O,F)BiCh2.14,15 Six 
coordinated Bi atoms are bonded with S and/or Se atoms in three kinds such as Bi-Ch1, in-plane Bi-Ch2, 
and inter-plane Bi-Ch2 bondings. Focusing on the Bi-Ch1 bond, we can see a remarkable feature 
reflecting the site selectivity. As can be seen from TABLE II, for the two different samples with 
determined F-content, La(O0.77F0.23)BiS2 and La(O0.54F0.46)BiS2, respectively,14 the Bi-Ch1 bonding

length is almost the same value (with a 0.8 % difference in value). The distance also does not change so 
much when varying the chalcogen atoms from La(O,F)BiS2 to La(O,F)BiSSe. However, it jumps up to 
more than 6 % when moving from La(O,F)BiSSe to La(O,F)BiSe2. The difference of ~0.14 Å is 
identical to the difference between the ionic radii S2- (1.84 Å) and Se2- (1.98 Å).20 This fact indicates that 
the in-plane Ch2 sites are selectively replaced by Se atoms rather than at the apical Ch1 sites. This 
tendency is reflected when the change in the c-lattice constant is plotted against increasing Se-content in 
the polycrystalline sample.13 At a ratio of S:Se = 1:1 and beyond, there is a clear increase in the gradient 
of the slope. An observation that is not present in the case of a-axis.  
 
Bond valence sum (BVS) was estimated from the observed bond distances and the BVS 
parameters (r0 and B values) of nominal valence La3+, Bi3+, S2-, Se2-, O2-, F- provided by Brown.21 The 
BVS values are also listed in TABLE I. The BVS of Bi was estimated to be +3.36, indicating a 
difference of +0.36 from nominal valence. This result suggests the charge neutrality of this compound 
should be kept by modification of valence state of Bi as has been shown for the X-ray photoemission 
spectroscopy results for the BiS2-based compound.22

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for a single crystal 
of La(O,F)BiSSe. The diamagnetic signal corresponds to superconductivity which appears below 4.1 K. 
The shielding and Meissner volume fraction at 1.8 K were estimated to be ~130 % and ~62 %, 
respectively. Since the magnetic field was applied parallel to c-axis in the plate-like shaped sample, the 
superconducting fraction includes overestimation due to its demagnetization effect.   
 
Figure 4 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity along the ab-plane in the single 
crystal. The resistivity shows metallic behavior above 7 K, and it deviates from the linear extrapolation 
of the normal part at around 5.0 K. Then it shows a sharp drop at around 4.2 K, and zero resistivity at 
around 3.7 K (Tc
zero), corresponding to the superconducting transition temperature Tc found in the 
magnetic susceptibility measurement as shown in the inset. The onset temperature of superconductivity 
(Tc
onset) was determined to the temperature at 95 % of resistivity in its normal conduction state. The Tc is 
clearly higher than that of the polycrystalline sample (Tc ~ 3.8 K). This tendency is also observed in 
La(O,F)BiSe2.15 It is likely that the high crystallinity is a factor in the observed Tc for Bi-Ch2 based 
superconductors, although the reason why is unclear.

The resistivity was measured under various magnetic fields along the ab-plane (H//ab) and the 
c-axis (H//c) as shown in Figure 5(a) and (b), respectively. The superconductivity is significantly 
suppressed with increasing field parallel to c-axis in comparison to that in the case of ab-plane. Figure 6 
shows the temperature dependence of the upper critical field (Hc2(T)), which was plotted from the values 
of Tc
onset in Fig. 5. The Hc2(0) in H//ab and H//c were estimated to be Hc2
//ab(0) = 24.3 and Hc2
//c(0) = 0.7 
T, respectively, from the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) approximation for the Type II 
superconductor in a dirty limit. The linear extrapolation of Tc
onset lead to Hc2
//ab(0) = 37.4 T and Hc2
//c(0) 
= 1.1 T. From these results, the superconducting anisotropic parameter  = Hc2
//ab(0) / Hc2
//c(0) is 
determined to be 34-35. The  of La(O,F)BiS2 varies from 35 to 45 depending on its fluorine content.23 
In case of La(O,F)BiSe2, the  value was reported to 20-49.24, 25  = 34-35 determined in this study is 
almost the same value with those of the other La(O,F)BiCh2 superconductors.

Note that the Tc is clearly higher than that of La(O,F)BiS2 (Tc = 2.6 K)2, 14 and La(O,F)BiSe2 
(Tc = 3.6 K).12, 15 The relatively higher Tc is attributed to the arrangement of apical S and in-plane Se for 
the Bi-SSe pyramids, which may enhance the density of states at the Fermi level. Theoretical studies are 
required to know the reason for the enhancement in Tc. And further to this, there is a possibility to 
achieve a higher Tc by applying high pressure to La(O,F)BiSSe in a fashion analogous to that which has 
already been applied to other BiSe2- or BiS2-based materials.25-27 This also should be investigated in 
future works.  
 
In conclusion, single crystals of La(O,F)BiSSe have been prepared using the CsCl flux method. 
La(O,F)BiSSe crystalized with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1110(2) Å, c = 13.6010(7) 
Å). The single crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that the apical site of the Bi-SSe pyramid in the 
superconducting layer is selectively occupied by S atoms. The magnetic susceptibility and resistivity 
measurements showed a clear superconducting transition at around 4.2 K. The superconducting 
anisotropic parameter was determined to be 34-35 from its upper critical magnetic field.
