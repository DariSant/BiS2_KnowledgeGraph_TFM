Abstract 
We review theoretical aspects of the studies on the recently discovered BiCh2 
(Ch=chalcogen) based superconductors. We first focus on the electronic band structure, 
the Fermi surface and their correlation with the lattice structure. We then discuss the 
phonon features and the issue of the lattice instability. Finally, we survey the 
phonon-mediated as well as the unconventional pairing mechanisms that have been 
proposed so far. 
 
1. Introduction 
Ever since the discovery of high Tc superconductivity in the cuprates, a number of 
interesting superconductors possessing layered structure have been found. Among them 
are the organic superconductors [1,2], MgB2 [3,4], Sr2RuO4 [5,6], NaxCoO2 [7,8], 
(Hf,Zr)NCl [9-11], and the iron-based superconductors [12,13]. Theoretically, the 
pairing mechanism and/or the pairing symmetry of these materials have been of great 
interest, and in order to clarify these issues, it is important to understand the electronic 
as well as the phonon features. Among these materials, the cuprates and the iron-based 
superconductors share a commonality in that they consist of conducting and insulating 
blocking layers, and many different materials can be synthesized by varying the 
blocking layer. In this regard, the newly discovered BiCh2 (Ch: chalcogen) based 
superconductors form another group of layered materials with various kinds of blocking 
layers [14,15]. Mizuguchi et al. first discovered in 2012 Bi4O4S3 with Tc = 8.6 K [16]. 
Bi4O4S3 has a layered structure consisting of BiS2, SO4 and BiO layers, and it was 
revealed from the first principles band calculation that the BiS2 layer is the conducting 
layer. BiS2 layers take a bi-pyramidal lattice structure reminiscent of those in some of 
the cuprate superconductors consisting of CuO pyramids [17]. After the discovery of 
Bi4O4S3, LaOBiS2 was immediately discovered [18]. This material has the same BiS2 
layers, but the blocking layer consists of LaO, which has the same structure as the in the 
iron based superconductor LaFeAsO [12]. Many materials have been found by 
substituting the lanthanide, e.g. CeOBiS2 [19], PrOBiS2 [20], NdOBiS2 [21], 


SrFBiS2[22] and other materials [23-24]. Recently, bismuth selenide LaOBiSe2 has also 
been found to show superconducting properties similar to the sulfides [25]. These 
materials are often referred to as the 1112 systems.  
Superconductivity appears by doping electrons into the BiS2 layers. In Bi4O4S3, the 
electron doping is accomplished by controlling the amount of SO4 molecules as (SO4)1-x. 
It has been found that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is metallic, while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) is a band 
insulator [16,26]. In the 1112 materials REOBi(S,Se)2 (RE=rare earth), electron doping 
is realized by substituting fluorine for oxygen in the same way as in the iron based 
superconductors. Superconducting transition temperature Tc is maximized at the 
fluorine doping level of x = 0.5 and the maximum Tc exceeds 10K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[27]. Chalcogen S can also be replaced by Se, which gives LaOBiSe2 with Tc = 2.6 K 
[25]. In this article, we give a review on the theoretical aspects of the studies on BiCh2 
based superconductors. Features of the crystal structures, band structures, phonon 
dispersions and candidates for the superconducting pairing mechanism will be discussed. 
 
2. The crystal structure and band structure  
2.1 Crystal structure

The crystal structure of BiCh2 based superconductors consists of the Bi-Ch2 bilayers 
and the blocking layers. The crystal structures Bi4O4S3 and LaOBiS2 are shown in Fig.1 
(a) and (b), respectively.  Here, we will focus only on the 1112 system. LaOBiS2 has a 
tetragonal lattice structure belonging to the P4/nmm space group, with the lattice 
constants a = 4.04 Å and c = 13.8Å [28]. The BiS2 bilayers have a pyramidal type 
structure consisting of the BiS plane and the apical S atoms, which is reminiscent of the 
bi-layer cuprates consisting of CuO pyramids [17]. The BiS plane exhibits a 
two-dimensional square lattice, as shown in Fig. 1(c). The BiS plane is not perfectly flat, 
and the atoms are buckled to some extent. The Bi-Ch-Bi bond angle, namely the 
strength of the buckling, is governed by the blocking layer [29] and also the amount of 
fluorine doping [30].  
The lattice structure can also be determined by theoretical optimization[31-34]. These 
results indicate that the effect of the fluorine doping on the crystal structure is to 
increase the lattice constant a and reduce the lattice constant c, and in total to reduce the 
unit cell volume. From the first principles calculations [31,32], it is shown that the BiS 
plane is flattened as the fluorine content increases from x = 0 to 0.5. On the other hand, 
at x = 1 the buckling of the BiS plane increases again. Therefore, not only the blocking 
layer, but also the amount of the electron doping controls the conduction layer. As will 
be discussed in section 2.3, theoretical studies have predicted dynamical or static lattice 
distortions [31-33]. Local distortion of Bi-S bond length has also been observed 
experimentally [35]. 
 
2.2 Electronic band structure 
The band structure of BiCh2 based superconductors has been obtained by first 
principles band calculations [16, 31-34, 36-41]. The band structures of Bi4O4S3 and 
LaOBiS2 calculated without spin orbit coupling are shown in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), 
respectively [16,36]. For Bi4O4S3, the radii of the circles in Fig. 2(a) shows the strength 
of the Bi 6p orbital character. The orbital character of the band structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 
(x = 0, 0.5 and 1) is shown in Fig. 3 [32]. The common feature of the band structure is 
that the conduction bands consist of the antibonding states of the Bi 6p and S 3p orbitals 
(mainly Bi 6p orbitals).  In LaOBiS2, there are four conduction bands mainly 
composed of the Bi px and py orbitals, while in Bi4O4S3, there are also other bands 
originating from other layers that contribute to the conductivity. We shall see later that 
the hopping integrals between the Bi 6 px and py orbitals are small, so that the 
conduction bands actually possesses one dimensional nature in spite of the apparently 
two dimensional feature of the crystal structure (see the modeling part in the latter part 


of this section). Due to the strong Bi-S hybridization, the valence bands have S 3px, 3py 
character mixed with Bi 6p, but we can see in Fig.3(a) that the valence bands just below 
the Fermi level around the  point do not have Bi 6px/y nor S 3px/y character for the 
mother compound (x = 0), which is because the origin of these bands is the blocking 
layers and the S 3pz orbitals.  
The conduction bands exhibit two-fold degeneracy along kx =  or ky =  (along 
X-M) due to the P4/nmm symmetry of the 1112 system. In Bi4O4S3, this two-fold 
degeneracy is lifted because of the I4/mmm symmetry [16].  Even in the 1112 systems, 
the degeneracy is lifted along the X- line, and this splitting reflects the magnitude of 
the hopping integral between the two layers within the Bi-Ch2 bilayer structure (i.e., 
bilayer splitting). The splitting is small within the conduction bands because px and py 
orbitals of different layers barely overlap [36]. 
 
 
Fig. 2 The band structure of (a) Bi4O4S3 [16] and (b) LaOBiS2 [36]. 
 
As mentioned in subsection 2.1, the lattice constants and the internal coordinates vary 
with fluorine doping. The fluorine doping affects the band gap, band width and the 
details of the band structure. It can be seen from Fig.3 that the conduction bands around 
the  point shift downwards with respect to other bands as the fluorine is doped, and 
these bands eventually cross the Fermi energy (Fig. 3 (c)). Therefore, the number of 
Fermi surfaces is expected to increase when x becomes close to 1, but such a large 
amount of doping is not realized in actual materials. Hence, within the realistic doping 
range, the rigid band picture is valid around the Fermi energy.  
In Fig.4, the Fermi surface evolution of LaOBiS2 is displayed, which was obtained 


within a rigid band approximation by varying the electron doping rate from x = 0.2 to 
0.7 [37]. For all doping rates, the Fermi surface exhibits very weak three dimensionality, 
reflecting the layered crystal structure as well as the in-plane nature of the px, py orbitals 
of the conduction bands. This is actually consistent with experimental observations on 
single crystals suggesting strong anisotropy of the conductivity[42]. The Fermi surfaces 
that appear around (,0) and (0,) are almost two-fold degenerate, where the splitting of 
the Fermi surface occurs due to the hoppings between the two BiS layers within the 
bilayer structure, i.e, the bilayer splitting. The density of states at the Fermi energy is 
maximized at around x = 0.5 because of the Lifshitz transition of the Fermi surface. For 
x > 0.5, the shape of the Fermi surface appears to be two dimensional as in the curates 
[43], but the orbital component of the Fermi surface possesses one dimensional 
character more like in Sr2RuO4 [44]. Note, however, that the band filling of Sr2RuO4 is 
around 1.33 per band on average, while that of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is one-eighth filled per 
band.

(b) 0.5, and (c) 1] [32]. 
 
 
Fig. 4 The Fermi surface of LaO1-xFxBiS2 without spin orbit coupling [37]. 
 
As far as the Fermi surface is concerned, the rigid band picture works well. However, 
the band gap itself is largely affected by fluorine doping, which can also be seen in 
Fig.3. For the non-doped material, the band gap is an indirect one between the band 
originating from Bi p orbitals at the X point and that originating from the O p orbitals at 
the  point. On the other hand, for x = 0.5, the band gap becomes a direct one between 
the bands at the X point coming mainly from Bi p and S p orbitals within the BiS plane. 
 The indirect gap can be controlled by the onsite energy of O p orbitals, which in turn 
is affected by the relative position between La and O in the blocking layer. The band 
structure assuming  hypothetical lattice structure of LaOBiS2 was calculated in ref. 
[39] as shown in Fig. 5, where the bond length between La and apical S atoms was 
varied. The indirect band gap increases upon increasing the bond length, namely, 
decreasing the onsite energy of the oxygen. The substitution of fluorine for oxygen also 
decreases the oxygen (fluorine) onsite energy. On the other hand, the direct band gap is 


controlled by the Bi-Ch intralayer hopping. When the Bi-Ch bond length becomes small 
by reducing the lattice constant a, the direct band gap decreases because the band width 
increases. The size of the band gap is also affected by the Bi-Ch-Bi bond angle, which 
controls the overlap of the Bi and Ch orbitals, and hence the hopping integral of the 
conduction bands.

3.83 Å. [39] 
 
  So far we have seen the band structures calculated without spin-orbit coupling, but 
the Bi atom is generally known to have strong spin-orbit coupling effects. Fig.6 shows 
the comparison of the band structure and the Fermi surface calculated with and without 
taking into account the spin-orbit coupling [31]. With the spin-orbit coupling included, 
the band gap becomes small, and also the band splitting around the X point increases 
because the hopping integral between Bi-Ch layers within the bilayer structure increases. 
Hence, the bilayer splitting of the Fermi surface also increases with spin-orbit coupling.

the lower panel) and without spin-orbit coupling. [31]. 
 
We will now compare the calculation results with some experimental data. In Fig.7, 
we show the comparison between the first principles band calculation and the angle 
resolved photoemission (ARPES) result for LaO1-xFxBiS2 with x ~ 0.5 [45]. At a glance, 
the agreement between experiment and theory looks good. The band width is nicely 
reproduced by the bare LDA calculation results, showing that the electron correlation 
effects are not so strong like in the 3d systems such as the cuprates and the iron-based 
superconductors. Similar agreement between ARPES and the band calculation has also 
been found in ref.[46]. To be precise, however, there seems to exist some discrepancies 
between the theory and the experiment. For instance, in cuts (e) and (f) of Fig. 7(d), the 
theoretical expectation seems to be different from the experiment. Also, the ARPES 
Fermi surfaces of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Fig.8) [47] and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 [48] are found to be 
much smaller than the theoretical expectation of 50% fluorine doped compounds. In fact, 


the observed Fermi surface resembles that of the first principles band calculation 
assuming less than 20% doping. There may be some reason for the effective number of 
doped electrons to be much smaller than the nominal value.

comparison of the band structure near EF between the photoemission data and the first

  It is interesting to compare the electronic band features of BiCh2 based 
superconductors to those of other bismuth based materials such as BaBiO3 [49-51] or 
Bi2Se3 [52, 53]. (Ba,K)(Bi,Pb)O3 becomes a superconductor with relatively high Tc [51] 
and Bi2Se3 is famous as a topological insulator with a possibility of becoming a  
topological superconductor when doped with Cu [54, 55]. In BaBiO3, the bands near the 
Fermi level originate from the Bi 6s orbital, so that the Fermi surface has a three 
dimensional shape [56]. In the case of Bi2Se3, the orbital character of the conduction 
bands is mainly 6p as in the BiCh2 based compound, but the band structure exhibits 
strong three dimensionality [57]. 
We now move on to the modeling of the electronic structure [36]. As mentioned 
above, the band structure around the band gap is constructed from O, Bi, Ch p orbitals, 
and the conduction bands mainly consist of the Bi 6px and 6py orbitals, which are 
strongly mixed with the S 3px and 3py orbitals. Due to the bilayer lattice structure, an 
eight-orbital model can be considered as suitable for describing the conduction states. 
The model can be further simplified by considering the fact that the hopping integral 
between the two layers within the bilayer structure is small due to the strong in-plane 
character of the px/y orbitals. Then, adopting a single layer approximation, we can 
construct a four-orbital model originating from Bi 6 px/y and S 3 px/y orbitals as shown in 
Fig. 9(a). Finally, considering only the conduction bands, we can construct a two-orbital 
model as shown in Fig.9(b). This two-orbital model has been widely used for theoretical 
studies of unconventional pairing by adding the electron-electron interaction and/or the 
spin-orbit coupling terms [58-67]. 
 
 
Fig. 9 The band structure of (a) the effective two-orbital,  (b) the four-orbital models, 
and (c) the tightbinding model of the BiS plane [36]. 


 
In order to discuss the magnitude of the hopping integrals, we adopt the pX and pY 
orbitals, where the X-Y axes are rotated by 45° (see Fig. 9(c)) [36]. This is because the 
largest hopping integral is along the Bi-S bonding direction, namely, the X and Y axes. 
The two orbital model mainly consists of the nearest and the next nearest neighbor 
intraorbital hoppings t and t’, and the nearest neighbor interorbital hopping tXY (Fig. 
9(c)). The values are t=-0.167, t’= 0.88 and tXY = 0.107eV for LaOBiS2 [36]. The 
mixture between the pX and pY orbitals (tXY) is relatively small, and this mixing controls 
the two dimensionality of the system. The Fermi surface at a fluorine doping ratio of x = 
0.2 in Fig. 4 exhibits a two dimensional feature due to this pX-pY mixing. 
Although this two-orbital model almost perfectly reproduces the band structure and 
the Fermi surface of the first principles calculation, the hopping integral between the 
Bi-Ch layers should be included if the effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the band 
structure is taken into account. The spin-orbit coupling slightly increases the bilayer 
splitting of the Fermi surface [31]. Then, the four-orbital (conduction bands only) or the 
eight-orbital (conduction and valence bands) models are more suitable for describing 
the effect of the mixture of the orbitals between the layers. 
 
2.3 Phonon features  
The phonon dispersion has been calculated for LaOBiS2 [31-33] and LaOBiSe2 [34]. 
In the left panel of Fig.10, we show the phonon dispersion calculated in ref.[33] for the 
P4/nmm lattice structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 at x = 0 and 0.5 using a 4 × 4 × 1 supercell. 
Negative energy, hence unstable, phonon modes are seen for both doping levels. 
The phonon modes at  and M points can be divided into 6B2, 10E and 4A1 at  point 
and 4B1, 4A1, 5B2 5A2 and 6E at M point [32]. At x = 0, the orthorhombic P21mn 
symmetry is the most stable structure due to the E mode at , where the S atoms move 
towards Bi atoms along the a or b axis [33]. The total energy of this structure is ~1 meV 
smaller than that of the original lattice structure as shown in the right panel of Fig.10. 
The potential energy is therefore very shallow, so that the tetragonal lattice structure 
should be observed because of the quantum fluctuations, in agreement with the actual 
experiments.

Fig. 11 Calculated double well potential for the frozen phonon mode as a function of the 
displacement from the symmetric point in the tetragonal structure, along with the 
probability of the ground state atomic wave function [31].  
 
  At x = 0.5, the unstable mode is present at the M point, namely the wave vector  
The potential energy against the distortion corresponding to the lowest phonon mode 
has a much deeper local minimum compared to the distortion for x = 0. In ref.[33], 


energy levels that are bound to this local minimum were obtained (Fig.10 right panel), 
while in ref. [31], the obtained energy levels were unbound (Figs. 11), so that the system 
should appear as tetragonal. In any case, the system is close to the border between 
dynamically or statically distorted lattice structure. 
The origin of the unstable modes for x = 0 and 0.5 is different. In ref. [33], it has been 
suggested that the ferroelectric unstable mode at x = 0 occurs due to the mismatch of the 
optimum lattice constants between LaO and BiS2 layers. This was confirmed by 
recalculating the phonon dispersion with a smaller lattice constant a (a = 3.8Å), for 
which the soft phonon mode was not obtained. On the other hand, at x = 0.5, it was 
shown that taking a smaller lattice constant does not stabilize the negative energy 
phonons.  
Actually, the unstable mode at x = 0.5 is more related to the Fermi surface nesting. In 
ref.[33], it was shown that this unstable phonon mode actually spreads along the -M 
line. The relation between this and the Fermi surface nesting can be clearly seen in the 
two orbital model described in subsection 2.2. The largest eigenvalue of the irreducible 
susceptibility of the two-orbital model at x=0.5 is shown in Fig. 12(a) [36]. The 
diagonal structures that go through (0,0) or (,) are due to the Fermi surface nesting 
shown by the arrows in Fig. 12 (b). Along the (q,q,0) line, the irreducible susceptibility 
is enhanced because of the one dimensional nature of the pX and pY orbitals. Hence, the 
unstable phonon dispersion along -M reflects the unstable nature of the electronic 
system along this line, which implies a strong electron phonon coupling.

The phonon features of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 are basically similar to that of the sulfur 
counterpart [34]. However, the potential energy minimum of the  distortion is 
much shallower. In the case of the selenide, it is unlikely that the distortion is statically 
stabilized.  
 
3. Superconductivity 
The pairing mechanism of the BiCh2 based superconductors is still under debate. In 
this section, we will discuss some of the pairing mechanism candidates.  
 
3.1 Expriemental results  
  First, we briefly summarize some of the experimental results. It has experimentally 
been found that Tc of LaO1-xFxBiS2 is maximized at x = 0.5 [27]. The maximum Tc at 
around x = 0.5 has also been observed in other 1112 systems. Tc is also dependent on the 
lattice parameters within the 1112 systems. This may be expected because different rare 
earth blocking layer gives slight difference in the lattice constants as well as the 
buckling within the BiCh planes. Quite recently, it has been shown that Tc is 
systematically correlated with the chemical pressure, which has been quantitatively 
defined as the in-plane distance between Bi and Ch atoms normalized by the summation 
of their ionic radii [68]. 
   As for the pairing symmetry, experimental results have suggested the fully gaped 
state, which is consistent with s-wave pairing [69-72]. For example, the penetration 
depth measurements indicate that the superfluid density can be fit by theoretical 
calculations assuming multiple s-wave gaps [69-71]. Strong coupling superconductivity 
has been indicated in a number of studies, but the value of 2/kBTc varies among 
various measurements ; for instance, very large values such as 7.2 for Bi4O4S3 
(penetration depth measurement) [69] and 16.8 for Nd(O,F)BiS2 (scanning tunneling 
spectroscopy) [73] was reported, while the above mentioned penetration depth 
measurement for Nd(O,F)BiS2 observed  2/kBTc ~4 [71]. 
 
3.2 Phonon mediated pairing 
The possibility of phonon-mediated pairing has been investigated from the early stage 
of the theoretical studies [31-34]. Based on the first principles calculation results, Tc can 
be estimated using the Allen-Dynes formula [74, 75], 𝑇c =
𝜔ln
1.2 exp [−
1.04(1+𝜆)
𝜆−𝜇∗(1+0.62)𝜆] , 
where is the electron-phonon coupling, * is the screened Coulomb interaction 
parameter, and ln is the logarithmically averaged phonon frequency. The electron 


phonon coupling  can be calculated as λ = 2 ∫
𝛼2𝐹(𝐸)
𝐸
𝑑𝐸
𝜔
0
, where 2F is the 
Eliashberg function. In all of the calculations, the electron-phonon coupling is estimated 
to be large. For the tetragonal lattice structure, = 0.85 was obtained for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[31] and = 0.51 [34] for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. The difference comes from the contribution 
of the anharmonic, unstable phonons, for which the sulfide has a deeper potential 
minimum and a larger distortion. These calculations give Tc = 9~11K for La(O,F)BiS2 
[31-33] and Tc ~ 2.4 K for La(O,F)BiSe2 [34], assuming * = 0.1. 
In ref.[33], the electron-phonon coupling was calculated for two distorted lattice 
structures of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, namely,  = 0.83 for the (,) optimized phase and  = 0.6 
for the CDW phase [33]. The phonon density of states, the Eliashberg function 2F and 
the electron-phonon coupling constant  calculated in ref. [33] are shown in Fig. 13.  
 
 
Fig. 13 The phonon density of states, the Eliashberg function 2F along with  the 
electron-phonon coupling constant  (dashed lines) calculated for the two distorted 
lattice structures of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [33]. 
 
In both phases, the Eliashberg function 2F exhibits similar features. The electron 
phonon spectral function is large in the low frequency regime around several meV, and 
also in the intermediate frequency regime around 20 meV. The phonon density of states 
shows that the low frequency modes originate from Bi (and La) vibrations, while the 
intermediate frequency modes around 20 meV are from S vibrations. According to ref. 
[32], one of the low frequency phonon modes is the A1 mode, which corresponds to the 
vertical vibrations with the upper and lower BiS2 layers moving in the opposite 


direction, and two of the intermediate frequency modes are the E and B2 modes. In the E 
mode, LaO and BiS2 layers move toward the x or y axis. In the B2 mode, La, Bi and 
in-plane S atoms move along the same vertical direction, while the apical S in the BiS2 
plane and O atoms move in the opposite directions of La, Bi and in-plane S atoms. 
The large electron-phonon couplings obtained for BiCh2 based superconductors are 
comparable to that of MgB2 [3,4], which has the highest Tc among conventional 
superconductors at ambient pressure. Within the phonon-mediated pairing scenario, the 
reason why Tc of the BiCh2 based superconductors is much lower than that of MgB2 is 
because of the small logarithmic phonon frequency average. The logarithmic frequency 
average is 100~260K for LaOBiS2 [31-33], while estimations for MgB2 have given  = 
540K [76] and 700K [77] . 
These calculated Tc values appear to be in good agreement with the experimental 
observations (few K ~ 10K), and the phonon-mediated s-wave state is consistent with 
the experiments mentioned in the beginning of this section. Nonetheless, there are some 
controversies regarding the strong electron-phonon coupling scenario. For instance, a 
Raman scattering experiment estimates the electron-phonon coupling to be large, 
consistent with the theories [72], while another Raman experiment, with different kind 
of analysis, gives a smaller estimation, suggesting unconventional pairing [78]. Also, 
applying chemical [68,79,80] or physical pressure [81-83] gives rise to enhancement of 
Tc, but this may be in contradiction with a simple BCS expectation because the 
application of pressure should reduce the density of states. Moreover, a neutron 
scattering study of La(O,F)BiS2 has shown that the phonon modes are not affected by 
the normal to superconducting transition, in contradiction to the theoretical expectation 
of a strong electron-phonon coupling superconductor [84]. One should also note that the 
theoretical estimations of strong electron-phonon coupling have been obtained for the 
fluorine content of x=0.5, where the Fermi surface nesting is good and the Fermi level 
sits at the peak of the electronic density of states, but the ARPES experiments for 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Fig.8) [47] and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 [48] suggest that the effective electron 
doping rate is much smaller than that expected for x = 0.5, as mentioned previously. In 
fact, the Sommerfeld coefficient of the specific heat  is estimated to be smaller (less 
than 2.5mJ/mol K2) than the theoretical estimation for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (3mJ/molK2) [15] 
suggesting both smaller carrier concentration and weak electron-phonon coupling. 
 
 
3.3 Unconventional pairing mechanisms 
Unconventional pairing mechanisms have also been proposed for the BiCh2 based 


superconductors. Several studies have examined the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing 
scenario [36,61,64,67]. If one assumes a short range (e.g., on-site only) interaction, 
strong spin fluctuation may arise due to the Fermi surface nesting. Applying the random 
phase approximation to the two-orbital model of Bi 6px, py orbitals (in which the 
spin-orbit coupling is omitted), the competition among extended s, dxy, dx2-y2, and 
g-wave pairings have been discussed [36,61,64,67]. Fig.14 shows the calculation result 
of ref. [64]. Here, the eigenvalue  of the Eliashberg equation is a qualitative measure of 
the superconducting transition temperature (note that here is not the electron-phonon 
coupling constant). In the small doping regime around x = 0.14, the g-wave (A2g) 
symmetry is dominant. However, in the strong Hund’s coupling regime, d-wave, g-wave 
and s-wave (A1g) are in close competition. In the large doping regime, the results show 
that the g-wave pairing competes with both the s-wave (A1g) and d-wave (B2g) pairing, 
and no pairing symmetry emerges dominantly as shown in Fig.15.  
In the spin-fluctuation-mediated pairing, the sign of the superconducting gap should 
change across the nesting vector along the (q,q,0) line. In fact, the superconducting gap 
obtained within this formalism all have nodal structure on the Fermi surface. Hence, the 
experimental observation of a fully open superconducting gap cannot be explained 
within these scenarios. On the other hand, magnetic-interaction-mediated pairing has 
been examined in a model where the nearest and the next nearest neighbor 
antiferromagnetic interactions (J1, J2) between localized spins are considered. There, a 
superconducting state with fully gapped extended s-wave pairing was obtained [60]. 
Taking into account the spin-orbit coupling does not basically affect these results [60].

 The effect of the spin-orbit coupling on superconductivity has also been studied in 
refs.[63,65,66]. In ref.[63], the functional renormalization group method was applied to 
the two-orbital model in the presence of the spin-orbit coupling, There d*x2-y2-wave state 
was found to have the leading pairing instability, where “*” stands for the simultaneous 
rotation operation of both the spin and the lattice. This pairing respects the time reversal 
symmetry, and the triplet and singlet component are mixed, where the former dominates. 
This can be categorized as a time-reversal-invariant weak topological superconductor 
[63]. When the band filling is below the Lifshitz transition point, i.e., when two 
disconnected Fermi surfaces exist around  the sign of the superconducting 
gap changes sign between the two Fermi surfaces, so that the gap is fully open  as 
shown in Fig. 16. The calculated superfluid density based on this state is in good 
agreement with the experimental results (Fig. 17) [66]. An interesting prediction of this 
scenario is that the superconducting gap closes on the edge states because the system 
belongs to the category of weak topological superconductors.

group method [66].

Bi4O4S3 and LaOBiS2 [66]. 
 
The existing theoretical studies basically use the two-orbital model, which consider 
only one BiS plane. Therefore, the effect of the hoppings between the layers is not taken 
into account. The interlayer hopping barely affects the Fermi surface, but the bilayer 
lattice structure itself may affect superconductivity in a manner where the crystal 
symmetry plays some important role. 
Before closing this subsection, we will briefly mention some of the experimental 
observations that may be related to the possibility of (other types of) unconventional 
pairing mechanisms. In ref.[73], the large 2/kBTc was interpreted as an  indication of 
strong pairing interaction and the presence of superconducting fluctuation well above Tc. 
Suppressing the superconductivity by the magnetic field revealed unexpected 
semiconducting behavior in the normal state. These observations were taken as a 
possible indication that the pairing is related to charge density wave or valence 
fluctuations. Speaking of charge fluctuations, local structural distortions that accompany 
long and short Bi-S bond distances (either ferro or antiferro distortive)  have been 
observed in an neutron scattering experiment for polycrystals of La(O,F)BiS2 [35]. This 
local distortive fluctuation was linked to charge disproportionation of the Bi ions, which 
in turn may be related to the pairing mechanism. Also, scanning tunneling spectroscopy 
measurement on NdO1-xFx BiS2 has revealed a “checkerboard stripe” charge ordering on 
the surface [85]. This ordering forms one dimensional stripe structure along the Bi-Bi 
direction.  
For SrFBiS2 [22], an insulator to superconducting transition has been observed. 
Namely, the superconducting phase abruptly appears as soon as the metallicity sets in 
with electron doping by partially substituting Sr with La, and within the 
superconducting phase, Tc interestingly increases with decreasing the electron doping 
content [86]. Similar behavior has been observed in layered nitride superconductors 
MNCl (M=Hf,Zr) [11], where unconventional pairing has been discussed. In MNCl, the 
conduction bands originate from 4d or 5d orbitals, so that the Fermi surface and its 
orbital character are different from those of the BiCh2 based superconductors. However, 
the above experimental observation might suggest a commonality possibly connected to 
unconventional pairing. Other experimental observations have also suggested the 
possibility of unconventional pairing mechanism, e.g. structural instability [35] and 
structural phase transitions under pressure [87] 
 
3.4 Proposals for probing the pairing state 


Various experimental probes to determine the pairing state have been proposed, 
among which are the impurity effect [59], spin excitation [58] and nuclear magnetic 
resonance [66]. In unconventional superconductors with sign reversing order parameters, 
Tc is reduced upon increasing the amount of non-magnetic impurities. In ref. [59], it was 
shown that Tc is strongly suppressed against the impurity content for the p and d-wave 
pairings, while Tc hardly decreases in the s-wave state. In ref.[58], the imaginary part of 
the spin susceptibility of various pairing states was calculated as a probe to determine 
the pairing state. It was shown that the s-wave shows no spin excitation, while spin 
excitations appear at the incommensurate momentum (0.7, 0.7) for d-wave, around 
(0,0) for p-wave. Ref. [66] studied NMR as a probe to detect the d*x2-y2-wave state. 
Although both s-wave and d*x2-y2-wave pairings are fully gapped states (below the 
Lifshitz point for d*x2-y2-wave), the magnitude of the coherence peak just below Tc in the 
spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 is significantly different between the two states due to 
the sign reversal of the order parameter in the latter. Namely, a large coherence peak 
appears in the s-wave, while it is suppressed in the d*x2-y2-wave. Since the d*x2-y2-wave 
state has predominant a spin-triplet pairing component, one might expect that the 
Knight shift can also be used as a probe to detect such a state. The calculation in ref. 
[66] however shows that the difference between s-wave and d*x2-y2-wave is insignificant. 
 
4. Conclusion 
  In this review article, we have surveyed the features of the BiCh2 based 
superconductors from a theoretical point of view. The BiCh2 based superconductors are a 
group of layered superconductors constructed from the pyramidal BiCh2 bilayers, and 
blocking layers having tetragonal structure. In 1112 systems, the electrons can be doped 
into the BiCh plane with fluorine substitution for oxygen. The conduction bands consist 
of the p orbitals within the BiCh plane. The conduction bands and the Fermi surface 
therefore have one dimensional nature with small hoppings along the vertical directions. 
The irreducible susceptibility is enhanced along the (q,q,0) line due to the Fermi surface 
nesting and its one dimensional nature. The calculated phonon dispersion in the 
tetragonal lattice structure also shows the soft phonon modes along the (q,q,0) line. This 
indicates the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling in these materials. The first 
principles electronic band calculation results are overall in good agreement with the 
ARPES experiment, suggesting absence of strong electron correlation as in the 3d-based 
layered superconductors. On the other hand, there do exist some discrepancies between 
theory and experiment, whose origin remains to be clarified. 
  The pairing mechanism has been studied in the context of both conventional and 


unconventional scenarios. Tc values comparable to the experimental observations have 
been obtained within the phonon-mediated pairing owing to the strong electron-phonon 
coupling. As for the unconventional pairing, the weak coupling spin-fluctuation 
calculations omitting the spin-orbit coupling predicts nodal gap functions, while a fully 
gapped s-wave state is obtained for the J1-J2 local spin model. In a model with spin-orbit 
coupling, a functional renormalization group study predicts a d*x2-y2-wave pairing, which 
belongs to the category of the weak topological superconductivity.  In this pairing, the 
triplet and the singlet pairing components are mixed, and the order parameter changes 
its sign between the disconnected Fermi surfaces. Experimental results also suggest the 
possibility of charge-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. 
  As surveyed in this review, the BiCh2 based superconductors have interesting features, 
such as the one dimensional nature of the electronic bands and the Fermi surface nesting, 
strong electron-phonon coupling, and the strong spin-orbit coupling, which may be 
entangled in a complex manner. The issue of the pairing mechanism and the pairing 
symmetry should be closely related to these features. In order to have better 
understanding on these issues, further theoretical as well as experimental studies are 
necessary.
