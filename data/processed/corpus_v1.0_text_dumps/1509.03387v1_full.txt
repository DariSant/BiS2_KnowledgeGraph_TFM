In 
this 
study, 
we 
examined 
the 
thermoelectric 
properties 
of 
the 
layered 
bismuth-chalcogenide-based (BiCh2-based) compound LaOBiSSe, which is expected to be a 
new candidate material for thermoelectric applications.  Densified samples were obtained with 
a hot-press method.  The results of the X-ray diffraction measurements showed that the 
samples obtained were weakly oriented.  This affected the resistivity () and Seebeck 
coefficient (S) of the samples because they are dependent upon the orientation of the crystal 
structure.  The values obtained for the power factor (S2/) when measured perpendicular to the 
pressing direction (P) were higher than that when measured parallel to the pressing direction 
(P//).  The thermal conductivity () of the samples was also sensitive to the orientation.  The 
values of  measured along P// were lower than that measured along P.  The highest 
figure-of-merit (approximately 0.36) was obtained at around 650 K in both directions, i.e., P 
and P//.

The continuous improvement of the thermoelectric properties of materials is required for the 
development of various device-based applications.1  One of the key strategies for improving 
thermoelectric properties is creating a layered structure.  The low-dimensional electronic states 
that result from such two-dimensional crystal structures can be advantageous for producing high 
thermoelectric properties.  It has been argued that quantum effects can also contribute to a high 
thermoelectric performance. 2,3  Several layered compounds, such as Bi2Te3, Co oxides, and 
CsBi4Te6, have exhibited high thermoelectric performances.4-6  Layered materials are also more 
flexible when designing new materials.  For example, the large number of potential 
combinations of elements results in a large variety of materials, as demonstrated by the number 
of Cu oxides and Fe-based layered superconductors.7,8  It is also possible to create materials 
where each layer has a different function, e.g., alternating conducting and insulating layers.  
Thus, because of these aforementioned features, layered structures are suitable for designing 
new, high-performance, thermoelectric materials. 
Recently, BiS2-based materials have been intensively studied in the fields of condensed 
matter physics and chemistry because of the increasing interest in superconductors.9,10  To date, 
superconductivity has been reported for ten different BiS2-based compounds that were subjected 
to electron-carrier doping (see the review article by Mizuguchi11 for further information on these 
materials).  The number of variations in the crystal structure of the BiS2-based family of 


3 
 
compounds is advantageous for designing new thermoelectric materials.  For example, there 
have been many reports on the thermoelectric properties of BiS2-based and BiS2-related 
compounds.12-15  The authors of this paper have reported that the thermoelectric performance 
of the BiS2-based compound LaOBiS2 can be enhanced by partially substituting S with Se.13  
The dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) for the material LaOBiS1.2Se0.8 was found to be 0.17 at 
743 K.  However, our previous study on the LaOBiS2-xSex system was performed with pellets 
that were formed from powdered samples with a relative density of approximately 85%, and the 
ZT values were roughly calculated from the room-temperature thermal conductivity of LaOBiS2 
(2 W/mK).  To investigate the thermal transport and electrical properties of the LaOBiS2-xSex 
system precisely, the thermoelectric properties must be measured with densified samples.  
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of densified samples of 
LaOBiSSe (i.e., x = 1 in the LaOBiS2-xSex system), which were fabricated with a hot-press 
method.  We measured a very low thermal conductivity at approximately 650 K, and thus, 
obtained a ZT value of 0.36.  The anisotropy of the thermoelectric properties of the hot-pressed 
samples was also investigated. 
Polycrystalline samples of LaOBiSSe were prepared according to the solid-state-reaction 
method described in Ref. 13.  The samples were then densified with a hot-press (HP) 
instrument under a uniaxial pressure of approximately 50 MPa.  The LaOBiSSe powders were 


4 
 
sealed in a graphite capsule (diameter = 15 mm) for the HP annealing.  The samples were then 
annealed at 700 C for 1 h.  Thus, a densified LaOBiSSe sample with a relative density greater 
than 99% was obtained.  The as-prepared HP-LaOBiSSe sample was then cut into several 
pieces.  The phase purity was determined with X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the -2 method 
with Cu-K radiation.  To determine the crystal orientation of the HP-LaOBiSSe sample, XRD 
measurements were performed with the scattering vector parallel (P//) and perpendicular (P) to 
the pressing direction (see Fig. 1(d) for a schematic diagram of the P// and P directions).  The 
electrical resistivity () and Seebeck coefficient (S) were measured with a four-point probe 
method (ZEM-3, ADVANCE RIKO) from room temperature to approximately 650 K.  The 
thermal diffusivity (D) and heat capacity (Cp) were measured with the laser-flash diffusivity 
method (LFA-457, Netzsch) from room temperature to approximately 650 K using a standard 
sample of pyroceram.  The thermal conductivity () was calculated from D, Cp, and the density 
of the sample (6.60 g/cm3).  The dimensions of the samples for the  measurements were 
1010 mm and a thickness of 1 mm.  All of the thermoelectric measurements were performed 
in the directions of P and P//. 
Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of the powdered HP-LaOBiSSe.  Nearly all of the XRD 
peaks were indexed with the P4/nmm space group, except for the small concentration of a La2O3 
impurity (7 mol%).  To estimate the degree of crystal orientation in the HP-LaOBiSSe sample, 


5 
 
the XRD measurements were performed with the scattering vector oriented parallel to the P 
and P// directions (Figs. 1(b) and (c), respectively).  These XRD patterns exhibit differences in 
the relative peak intensities.  To qualitatively discuss the crystal orientation, we compared the 
(102) and (004) peaks.  The intensities of the (102) and (004) peaks are almost identical in the 
powdered sample (Fig. 1(a)).  When the scattering vector is parallel to P, the intensity of 
(102) the peak is greater than that of the (004) peak, which indicates that the a-axis (ab-plane) 
has become slightly oriented along the P direction by the HP process (Fig. 1(b)).  In contrast, 
when the scattering vector is parallel to P//, the intensity of the (102) peak is lower than that of 
the (004) peak, which indicates that the c-axis has become oriented along the P// direction by the 
HP process (Fig. 1(c)).  However, these differences are not significant, indicating that the 
as-prepared HP-LaOBiSSe sample is only weakly oriented. 
We then measured the thermoelectric properties along the directions of P and P//.  Fig. 
2(a) shows  as a function of the temperature for the HP-LaOBiSSe sample when the current (I) 
was parallel to the P and P// directions (i.e., I // P and I // P//, respectively).  For both 
directions,  increases with increasing temperature.  However, the values of  when I // P are 
lower than that when I // P//, which is caused by the enhanced electrical conductivity along the 
a-axis (in-plane conductivity).  Fig. 2(b) shows S as a function of the temperature for the 
HP-LaOBiSSe sample when the temperature difference (T) was applied along the P and P// 


6 
 
directions (i.e., T // P and T // P//, respectively).  Both of the directions exhibit negative 
values for S, indicating that the contributing charge-carriers are electrons.  In addition, S 
decreases (the absolute value of S increases) with increasing temperature in both directions.  
The absolute value of S for T // P is slightly larger than that for T // P//.  These differences 
in the electrical properties are caused by the crystal orientation and anisotropic electrical 
conduction of BiCh2-based compounds.16 
Figs. 
3(a) 
and 
(b) 
show 
the 
lattice 
thermal-conductivity 
(lattice) 
and 
total 
thermal-conductivity (total), respectively, as functions of the temperature for the HP-LaOBiSSe 
sample with T // P and T // P//.  lattice is obtained by subtracting the charge-carrier thermal 
conductivity (electron) from total.  electron can be estimated with the equation electron = LT/, 
where L and T are the Lorenz number and absolute temperature, respectively.  Both lattice and 
total decrease with increasing temperature, irrespective of the direction of T.  The lattice and 
total values when T // P// are significantly lower than that when T // P, indicating the 
anisotropy of  along the P and P// directions.  The anisotropy of  is caused by the crystal 
orientation in the as-prepared HP-LaOBiSSe sample. 
The calculated power factor (S2/) as a function of the temperature, for both the P and P// 
directions, is plotted in Fig. 4(a).  The power factor in the direction of P is higher than that in 
the direction of P//.  A high power factor of approximately 6 W/K2cm was obtained above 500

K in the direction of P.  Fig. 4(b) shows ZT as a function of the temperature for the 
HP-LaOBiSSe sample when measured along P and P//.  ZT increases with increasing 
temperature in both directions.  The ZT values in the direction of P// are higher than that in the 
direction of P over the entire temperature range tested.  The higher ZT values in the direction 
of P// were attained because of the lower  values in this direction.  At approximately 650 K, 
the highest ZT value (approximately 0.36) was obtained in both the P and P// directions.  
However, ZT is still increasing at the highest temperature tested in this study, and thus, higher 
ZT values are expected at higher temperatures with the as-prepared HP-LaOBiSSe samples.  
Furthermore, we believe that the power factor and  can be further improved by substituting the 
conducting BiSSe layer and/or the insulating LaO layer.  In addition, to understand the origin 
of the low , an analysis of the crystal structure at high temperatures is needed, and this research 
is currently being performed. 
In conclusion, we investigated the thermoelectric properties of a densified HP-LaOBiSSe 
sample.  A weak crystal oriented was revealed by XRD analysis.  The power factor in the 
direction of P was higher than that in the direction of P//, which is caused by the enhanced 
in-plane electrical conductivity.  The temperature dependence of  in the direction of both P 
and P// was anisotropic.  The  values measured in the direction of P// were much lower than 
that measured in the direction of P direction.  The low  values in the direction of P// were 


8 
 
caused by the low  values in the direction of the c-axis of the HP-LaOBiSSe crystal structure.  
The highest ZT value of 0.36 was obtained in both measurement directions at approximately 650 
K.
