Abstract
To investigate the interlayer interaction in the recently synthesized high-entropy-alloy-type (HEA-type) 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors (RE: rare earth), we have systematically synthesized two sets of samples with 
close lattice parameters (close to those of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) but having different mixing entropy 
(Smix) for the RE site. The crystal structure was investigated using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld 
refinement. For the examined samples having different Smix, the increase in Smix does not largely affect the 
bond lengths and the bond angle of the BiS2 conducting layer but clearly suppresses the in-plane disorder at the 
in-plane S1 site, which is the parameter essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. Bulk nature of superconductivity is improved by the increase in Smix for the present 
samples. The results of this work clearly show that the increase in mixing entropy at the blocking layer can 
positively affect the emergence of bulk superconductivity by modifying the local structure of the conducting 
layer. This is the evidence of the interaction between the high entropy states of the blocking layers and the 
physical properties of the conducting layers.

Materials with a layered structure have been extensively studied as a candidate material in which high-
temperature superconductivity, unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity, high performance of 
thermoelectric conversion, and other functional properties [1-20] could emerge. In the material systems like 
cuprate [1,2], Fe-based [7,8], and BiS2-based [10-18] superconductors, the replacement of a blocking layer, 
which is alternately stacked with a superconducting (electrically conducting) layer, could increase a transition 
temperature (Tc). Namely, the high flexibility of the layered structure is one of the merits of layered compounds 
as a functional material. In addition, the flexibility of stacking structure sometimes enables us to modify the 
crystal structure and superconducting properties. One of the notable examples is the huge pressure effect in the 
BiS2-based superconductors [11-18]. The dramatic increase in Tc in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggested the importance of 
optimization of local structure of the BiS2 layer for the superconductivity in the system [11,17,18].
Recently, we have synthesized BiS2-based superconductors with high-entropy-alloy-type (HEA-type) 
REO (RE: rare earth) blocking layers [21]. In the HEA-type samples, the RE site of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 was occupied 
with five RE elements with a compositional range of 5–35%. The background concept of the study on HEA-
type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a normal HEA, which was proposed by Yeh et al. as an alloy containing at least 5 elements 
with concentrations between 5 and 35 atomic percent [22]. In HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2, the HEA concept was 
extended to a layered superconductor system. Notably, the superconducting properties seemed to be improved
by making HEA-type REO blocking layer as compared to the BiS2-based superconductors with a conventional 
(non-HEA) REO blocking layer [21]. However, in the first report on HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2, the origin of 
the enhanced bulk characteristics of superconductivity was not clarified. In this study, we investigated the high-
entropy (HE) effect to the superconducting properties in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 from the local structure viewpoint. 
The structural concept obtained from this work is summarized in Fig. 1. To discuss the HE effect (the 
effect of the increase in entropy) generated by mixing RE elements (Smix) at the REO blocking layer to the 
superconducting states, two sets of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples with similar lattice parameters (similar lattice 
parameters to those of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) but having different Smix were synthesized. Smix is 
calculated from the equation of

where R, N, and ci are the gas constant, number of 
the component at the mixed site (RE site here), and the atomic fraction of the component, respectively. As an 
important condition, carrier doping amount is fixed as 0.5 per Bi by the 50% substitution of O2- by F- at the 
blocking layer for all the samples. The tuning of lattice parameter was achieved by changing the mixing ration 
of RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm were used in this study. Notably, as depicted in Fig. 1(b), in-plane local disorder
of S1 site, whose amplitude is represented as anisotropic displacement parameter U11, was clearly suppressed 
with increasing Smix. According to the suppression of U11, the superconducting shielding fraction increased, 
which corresponds to the improvement of the bulk nature of superconductivity. In our previous works, we have 
clarified the correlation between the in-plane chemical pressure and superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 [23-
25]. When the Bi-S1 bond distance decreased, in-plane chemical pressure is enhanced in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Furthermore, the in-plane chemical pressure suppresses in-plane local disorder in the Bi-S1 plane, which is 
caused by Bi lone pair [24,25]. By suppressing the in-plane disorder, bulk superconductivity is emerged in 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2. However, in the present Pr-based (or Ce-based) REO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, in-plane chemical 
pressure was tuned at almost the same value by tuning the lattice parameter a at almost the same. Therefore, to

understand the improved superconducting properties by increased Smix in the present systems, we consider that
the HE effect acts like local (chemical) pressure effect. Our results suggest that the HE states in the blocking 
layer can modify the local structure of the conducting layer and can improve the superconducting properties. 
Namely, the HE states at the blocking layer can affect the physical properties by modifying the local structure 
at the electrically conducting layer. This novel concept should be useful for not only BiS2-based superconductors 
but also developing layered functional materials.
The polycrystalline samples of Pr-based REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with nominal RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, 
Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, La0.05Ce0.25Pr0.35Nd0.35, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2 and Ce-based REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with nominal 
RE = Ce, La0.4Pr0.6, La4/15Ce1/3Pr2/5, La0.3Ce0.3Pr0.3Nd0.1, La0.34Ce0.34Pr0.2Nd0.06Sm0.06 were prepared using the 
solid-state-reaction method. Powder of La2S3 (99.9%), Ce2S3 (99.9%), Pr2S3 (99.9%), Nd2S3 (99%), Sm2S3
(99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.999%), BiF3 (99.9%), grains of Bi (99.999%), and S (99.99%) were used. Stoichiometric 
mixtures of the starting chemicals were mixed, pressed into pellets, and heated at 700 C for 20 h in an evacuated 
quartz tube. The obtained sample was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated again under the same heating 
condition to homogenize the sample. Compositional analysis was performed using energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX) with a TM3030 electron microscope system (Hitachi High-Technologies) equipped with a 
Swift-ED (Oxford) EDX analysis system. The composition analyzed by EDX showed values close to the 
nominal composition (see the table I). In this paper, for example, the samples of the Pr-based samples were 
labeled #Pr-1 (RE = Pr), #Pr-2 (RE = Ce0.5Nd0.5), #Pr-3 (RE = Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3), #Pr-4 (RE = 
La0.05Ce0.25Pr0.35Nd0.35), and #Pr-5 (RE = La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2), according to the number of RE elements 
contained in the RE blocking layer.
SXRD was performed at the beamline BL02B02, SPring-8 (proposal number: 2018A0074). The
wavelength of the X-ray was 0.495274 Å. The SXRD experiments were performed with a sample rotator system 
at room temperature; the diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor 
detector (multiple MYTHEN system [26]) with a step size of 2θ = 0.006. The crystal structure parameters were 
refined using the Rietveld method with the RIETAN-FP program [27]. The tetragonal P4/nmm model was used 
for the Rietveld refinements. The single-phase refinement gave good fitting as shown in Fig. 2, and the obtained 
structural parameters are summarized in the table I. Crystal structure images were depicted using VESTA 
software [28].
Figure 3 shows the structural parameters obtained from Rietveld refinements for the #Pr-1, #Pr-2, #Pr-
3, #Pr-4, and #Pr-5 samples. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show the dependences of the lattice parameters a and c on
Smix for the RE site. The lattice parameter a and c are almost independent of Smix for the #Pr-1, #Pr-2, #Pr-3, #Pr-
4, and #Pr-5 samples. In addition, the three Bi-S bond lengths [Fig. 3(c)] and the in-plane S1-Bi-S1 angle [Fig. 
3(d)] are also independent of Smix. As mentioned above, the factor essential for the emergence of 
superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system is the in-plane chemical pressure [23]. From the refined structural 
parameters shown in Figs. 3(a-d), the amplitude of the in-plane chemical pressure in the examined samples is almost 
the same for those samples. Therefore, with those samples, we can investigate the relationship between the local 
structure, superconductivity, and HE effect (increase in Smix). The displacements for the in-plane Bi and S1 sites 


4
were analyzed using anisotropic displacement parameters U11 and U33 for the in-plane S1 and Bi sites [see the 
schematic image of Fig. 1(a)]. Figures 3(e) and 3(f) show the Smix dependences of U11 and U33 for both the in-plane 
Bi and S1 sites. The U11 for the S1 site is quite large for #Pr-1 as compared to that for Bi and decreases with increasing
Smix. The U11 for the Bi site does not show a remarkable change with increasing Smix. The decrease in U11 of S1 
corresponds to the suppression of in-plane disorder at the S1 site, which is essential for the inducement of bulk 
superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 [25]. Namely, the in-plane disorder is suppressed with increasing Smix while 
the amplitude of in-plane chemical pressure is almost constant for the system. The U33 for S1 increases with 
increasing Smix. U33 for the Bi site shows similar trend to U33 for S1.
To investigate the superconducting properties, the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility 
was measured using a superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum design, 
MPMS-3) with an applied field of 10 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). Figure 4(a)
show the temperature dependences of the magnetic susceptibility 4for the Pr-based system. The diamagnetic 
signals due to the emergence of superconductivity are observed for all the samples. The superconducting transition 
temperature is almost the same as listed in the table I. The Tc was estimated from the temperature derivative of 
susceptibility. A superconducting shielding fraction was estimated from the ZFC data at the lowest temperature. 
Tc does not show a remarkable change as the Smix increased. This can be explained by the fixed chemical pressure 
amplitude (a-axis value) [23,26]. However, the superconducting shielding fraction increases with increasing
Smix, indicating the enhancement of bulk nature of superconductivity by the HE effects [Fig. 4(b)]. The direct 
correlation between the suppression of U11 for the S1 site and is a common trend to the in-plane chemical 
pressure effect. On the relationship between U33 and superconductivity, the presence of positive correlation was 
observed in a previous work [25]. This may be suggesting the possibility of the superconductivity mechanisms related 
to the large atomic vibration of in-plane atoms along the c-axis, which was recently revealed in a related compounds 
LaOBiS2-xSex [29].
To examine whether the HE effects observed in the Pr-based system is universal for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2
systems with different lattice parameters, we synthesized the Ce-based samples, #Ce-1, #Ce-2, #Ce-3, #Ce-4, and 
#Ce-5, and investigated the crystal structure and the superconducting properties. As shown in Fig. 5, the samples 
with similar lattice parameter a were obtained. The c parameter slightly decreases with increasing Smix, which may 
be related to the fluctuation of Ce valence [30,31] because the c parameter is largely affected by the slight 
change in carrier concentration. However, the in-plane chemical pressure is basically related to the a parameter 
in this system. As observed in the Pr-based system, U11 for the S1 site decreases with increasing Smix [Fig. 
5(e)]. On the superconducting properties, the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility 4for the 
#Ce-1, #Ce-2, #Ce-3, #Ce-4, and #Ce-5 samples are plotted in Fig. 6(a). increases with increasing Smix. 
The for those samples are plotted in Fig. 6(b). Although the data for the #Ce-5 is scattered, other data 
points indicate the presence of the correlation among Smix, U11(S1), and the superconducting shielding fraction. 
From the results on the Pr-based and Ce-based systems, we propose that the HE effect can modify the local 
structure (particularly, in-plane disorder at the S1 site) of the conducting BiS plane of the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system 
and can be used for improving superconducting properties of the system. 
In conclusion, we have investigated the interaction between the HE states of the REO blocking layer,

the local structure of the electrically conducting BiS2 layer and the superconducting properties of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
The samples with lattice parameters close to PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 (or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) and largely different mixing 
entropy (Smix) for the RE site were synthesized by changing the number of RE elements contained in the REO 
blocking layer. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements, the crystal structure parameters, 
including anisotropic displacement parameters, were investigated. The increase in Smix does not largely affect 
the bond lengths and the bond angle of the BiS2 conducting layer but clearly suppresses the in-plane disorder at 
the in-plane S1 site [U11 (S1)], which is the parameter essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in 
the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. As expected, bulk nature of superconductivity, shielding volume fraction in the 
superconducting states, is enhanced by the increase in Smix. The present results clearly show that the increase 
in mixing entropy at the blocking layer can positively affect the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the 
conducting layer while these layers can be regarded as spatially-separated. The evidence of the interaction 
between the HE states of the blocking layer, the local structure conducting layer, and the physical properties of 
the material should be a novel strategy useful to design new layered materials and to enhance the functionality 
using the concept of high entropy alloy.
