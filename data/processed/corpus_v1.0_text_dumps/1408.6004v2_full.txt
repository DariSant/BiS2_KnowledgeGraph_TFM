Abstract  
  Until recently, spin-polarization in nonmagnetic materials was the exclusive territory 
of non- centrosymmetric structures. It was recently shown that a form of “hidden spin 
polarization” (named the “Rashba-2” or “R-2” effect) could exist in globally 
centrosymmetric crystals provided the individual layers belong to polar point group 
symmetries. This realization could considerably broaden the range of materials that 
might be considered for spin-polarization spintronic applications to include the hitherto 
‘forbidden spintronic compound’ that belong to centrosymetric symmetries. Here we 
take the necessary steps to transition from such general, material-agnostic condensed 
matter theory arguments to material-specific “design principles” that could aid future 
laboratory search of R-2 materials. Specifically, we (i) classify different prototype 
layered structures that have been broadly studied in the literature in terms of their 
expected R-2 behavior, including the Bi2Se3-structure type (a prototype topological 
insulator), MoS2-structure type (a prototype valleytronic compound) and 
LaBiOS2-structure type (a host of superconductivity upon doping); (ii) formulate the 
properties that ideal R-2 compounds should have in terms of combination of their 
global unit cell symmetries with specific point group symmetries of their constituent 
“sectors”; (iii) use first-principles band theory to search for compounds from the  
prototype family of LaOBiS2-type structures that satisfy these R-2 design metrics. We 
initially consider both stable and hypothetical M’OMX2 (M’: Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Al, 
Ga, In, Tl; M: P, As, Sb, Bi; X: S, Se, Te) compounds to establish an understanding of 
trends of R-2 with composition, and then indicate the predictions that are expected to be 
stable and synthesizable. We predict large spin splittings (up to ~ 200 meV for holes in 
LaOBiTe2) as well as surface Rashba states. Experimental testing of such predictions is 
called for.

I. Introduction: The local real-space view of hidden spin polarization in 
centrosymmetric nonmagnetic crystals 
  Traditionally, the origin of spin polarization in nonmagnetic solids has been 
attributed to spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within crystals that lack global inversion 
symmetry 1. Crystals that possess instead global inversion symmetry would not have 
such a bulk Rashba-type (referred to as R-1), or Dresselhaus (referred to as D-1) 
polarization 2, 3 and would thus not be considered as candidates for spintronic 
applications. An alternative view has been proposed recently 4 that starts from the fact 
that since the SOC is a highly localized interaction anchored on atomic sites, it is the 
local environment (encoded in point group of sites) rather than the overall crystal 
symmetry that is an appropriate starting point for discussing SOC-induced spin 
polarization. Indeed, the inversion asymmetry in local real space “sectors” of a crystal 
leads to local spin polarization; the superposition of such polarizations from local 
sectors over the entire crystal would then produce the total (zero or nonzero) crystalline 
polarization. If the system lacks global inversion symmetry, the net effect would be 
nonzero, leading to the well-known bulk R-1 and D-1 effects with their respective 
distinctive spin textures. On the other hand, if the system as a whole does have a global 
inversion symmetry (centrosymmetric space groups) but the individual sectors are each 
inversion-asymmetric, still an interesting form of compensated polarization (see Fig. 1 
a-h) could arise 4, 5 called R-2 and D-2, respectively  
  While the foregoing argument provided a material independent “proof of existence” 
for these effects, it did not tell the experimentalists where to look for such effects. The 
current work takes a step in the direction of aiding identification of such materials by 
systematically classifying the possible band structure and local spin polarization of 
different R-2 candidates, and then pointing to a group of materials that is predicted to 
have significant R-2 effect, showing thus where to look for such effects. Transitioning 
from material-independent to material-specific predictive theory could be helpful here 
because despite the importance of spintronics the material base currently used for it is 
rather narrow. This approach could broaden the type of materials that can be used and

provide cross coupling between hidden spin polarization and other functionalities that 
also reflect spin-orbit physics (such as topological insulation or valleytronics) present 
in the same layered structures considered here for hidden spin polarization. 
II. Examples of prototypical groups of layered compounds that manifest R-2 
and/or D-2 effects: Bi2Se3, LaOBiS2 and 2H-MoS2 
A. Symmetry considerations 
  In Fig. 1a-h we consider the three leading classes of layered structures exemplified by 
the Bi2Se3-type (space group R-3m, Fig. 1f) structure, the idealized LaOBiS2–type 
(P4/nmm, Fig. 1g) structure, and the 2H-MoS2-type transition-metal dichalcogenide 
(P63/mmc, Fig. 1h) structure. The unit cells of these structure types contain two, 
inversion asymmetric sectors that together form a centrosymetric crystal. An 
intermediate buffer layer that contains an inversion center can separate these spin-orbit 
active inversion-partners.This intermediate section is supplied by the Se monolayer in 
Bi2Se3, the LaO monolayer in LaOBiS2, or just vacuum in 2H-MoS2. Now, a single 
inversion asymmetric (IA) layer/sector α induces an effective magnetic field (owing to 
the existence of SOC in a low-symmetry environment 1), and thus has spin polarization 
that is localized on that sector. If the crystal unit cell has an inversion center, there must 
be another sector β carrying local spin polarization with opposite spin texture. The 
corresponding energy bands must then be spin-degenerate due to the combination of 
inversion symmetry and time reversal symmetry, so the total spin, integrated over 
momentum (k) space of these bands is zero. But such global k-space compensation 
between the spins of the degenerate energy bands need not occur on a point-by-point 
basis in real space. Indeed, explicit first-principles calculations of such a 
centrosymmetric crystal4 have shown that the spin polarization is not locally 
compensated on each individual sector. Instead, there is distinct, residual spin on each 
sector. This effect is not restricted to one unit cell but can exist in slab geometry, in 
which the surface states of both sides manifest opposite spin polarization. This will be 
demonstrated later on in Sec IV and Fig. 6.  
  We refer to the hidden spin polarization in centrosymmertic bulk crystals made of 
sectors having a polar field as the R-2 effect4, to be distinguished from bulk Rashba 


 
5
effect in non-centrosymmetric crystals (the R-1 effect) 8, 9. Similarly, we refer to the 
hidden spin polarization in centrosymetric bulk crystals made of IA sectors as the D-2 
effect, to be distinguished from the D-1 effect in non-centrosymmetric crystals. In 
general, the crystal structure of R-2 material contains simultaneously polar field and 
inversion asymmetry, hence the coexistence of R-2 and D-2 effects4. Rather than being 
intrinsically absent, the R-2/D-2 effect in centrosymmetric crystals is concealed by 
global compensation, but present locally on a sector-by-sector basis. In particular, the 
R-2 effect is expected to be prevalent in layered structures because the IA sectors 
therein would experience a polar field along the stacking direction when there is 
nonequivalent bonding between the two sides of the spin-orbit active layer. In such 
structures one could induce the removal of the perfect compensation present in an R-2 
crystal by applying a small electric field or creating a surface 6. This R-2 effect 
broadens the range of bulk compounds that can be considered for such spintronic 
applications to include centrosymmetric crystals. 
  The general criteria for R-2 behavior are rather broad: centrosymmetric crystals with 
atomic sites that belong to polar group symmetry (point groups C1, C2, C3, C4, C6, C1v, 
C2v, C3v, C4v, and C6v). Such a broad definition applies to a large number of structure 
types include, for example the structures shown in Fig. 1f-h as well as to 
antiferroelectric materials in MgSrSi-type (Pnma) and NaNbO3-type (Pbcm) structures 
7. Since these compounds have different characteristic crystal structures and band 
structures, it will be useful to develop more specific criteria for sorting out within these 
materials, which is likely to have the best R-2 characteristics. In this paper we will 
classify the different prototype band behavior of such R-2 layered materials, and then 
focus on the key ingredient that determines the quality of such R-2 materials and 
investigate the spin polarization features of a few compounds from the LaOBiS2-type 
materials as favorable R-2 candidates. 
B. Classification of band structure prototypes for layered centrosymmetric R-2 
crystals: Bi2Se3, LaOBiS2 and 2H-MoS2 types 
  To get a better understanding of the band structure and spin localization based on 
different factors, we consider in Fig. 1 the evolution starting from one single IA sector 


 
6
that is a part of a centrosymmetric material.  
In step (i) of Fig. 1, we consider a single sector α (e.g., a layer) obtained by cleaving 
the layered structure into two IA sectors. The isolated sector could be (BiSe)+ layer in 
Bi2Se3, or the (BiS2)- layer in LaOBiS2, or the MoS2 layer in 2H-MoS2. In the absence 
of SOC (Fig. 1a) each band is spin degenerate.  
In step (ii) we introduce SOC into a single sector (Fig. 1b,c), which results in spin 
splitting due to the absence of inversion symmetry. We distinguish two types of wave 
vector k and their vicinities: In Fig. 1b we consider k-points that are time reversal 
invariant (TRI), e.g., Γ (0, 0, 0) and X (0, 1/2, 0), where the band degeneracy at the 
crossing point between the two bands is protected by time reversal symmetry, whereas 
in Fig. 1c we show wave vector k that is non-TRI e.g., k = K (1/3, 1/3, 0) in the 
hexagonal Brillion zone of 2H-MoS2. Here the two spin-split bands do not cross but are 
nested within each other.  
In step (iii) we add to sector α its inversion partner — sector β — having the same 
chemical composition but a reversed spatial configuration. Together they form the 
structure α + β that has global inversion symmetry (Fig. 1d through 1h). In Fig. 1d,e we 
assume that there is no interaction between sectors (e.g., infinitely separated sectors), 
so the ensuing band structure represents a superposition of the bands from both layers, 
leading to two-fold degenerate bands, each containing opposite spin polarizations 
localized on the respective individual sectors, as shown by red (α) and blue (β) arrows. 
Because α and β sectors do not communicate with each other, the local spin on each 
sector remains the same as if only that sector exists. Thus, in this ideal R-2 case we have 
distinct polarizations on each real-space sector. We next acknowledge in step (iv) that 
the sectors interact with each other, causing band repulsion and mixture of the local 
spin polarization between the sectors, thus diminishing relative to step (iii) the purity of 
the individual spin polarizations localized on each layer.  
  We next distinguish three material types here by discussing their R-2/D-2 effect 10 
and the interplay between hidden spin polarization and their other functionalities: 
  1. Bi2Se3: The case of strong coupling between individual R-1 layers leading to 
R-2 behavior 


 
7
  Fig. 1f illustrates Bi2Se3 (space group R-3m), where the site point group of the two Bi 
atoms and the two side Se atoms belongs to the polar group C3v, indicating an R-2 
material; while that of the middle Se atom belongs to the centrosymmetric point group 
D3d. We consider TRI k point Γ and strong layer coupling because of the proximity of 
these two (BiSe)+ layers 11 and the absence of any effective intervening layer between 
them (an atomically -thin layer of Se). Here the coupling lifts the degeneracy, forming 
two isolated, non-crossing bands (unless the crossing point of two offsetting bands is 
protected by other symmetries such as fractional translation). Moreover, considering 
the Bi2S3 quintuple layer as a whole unit that consists two Rashba layer (BiSe)+, such 
material has strong intra-unit coupling (between two (BiSe)+ sectors) and weak 
inter-unit coupling (van der Waals interaction). Considering the band structure 
evolution from Fig. 1a to 1f we see that the inter-unit interaction is so strong that the 
upper band bends to form the conduction band with an inverted band curvature. A 
recent tight binding model showed that such layer-by-layer stacking of oppositly- 
aligned Rashba layers could lead to a bulk topological insulator, revealing the 
fundamental interplay between such R-2 structure and the topological physics 12. 
  Another consequence of the strong coupling between sectors is the spin mixture 
between different sectors, (shown in Fig. 1f) leading to a reduction in the net spin 
polarization localized on each sector. In other words, the formation of topological 
insulating behavior in Bi2Se3 requires strong coupling between spin-active sectors, 
which diminishes the residual spin on each sector.  
  2. 2H-MoS2: The case of weak coupling between individual D-1 layers leading to 
D-2 behavior 
 Fig. 1h illustrates 2H-MoS2 (space group P63/mmc), where we consider k = K which is 
non-TRI wavevector in the hexagonal structure. This structure has weak layer coupling 
because the two spin-active sectors (MoS2 layer) are coupled by van der Waals 
interaction. For monolayer MoS2, the site point group of Mo atom is D3h symmetry 
leading to D-1 behavior, while that of S atom is C3v symmetry leading to R-1 + D-1 
behavior. However, the low-energy spectrum at the K valley of MoS2-type material is 
dominated by the transition metal atom Mo, indicating that the spin physics in the 


 
8
vicinity of K is predominately a D-1 effect. Given that the spin component Sz at 
non-TRI K valley is a good quantum number, such type of Dresselhaus spin splitting 
effect does not have a band crossing, but results in a Zeeman-like splitting in which the 
spins are out-of-plane and up and down spin locate at nested energy bands, respectively 
(see Fig. 1c) 13, 14. 
  Comparing with the D-1 case of monolayer of MoS2, the bulk 2H-MoS2 changes the 
space group of the unit cell but not that of the site point groups of Mo and S atom. 
Consequently, as shown in Fig. 2h, the spin polarization at K valley in 2H-MoS2 is 
governed by the D-2 effect. The weak communication between inversion partners 
causes slightly larger separation of the nested bands and spin mixture from another 
layer, but most of the spin at the K valley remains on each layer.  
  The D-2 hidden spin polarization incorporated with the valleytronic physics in 
monolayer MoS2 leads to many novel phenomena apparent in n monolayers 
two-dimensional (2D) structures. For n = odd the system is non-centrosymmetric and is 
expected to manifest effects related to this absence of inversion such as circular 
polarized luminescence originating from valley effects 15, 16. In contrast, for n = even 
(and for bulk 2H-MoS2) inversion symmetry is present and thus no circular polarization 
is expected15. However, both theory 18 and experiments showed that circular polarized 
luminescence does exist in such centrosymetric cases as an intrinsic feature due to the 
of the fundamental spin-orbit physics17, 18. This is because the significant D-2 effect 
causes spin-polarized absorption when excited by circular polarized light, and thus 
leads to imbalance luminescence for different helicity17, 19. 
  3. LaOBiS2: advantages and possible applications of the R-2 effect 
  Fig. 1g illustrates LaOBiS2 and related compounds. Here we discuss the properties of 
the M’OMX2 compounds by assuming the nominal centrosymmetric structure P4/nmm. 
For this centrosymetric structure we consider TRI k point k = X with weaker layer 
coupling because the two spin-active BiS2 sectors in the unit cell are separated from 
each other by a barrier layer of La2O2. Here the bands still maintain a crossing at k = X 
where interlayer coupling vanishes due to the fractional translation operation 
(non-symmorphic symmetry) that translates a layer to its inversion partner. In the 


 
9
vicinity of X, the band splitting is slightly enhanced by the layer interaction, comparing 
with that of step (iii), implying that the residual spin can mostly survive the interlayer 
coupling.      
  The discussion above indicates that case of LaOBiS2 having weak interlayer coupling 
and strong SOC in each IA sector contains essentially two copies of Rashba spin 
polarization with significant but opposite spin textures localized on each sector, to 
which we will refer as favorable R-2 effect. This type of R-2 compensated spin 
polarization can have possible advantages over the bulk R-1 and the traditional 
two-dimensional (2D) Rashba effects regarding the manipulation of spin for potential 
applications. First, comparing with the ordinary 2D Rashba effect 3, the R-2 
bulk-induced effect can have a larger spin splitting (more than 100 meV in LaOBiS2) 
owing to the stronger polar field 9, 20 created by the intrinsic atomic configuration. 
Second, compared with the R-1 effect in non-centrosymmetric bulk materials such as 
BiTeI 8, 9, it is easier to manipulate the spin states of R-2 systems by selecting different 
spin-active sectors via small electric fields without reversing the internal polar field. 
Recently reported ferroelectric R-1 crystals such as GeTe could also manipulate the 
spin polarization due to the field-induced reversal of atomic displacements 20. However, 
the corresponding switch speed in proposed spin-FET is much slower than that built on 
R-2 materials in which electric field controls the band structure and thus the spin state, 
because electron moves much faster than nucleus. Therefore, R-2 in LaOBiS2 materials 
could offer advantages for the design of spintronic devices based on spin field effect 
transistors 21. Third, the exploration of R-2 materials could significantly expand the 
range of materials with certain functionalities (e.g., second harmonic generation, 
photogalvanic 
effect, 
etc.) 
that 
is 
previously 
limited 
to 
low-symmetry 
non-centrosymmetric structures. 
III. Searching for other R-2 compounds within the M’OMX2 family  
  We will next study the broad group denoted M’OMX2 (M’: group IIIa such as Sc, Y, 
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, or IIIb such as Al, Ga, In, Tl; M: group V such as P, As, Sb, Bi; X: group 
VI such as S, Se, Te). Our purpose is to identify the chemical and structural parameters 
that could control the quality of the R-2 effect, and then suggest that such bulk-induced 


 
10
spin polarization could be detected at the surface, indicating promising spintronic 
applications made of centrosymmetric crystals. 
A. Crystal structure  
  The nominal centrosymmetric structure P4/nmm (T0) structure, which has equal Bi- 
S1 bonds in x-y plane, was used in X-ray refinement of the crystal structure of the 
prototype material LaBiOS2 first in 1995 22, and in many other following experiments 
23-25. However, recently it was shown theoretically that phonon instability will make the 
two in-plane Bi-S1 bonds in the assumed P4/nmm structure LaOBiS2 non equivalent 
26 so as to remove the instability. Such in plane bond inequivalence was verified by 
neutron diffraction experiment 27. These observations exclude the P4/nmm structure as 
a possible ground state for LaBiOS2 despite the tradition of fitting X-ray data to this 
model. We have considered the possible 3D stacking sequences of the in plane 
deformed 2D Bi-S1 planes and found that three polytypes are possible: two 
non-centrosymmetric (T1 of symmetry P21mn and T2 of symmetry C2) and one 
centrosymmetric (T3 of symmetry P21m). Upon total relaxation we find that for 
LaBiOS2 the centrosymmetric structure T3 is very slightly lower in energy than the 
other two structures. Thus, the final LaBiOS2 structure is still either the ground state 
centrosymmetric T3 = P21m (so hidden R-2 spin polarization is expected) or a mixture 
of the polytypes that are non-centrosymmetric. In the latter case one can expect net spin 
polarization (D-1 or R-1) emerging from breaking the global inversion symmetry. We 
further examined some other LaOBiS2-type materials and found that some of them 
have T0 = P4/nmm strcture as the ground state (e.g., LaOBiTe2), while others have the 
T3 = P21m structure as the ground state (e.g., LaOSbS2). All are thus centrosymmetric, 
albeit rather close energetically to the non-centrosymmetic polytypes. In the present 
study we assume uniformly the centrosymmetric T0 = P4/nmm structure for all 
M’OMX2 compounds so as to maintain straight comparison between different R-2 
behaviors. 
B. Model Hamiltonian description of R-2 effect 
Following the transition of band structure in Fig. 1, here we discuss the model 
Hamiltonian of single MX2 layer as a conventional Rashba system, and introduce the 


 
11
effect of inversion partner and interlayer coupling to get the band composition and the 
wave functions of the 2-fold degenerate band. Then we prove that there are two Rashba 
states with opposite spin texture localized on two MX2 layers, respectively. 
First, considering the relativistic Hamiltonian of an otherwise free electron in one 
MX2 layer, with the SOC effect included

C. First-principles calculation methods and electronic structure of M’OMX2 
compounds 
  All the first-principles calculations were performed with the Vienna ab 
initio package (VASP) 28. The geometrical and electronic structures are calculated by 
the projector-augmented wave (PAW) pseudopotential 29 and the generalized gradient 
approximation of Perdew, Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE) to the exchange-correlation 
functional 30. Spin-orbit coupling is all through calculated by a perturbation

momentum eigenstate of ith atomic site 31. The plane wave energy cutoff is set to 550 


 
13
eV. Electronic energy minimization was performed with a tolerance of 10−4 eV, and all 
atomic positions were relaxed with a tolerance of 10−3 eV/Å. There are four variable 
cell-internal degrees of freedom, i.e., the z-component of M’, M, X1 (forming in-plane 
M-X bonds) and X2 (forming perpendicular M-X bonds) site, that can be relaxed, while 
the other coordinates are protected by the crystal symmetry. In the bulk calculations, 
the lattice parameters are fully relaxed. In surface calculations, the atomic positions 
were relaxed with the lattice constant a fixed as the bulk one. The vacuum separation in 
the slab supercell is 20 Å to avoid the interaction between periodic images.  
  The triple-layer (TL) structure can be written as (MX2)-/(M’2O2)2+/(MX2)- made of 
two spin-active MX2 rocksalt-like layers (sectors α and β) and an intermediate buffer 
layer M’2O2 separating them, with the fluorite-like structure (see Fig. 2a). The distance 
between two adjacent MX2 layers is controlled by the van der Waals interaction. We 
show in Fig. 2c,d the band structures of bulk M’OMX2 exemplified by the prototype 
compound LaOBiS2 with its tetragonal Brillouin zone given in Fig. 2b. Here MX2 = 
BiS2 and M’2O2 = La2O2. From the calculated electronic structures we find that the 
low-energy spectrum originates mainly from the spin-active BiS2 layers. Specifically, 
the six lowest conduction bands are dominated by Bi-p states, whereas the highest 
valence bands are composed of the S-p and Bi-s orbitals. On the other hand, the states 
originating from the La2O2 layer have little contribution to the bands near the Fermi 
level but appear at energies 3 eV above the conduction band maximum (CBM) or 1 eV 
below the valence band minimum (VBM) near the X valley.  
  In the absence of SOC (Fig. 2c), there is an extra two-fold band degeneracy along the 
symmetry line X-M and R-A for all the energy bands. This degeneracy results from the 
non-symmorphic aspect of the space group P4/nmm, i.e., from the participation of 
fractional translations (1/2, 1/2, 0) in the space group. Such fractional translation 
operation translates α (BiS2) layer into β (BiS2) layer along the real-space direction that 
corresponds to X-M direction in k-space, along which the interlayer coupling between 
chemically identical α and β BiS2 layers vanishes. 
  When turning on the SOC (Fig. 2d), the band splitting along the Γ-X direction is 
caused by the combination effect of weak layer interaction (between two adjacent BiS2 


 
14
layers though van der Waals layer) and SOC-induced spin splitting, as shown in Fig. 2e 
and f. The layer interaction is dominantly from the channel through van der Waals layer, 
while the channel through La2O2 layer is nearly blocked. Therefore, The real-space 
separation of “different polarization on different sectors” would mostly survive 
interaction between the sectors that could mix the polarizations. Furthermore, the 
four-fold degeneracy along the X-M direction is reduced to two-fold, forming split 
bands that intersect at both the k = X and k = M wave vectors. This effect indicates the 
emergence of pure Rashba splitting on each of the two inversion partner layers, induced 
by the local IA environment felt by two BiS2 sectors.  
  Using the tight-binding model discussed before we can easily understand the effect of 
SOC on the band structure of M’OMX2. Without SOC, we have ݐ࢑ൌߙோൌ0 along 
X-M, indicating four-fold degeneracy including spin from Eq. (5), while along Γ-X, 
ݐ࢑്0; thus, we have ܥ࢑ൌ
ଵ
√ଶ, resulting in bonding and antibonding states according 
to Eq. (6) and (7). When SOC is available, we have ݐ࢑ൌ0 but ߙோ്0 along X-M,

Rashba splitting emerges on each layer due to the local inversion asymmetry. We note 
that although the intervening (La2O2)2+ layer does not contribute to the low-energy 
spectrum of eigenstates, it provides ionic charges that set up opposite polar fields 
pointing to α and β (BiS2)- layers (along z and –z direction, see Fig. 2), and thus make 
two BiS2 layers form Rashba-type spin polarizations with opposite spin textures. 
Although the two copies of spin polarization with opposite spin states form degenerate 
bands in the E vs. k representation, each tends to be localized in real space on one of the 
two MX2 layers. 
D. Choice of series of materials within the M’OMX2 type  
  As noted above, a clear feature that could enhance the R-2 quality is the existence of 
an effective electronic separation between the two inversion partners, as illustrated in 
the transition from Fig 1d,e to Fig 1f-h. We will thus explore various barrier layers 
M’2O2 keeping its 2+ charge. Another important factor that determine the spin 
polarization is the magnitude of the SOC, anchored on different atoms in the 


 
15
spin-active MX2 layer. We will thus consider different chemical identities for M and X 
and address how the magnitude of spin splitting depends on SOC of various atomic 
sites.  
  The O site has non-polar site point groups S4 and thus does not contribute to the 
whole R-2 effect, so we do not change chemical identity for this site. Therefore, we 
classify the material groups into 3 series, using LaOBiS2 as a prototype structure. In 
series I we vary the cation of the MS2 layer in LaOMS2 using M = P, As, Sb, Bi. In series 
II we vary the anion of BiX2 layer in LaOBiX2 using X = S, Se, Te. In series III we vary 
chemical identity of the M’2O2 layer in M’OBiS2 using M’ = Sc, Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Al, 
Ga, In, Tl, Bi, and a recent reported compound SrFBiS2 that has the same structure 32. 7 
of the 17 compounds studied here have been reported in the experimental literature to 
have the P4/nmm structure22, 32-34. We include in our study 11 additional compounds 
(marked asterisks in Table I) that are unreported in the experimental literature but will 
be used to complete the theoretical trends in the computed R-2 features. 
E. Choice of metrics that reveal R-2 characteristics  
The Rashba parameter αR, defined by ቚ
డா
డ௞ቚ
௞ୀ௞బ
, where k0 is the wave vector of the 
band crossing point, is often used to assess the strength of the Rashba effect. However, 
for the functionality-driven materials screening used here, targeting large spin splitting, 
both the spin splitting energy Es and the corresponding momentum offset ks, shown 
schematically in Fig. 2e,f and the insert of Fig. 4, are of interest. Note that we define 
both Es and ks along X-M direction, because the band splitting along this direction 
results entirely from SOC. For R-2 materials without symmetry-protected band 
crossing, the band splitting consists both SOC-induced spin splitting and interlayer 
coupling. In this case Es could be defined as ඥܧௌ
ଶെܧேௌ
ଶ, where ES (ENS) denotes the 
band splitting with (without) the implementation of SOC. Indeed, a larger Es is 
desirable for stabilizing and controlling spin while a larger momentum offset ks is 
advantageous for achieving a significant phase contrast between different spin and is 
thus favorable for the spin transport 21. In contrast, αR only evaluates the proportion of 
Es/2ks for the ideal parabolic bands, but neither Es nor ks that are both useful for 


 
16
application.  
F. Predicted R-2 compounds from the M’OMX2 family 
The band structures of the M’OMX2 exhibit robust R-2 effects, as shown in Fig. 4. 
We list the band gaps (Eg) and main quantities related to R-2 splitting, including Es, ks 
and αR, in Table I. Since the carrier types could be tuned by intrinsic defects or carrier 
injection in reality, here we consider the local spin splitting for both hole and electron 
states. Compared with electrons, the spin splittings of holes are generally more 
significant. Therefore, we plot the design metrics Es and ks for holes (Es-h and ks-h, 
respectively) of different M’OMX2 members classified into three categories, as shown 
in Fig. 5. We note the following main features: 
  (i) R-2 characteristics in compounds with different spin-active MX2 components: 
The R-2 matrics of series II and I differ significantly through the different choices of the 
spin-active MX2 layers. Specifically, Except LaOBiSe2, when increasing the atomic 
number of M or X elements, all the quantities related to spin splitting, i.e., Es-h, ks-h and 
αR-h, enhance with a broad range from LaOPS2 to LaOBiTe2 0.3-196 meV, 0.001-0.073 
Å-1, and 0.07-2.43, respectively. Such spread implied that besides the local inversion 
asymmetric environment, the SOC on various atomic sites of the spin-active layer MX2 
is also a determining factor to the magnitude of favorable R-2 effect. With the atomic 
number increasing, the spin splitting effects become more remarkable.  
  (ii) Effect of the buffer layer on R-2 characteristics: Although the intermediate layer 
affects very little the low energy spectrum, we can still find variation of spin splitting 
accompanied with varying buffer layers. To explain this unexpected effect, we calculate 
the site dipole field of M’, M and X sites for all the compounds. Assuming the 
calculated static Coulomb potential near site ࡾ࢏ is ܸ௜ሺ࢘ሻ, and then we can expand

The fist-order term [ܸఈ
௜] denotes dipole field vector (its norm is ඥሺܸఈ
௜ሻଶ) that coupled 
with atomic SOC and thus induces local spin polarization. We note that in series III, 
despite the valence state of each layer is unchanged, the site dipole field of Bi reduces 


 
17
when carrying less electronegative elements, as shown in Table II. This might be a 
reason that causes the whole Es-h and ks-h to reduce. 
  (iii) Contrasting the Rashba parameter αR-h with the alternative metrics of Es-h and 
ks-h: For ideal parabolic bands, we have ݇௦ൌ݉ߙ௦ /԰ଶ and ܧ௦ൌ2݉ߙ௦
ଶ/԰ଶ, so αR here 
is evaluated by Es/2ks. However, as illustrated in Table I, the relationship between 
Rashba parameter αR-h and Es-h or ks-h are not monotonic since Es-h and ks-h in real 
materials are also related to band curvature (i.e. effective mass m). For example, 
according to αR-h it seems that BiOBiS2 (αR-h = 1.55) has a better R-2 functionality than 
TlOBiS2 (αR-h = 1.46). On the other hand, Es-h of TlOBiS2 is 46% larger than that of 
BiOBiS2, while ks-h 133% larger, apparently indicating that TlOBiS2 is a better R-2 
candidate. Other examples include the contrast between LaOSbS2 (series I) and 
LaOBiSe2 (series II), InOBiS2, TlOBiS2 and BiOBiS2 (series III). Consequently, larger 
αR does not definitely point to more significant spin splitting and better R-2 
performance. Instead, both of Es and ks need to be addressed. 
IV. How can the R-2 effect be observed: Surface signatures 
  R-2 effect in such centrosymmetric layered materials could be observed if α and β 
sector are not equivalently detected, since the spin polarizations of the two sectors at 
this time are not exactly compensated by the global inversion symmetry. Especially, by 
truncating the bulk into surface states, we can dominantly detect the spin-active layers 
(MX2) at the surface, and thus separate the bulk-induced spin polarization that hidden in 
3D materials. It is also desirable to eliminate the interaction between two MX2 layers 
and acquire an ideal Rashba effect in the 2D electron gas. Taking LaOBiS2 as an 
example, due to the van der Waals interaction between adjacent BiS2 layers, both of the 
bulk-truncated sides are BiS2-terminated. Therefore, there is only one isolated BiS2 
layer at each surface since the buffer La2O2 layer blocks the interlayer coupling. Figure 
6a plots the band spectrum of the 9-TL slab with a vacuum thickness of 20 Å between 
periodic images. We found that the electron surface states locate far away from the 
Fermi level. On the other hand, the hole surface states emerge from the bulk with 
significant band splitting, and decay rapidly into the slab, as shown in Fig. 6b,c.  
  Moreover, since the top and bottom sides are global inversion partners, the two-fold 


 
18
degenerate surface states are localized at the top and bottom surfaces with opposite spin 
patterns, analogous to the behavior of surface Dirac fermions in the 
inversion-symmetric topological insulators 35, 36. The hole spin splitting energy and the 
corresponding momentum offset are 114 meV and 0.025 Å-1, respectively. These values 
are quite similar to their counterparts in bulk calculation, demonstrating that the spin 
splitting here is predominately induced from the bulk structure, which is the same 
mechanism of the Rashba effect in some non-centrosymmetric bulk R-1 materials 8, 9, 20. 
Such effect could be very robust and easy to reproduce since no additional requirements, 
such as artificial doping, intercalation, interface, or electric control is needed. The 
experimental evidence of the surface Rashba behavior by the SR-ARPES 
measurements is also expected. 
V Discussion: the effects of interlayer coupling on the R-2 characteristics 
  We note that whether bulk compounds or artificial superlattice, in R-2 systems made 
of IA inversion partners, the interlayer coupling plays a crucial role in determining the 
properties and potential applications of the whole system. In general, the interactions 
between two IA sectors form a pair of bonding and antibonding states, and opens a gap 
at the band crossing point. This IA bilayer scenario could lead to a novel phase diagram 
of topological superconductivity 37. If the intralayer interaction (through the buffer 
layer) is strong while the interlayer interaction is relatively weak, e.g. van der 
Waals-like, the outer branch of the original bands could even begin to reverse due to the 
electron hybridization, offering possibilities for topological insulators with a new 
mechanism 12. On the other hand, in the R-2 system M’OMX2, we observe a pair of 
nearly perfect Rashba spin polarization, implying the immunity of states hybridization. 
  Increasing the interlayer coupling, i.e., compressing the materials along z-axis would 
enhance the mixture between different spin states of different layer and thus reduce the 
local spin polarization. On the other hand, it will also enhance the polar field felt by 
each sector and thus the spin splitting. In LaOBiS2-type materials, the M’2O2 layer 
effectively blocks the interaction between two MX2 layers. As a result, the local spin 
polarization is not sensitive on small uniaxial strain along z-axis. However, the local 
polar field and spin splitting could be tuned more significantly by such strain. For 


 
19
example, if we impose 5% compressive strain on LaOBiS2 z-axis, the spin splitting 
energy for holes Es-h will increase 14%. Therefore, one can explore variety of tunable 
spintronic properties by controlling the coupling between IA layers in such systems, 
and thus pave an accessible avenue to design new functional materials or 
heterostructures.

That which effect in R-2/D-2 dominates the spin physics depends on the band 
character at specific k-point, and the site symmetry of the atoms that have the 
leading contribution to the state.

Actually, the unit cell of Bi2Se3 in hexagonal structure consists three quintuple 
layers shown in Fig. 1f, with same chemical configuration. In this case the 
dominate factor that determines band structure is also the interlayer bonding, in 
other words, interaction between two (BiSe)+ layers within each quintuple layer
