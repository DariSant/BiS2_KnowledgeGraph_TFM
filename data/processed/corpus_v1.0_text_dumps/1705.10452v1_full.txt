Abstract 
Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown using a CsCl/KCl flux. The grown crystals have 
a plate-like shape with ~1-2 mm square size in a well-developed ab-plane. The Cd doping in the 
crystals was successfully characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction and electron probe 
microanalysis techniques. The superconductivity of La(O,F)BiS2 was gradually suppressed with Cd 
doping. 
The 
superconducting 
transition 
temperature 
with 
zero 
resistivity 
of 
La(O0.54F0.46)(Bi0.92Cd0.08)S2 was 2.3 K. The Cd doping does not change the superconducting 
anisotropy so much, albeit the considerable suppression of Tc.

Main text 
 
1. Introduction 
BiS2-layered superconductors provide a variety of compounds, such as Bi4O4S3 [1], R(O,F)BiS2 (R: 
La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb, Bi) [2-8], AFBiS2 (A: Sr, Eu) [9-11], La1−uMuOBiS2 (M: Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) [12], and 
Eu3F4Bi2S4 [13]. The S-site in these compounds can be substituted by Se (BiSe2- and BiSSe-based 
compounds) [14,15], where these compounds are now called BiCh2-based compounds (Ch: S, Se). 
The Bi-site also can be replaced by Sb, as the example of R(O,F)SbS2. However, SbS2-based 
compounds do not show superconductivity [16]. On the other hand, the partial substitution of Ag 
[17], Cu [18], and Pb [19] for Bi-site all show superconductivity. Especially, Pb substitution 
enhances the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) [19]. These results indicate that 
substitution of the other elements for Bi-site may enhance superconducting properties. In the view 
point of the ionic radii, the candidates of substitution species are Hg, Tl, Cd, and so on. It has been 
reported that it is able to substitute Cd for Bi-sites in the cuprate superconductors, Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+d 
[20]. Then we focused on the doping effect of Cd for Bi-site.  
In this paper, we synthesized the Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals by the CsCl/KCl flux 
method [21-23]. The grown single crystals were characterized by single crystal X-ray structural 
analysis, and investigated its doping effect on the superconducting properties including the 
anisotropy.  
 


2. Experimental 
Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown by a high-temperature flux method in an 
evacuated quartz tube using La2S3, Cd, Bi, S, Bi2S3, Bi2O3, BiF3, CsCl, and KCl as raw materials. 
The synthesis and characterization procedures are similar to the previous studies in the literature, 
except for the Cd-doping [22]. The raw materials were weighed with the nominal composition of 
La(O0.5F0.5)(Bi1-xCdx)S2 (x = 0-0.20). The mixture of the raw materials (0.8 g) and the CsCl/KCl flux 
(5.0 g) with a molar ratio of 5:3 was combined using a mortar, and then sealed into a quartz tube 
under vacuum (~10 Pa). This mixed powder in the quartz tube was heated at 800 °C for 10 h, cooled 
slowly down to 600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, and then furnace-cooled to room temperature. The quartz 
tube was opened in air, and the flux in the obtained material was dissolved into distilled water. The 
remained product was then filtered, and washed with distilled water.  
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured by using Rigaku MultiFlex with CuKα 
radiation. Single crystal XRD structural analysis was carried out using a Rigaku Mercury CCD 
diffractometer with graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71072 Å) (Rigaku, 
XtalLABmini). The crystal structure was solved and refined by using the program SHELXT and 
SHELXL [24,25], respectively, in the WinGX software package [26]. The compositional ratio of the 
single crystals was evaluated by energy dispersive spectroscopic (EDS) analysis and electron probe 
microanalysis (EPMA) associated with the observation of the microstructure by using scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM). The magnetization–temperature (M–T) curves under zero-field cooling 
(ZFC) were measured using a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) with an applied 
magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis, except for a sample with x = 0.10 (100 Oe). The 


resistivity–temperature (ρ–T) characteristics were measured by the standard four-probe method with 
a constant current density mode using physical property measurement system (Quantum Design; 
PPMS DynaCool). The electrical terminals were fabricated by Ag paste. The angular (θ) dependence 
of resistivity (ρ) in the flux liquid state was measured under various magnetic fields (H). The 
superconducting anisotropy (γs) is estimated using the effective mass model [27].  
 
3. Results and discussion 
Obtained Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are plate-like shape with ~1-2 mm in size with a 
thickness of 10-50 μm. Figure 1 shows XRD patterns of a well-developed plane in a single crystal 
grown from starting powder with nominal composition of La(O0.50F0.50)(Bi1-xCdx)S2. The XRD 
patterns of the grown single crystals with x = 0, 0.05, 0.10 show only 00l diffraction peaks of 
La(O,F)BiS2 structure, indicating that the ab-plane is well-developed. The typical back scattered 
electron (BSE) image of obtained single crystals is shown in Fig.2 (a). However, when x is increased 
up to 0.15, the XRD pattern shows multiple phase of La(O,F)BiS2 and Cs2Bi2CdS5 [28]. This is also 
clearly seen in a BSE image with two kinds of contrasted regions as shown in Fig. 2 (b). The EDS 
compositional analysis indicates that the blight and dark contrasted regions correspond to 
Cs2Bi2CdS5 and Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2, respectively. XRD pattern of the single crystals with x = 
0.20 (the top line of Fig.1) was identified to that of Cs2Bi2CdS5 with a well-developed plane of (101). 
La(O,F)BiS2 have never grown in the nominal composition of x ≥ 0.20 within the growth condition 
of this study. These results suggest that the Cs2Bi2CdS5 starts to grow above x = 0.15.  
In the obtained single crystals with x = 0-0.10, they were composed of La, O, F, Bi, Cd, and S 


elements, whereas the flux components of Cs, K, and Cl elements were not detected by qualitative 
analysis of EPMA within the detection limit of 0.1 wt%. The estimated Cd-contents (y), estimated 
F-contents (z), and the c-axis lattice parameter (c) in the obtained single crystals are summarized in 
Table I. The values of x and y were normalized by the total Bi+Cd amount, and the values of z were 
also normalized by the total O+F amount. The value of y increased up to 0.12 with increasing x to 
0.10. The c-axis lattice parameters of the obtained single crystals decreased with increase of y, but 
the values of z are comparable to each other. If we assume that the c-axis lattice parameter is 
correlated to the both of the estimated Cd-contents (y) and F-contents (z), these results suggest that 
Cd is doped in the obtained single crystals, and the solubility limit of Cd in La(O,F)BiS2 is ca. 0.12.  
The single crystal structural analysis was successfully performed using the crystals with y = 0.08. 
The refinement converged to the R1 value of 7.19 % for I ≥ 2σ(I) for 16 variables including 
anisotropic parameters. The atomic coordinates and displacement parameters are given in Tables II 
and III. The compound crystallizes with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.0647(7) Å, c 
= 13.328(3) Å, and Z = 1). The basic structure of this crystal is isostructural with La(O,F)BiS2, 
La(O,F)BiSSe and La(O,F)BiSe2 [2,14,15]. All atoms were located at special positions and their 
anisotropic displacement factors were all positive and within similar ranges, all of which appeared to 
be physically reasonable. Since the occupancy refinement in O and F under constrain of Occ.(O) + 
Occ.(F) = 1 did not converge in the refinement, the occupancies were fixed to the EPMA-estimated 
composition, O:F = 0.54:0.46. Note that the refinement of Cd inclusion was converged only in the 
case of partial substitution of the Bi site with reasonable occupation value. Taking into account the 
result of EPMA analysis, Cd atoms are successfully doped to the Bi sites. Figure 3 shows the M–T 


curves for the Cd-doped and non-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with comparable F-contents. 
The shielding volume fraction was strongly suppressed by Cd doping, compared to the non 
Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2. The superconducting transition was not observed in the single crystals with 
y = 0.12 down to 1.8 K. Figure 4 shows the ρ–T characteristics down to 1.8 K in the single crystals 
of the Cd-doped and non-doped La(O,F)BiS2 with comparable F-contents (z = 0.46) [22]. The ρ–T 
characteristics of the Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with y = 0.12 showed 
semiconducting-like behavior, and it did not show zero resistivity down to 1.8 K. The Cd-doped 
La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with y = 0.08 exhibit a resistivity drop at around 4 K, and zero resistivity 
below 2.3 K. These results indicate that the temperature of zero resistivity was also suppressed by 
Cd doping, compared to that found in the single crystals of non Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 with 
comparable F-contents. Impurity doping into the superconducting layer usually leads to degradation 
of superconductivity in the layered superconductor. Cd-doping in this study may also affect to the 
superconducting properties, then the superconductivity in this compound would lead to suppression. 
As shown in the inset of figure 4, the resistivity of Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with y = 
0.08 shows two superconducting onsets around 4 K and 3 K. This is probably attributed to the tiny 
inhomogeneous distribution of Cd elements in the obtained single crystals.  
The resistivity (ρ) was measured under different magnetic fields (H) in the flux liquid state to 
estimate the superconducting anisotropy (γs) by using the same method with Refs. 29 and 30. The 
reduced field (Hred) is calculated using the following equation for an effective mass model:  
Hred = H(sin2θ+γs
-2cos2θ)1/2                     (1) 
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field [27]. The γs was estimated from the 


best scaling of the ρ–Hred relationship. Figure 5 shows the θ dependence of ρ for different magnetic 
fields (H = 0.1-9.0 T) in the flux liquid state for Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with y = 0.08. 
The ρ–θ curve exhibited a two-fold symmetry. Figure 6 shows the ρ–Hred scaling obtained from the 
ρ–θ curves in figure 5 using Eq. (1). The scaling was performed by taking γs = 36. The value of γs in 
Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with y = 0.08 was almost the same compared to that of 
non-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with comparable F-contents (z = 0.46) (γs = 23-37) [31]. 
These results suggest that the Cd doping does not change the anisotropy so much albeit the strong 
suppression of Tc.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Cd-doped La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown by using CsCl/KCl flux method with ~1-2 mm 
square size in a well-developed ab-plane. The X-ray single crystal structural refinement and EPMA 
compositional analysis were well revealed the Cd doping to the single crystals. The solubility limit 
of Cd to Bi-site in La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was found to be around 12 at%. The temperature of 
zero resistivity of the obtained single crystals was gradually suppressed with Cd-doping. The 
superconducting transition temperature with zero resistivity of La(O0.54F0.46)(Bi0.92Cd0.08)S2 was 2.3 
K, and the superconducting anisotropy was 36. The suppression mechanism of Tc unlike Pb-doped 
BiS2-based compounds should be investigated in the future, by using the other method, such as 
scanning tunneling spectroscopy, photoemission spectroscopy and so on.
