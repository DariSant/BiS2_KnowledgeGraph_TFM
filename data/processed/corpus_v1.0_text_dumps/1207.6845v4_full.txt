Abstract 
Phase pure samples of LaOBiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are synthesized by conventional solid state 
reaction route via vacuum encapsulation technique at 800oC for 12h. Both the samples are 
crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group with lattice parameters a = 4.066(1) Å, c = 
13.862(4) Å for LaOBiS2; a = 4.069(5) Å, c = 13.366(2) Å for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Bulk 
superconductivity is confirmed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 with superconducting transition temperature 
(Tc) of 2.7K by DC magnetization and resistivity measurements. The Isothermal magnetization 
(M-H) measurement shows closed loops with clear signatures of flux pinning and irreversible 
behavior. The magneto-transport ρ(T,H) measurements show resistive broadening and decrease 
in Tc (ρ=0) to the lower temperature with increasing magnetic field. The magnetic phase diagram 
involving upper critical and irreversibility fields as a function of temperature has been 
ascertained. The upper critical field Hc2(0) is estimated to be ~19kOe corresponding to a 
Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of ~130 Oe.

1. Introduction 
The apparent commonalities among cuprates, pnictides, and heavy fermion superconductors 
have reorganized the material guidelines in the search of new high Tc superconducting systems. 
Very recent example of the same is LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [1].  In this respect, significant attention has 
been paid towards ZrCuSiAs type compounds, particularly since the discovery of 
superconductivity in F-doped LaFeAsO with Tc ~26 K [2]. Maintaining the basic structural unit 
of FeAs, couple of new systems have also been reported recently, such as CeNi0.8Bi2 [3] and 
doped LaCo2B2 [4] with superconducting transition temperature at around 4K. These compounds 
mimic the superconducting characteristics of layered CuO2 and FeAs based High Tc 
superconductors. Moreover, the very recent observation of superconductivity around 5.5 K in 
NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.10-0.70) [5, 6] has once again emphasized the possibility of a new series of 
superconductors based on layered sulfides. In fact, this has already generated a great deal of 
interest in material science community [7, 8]. Various rare earth substitutions are being done to 
induce/enhance Tc [7, 8]. The scaling of Tc can be seen with rare earth ionic size variation [1, 5-
8] i.e. it is increasing with decrease in rare earth ionic size. Further, the doping mechanism in 
BiS2 based superconductors appears to be similar to that of cuprates and pnictides [9]. In this 
article, we report the synthesis and basic physical property characterization of LaO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 
0.0 and 0.50) compounds. Both the compositions crystallized in ZrCuSiAs type tetragonal 
structure with space group P4/nmm. While x = 0.5 composition exhibits bulk superconductivity 
with a transition temperature of 2.7K, the x = 0.0 composition has the insulating nature with a 
characteristic resistivity upturn. The superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is confirmed 
from both magnetization and transport measurements.

2. Experimental 
The samples were synthesized through standard solid state reaction route via vacuum 
encapsulation. High purity La, Bi, S, LaF3, and La2O3 were weighed in stoichiometric ratio and 
ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. The powders were 
subsequently pelletized and vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in separate quartz tubes. Sealed quartz 
ampoules were placed in tube furnace and heat treated at 8000C for 12h with the typical heating 
rate of 2oC/min., and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of 6h to the room 
temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in the scattering 
angular (2θ) range from 10o-80o in the steps of 0.02o, using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ 
= 1.54Å) radiation. Rietveld analysis was performed using the FullProf program. Detailed DC 
magnetization and transport measurements were performed on Physical Property Measurements 
System (PPMS-14T, Cryogenics).  
3. Results and discussion 
The synthesized samples are black in color and hard in nature. The Rietveld refined room 
temperature XRD pattern of LaOBiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples are shown in Figure l (a). 
Rietveld refinement is carried out using ZrCuSiAs structure and Wyckoff positions. The samples 
are crystallized in tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm. Rietveld refinement shows 
both the samples are free from any Bi impurity phase. Worth mentioning is the fact that some Bi 
and Bi2S3 impurity were seen in studied samples of ref.1.  Our samples are nearly phase pure at 
least with in XRD detection limit and superconducting for x = 0.5. Refined structural parameters 
(lattice parameters, atomic coordinates and site occupancy), are shown in the Table 1.   
The representative unit cell of the compound in P4/nmm space group crystallization is shown 
in Figure 1(b). The layered structure includes La2O2 (rare earth oxide layer) and BiS2 (fluorite 


4 
 
type) layers. Various atoms with their respective positions are indicated in Figure 1(b). Bismuth 
(Bi), Lanthanum (La), and Sulfur (S1 and S2) atoms occupy the 2c (0.25, 0.25, z) site. On the 
other hand O/F atoms are at 2a (0.75, 0.25, 0) site. 
Interestingly, the carrier doping mechanism is same as that of reported LaFeAsO [2]. In 
LaFeAsO/F the carriers are doped from LaO/F to superconducting FeAs layer. Similarly, in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, mobile carriers are doped from LaO/F redox layer to superconducting BiS2 layer. 
Considerable decrease in c-parameter (~ 0.5 Å) is observed with F doping at O site. Change in 
lattice parameter confirms the substitution by F at O site. Also the 004 peak shifts towards higher 
angle side in F doped sample.  
The magnetization data as a function of temperature under applied magnetic field of 30Oe is 
shown in Figure 2. The magnetization measurements are performed in both FC (Field cooled) 
and ZFC (Zero-field-cooled) protocols. The LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound shows sharp 
superconducting onset at 2.7K. The bifurcation of FC and ZFC below Tc marks the irreversible 
region. The superconducting shielding fraction as evidenced from ZFC diamagnetic volume 
susceptibility is around 6%, which is comparable to that (~10%) as reported in ref. 1. In fact, the 
increase of volume fraction of superconductivity in these systems is yet warranted. The inset in 
Figure 2 shows isothermal M-H curve of the sample at 1.8K. The MH plot is indicative of type-II 
behavior and mixed state is clearly seen. Summarily, the FC/ZFC magnetization and isothermal 
magnetization M-H data confirm bulk superconductivity in studied LaO0.5F0.5BiS2.  
 
Figure 3 shows the resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) measurements in zero field and in 
presence of external magnetic field. Cooling from room temperature, the resistance of the sample 
increases with decreasing temperature and undergoes superconducting transition with an onset Tc 
~2.7K and Tc (ρ=0) at 2.4K. The zero field resistivity of parent and F doped samples up to room 


5 
 
temperature is shown in the upper inset. The pristine compound exhibits a resistivity upturn 
similar to what is seen in oxy-pnictides the origin of which is under investigation. 
On the other hand normal state conduction of doped compound is evidently like a 
semiconductor that implies that the electron doping is not optimum and probably higher Tc is 
achievable. With the application of magnetic field both the onset and offset Tc decrease to lower 
temperature. Defining the intersection point between normal state resistivity extrapolation and 
superconducting transition line as the upper critical field Hc2(T) and the intersection of 
superconducting line with the temperature axis as the irreversibility field H*, we have estimated 
both Hc2(T) and Hirr(T) as a function of temperature. This is shown in the lower inset of Figure 3.  
We note that Hc2(0) represents complete destruction of superconductivity where as H* 
denotes onset of resistivity in the mixed state. The slope dHc2/dT|Tc is estimated to be ~ 10kOe/K 
that implies WHH (Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg) Hc2(0) (= - 0.69 Tc dHc2/dT|Tc) value of 
19kOe. From this, the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length (ξ = 2.07*10-7/2πHc2)1/ 2 is estimated 
to be ~ 130Å. Unlike the other new BiS2 superconductor i.e., Bi4O4S3 [10-11], positive magneto-
resistance is not observed in normal state of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. This is because the reported Bi4O4S3 
[10-11] samples were contaminated with Bi impurity.   
In Figure 4 we plot the Hall resistivity as a function of magnetic field at T = 10K. Unlike 
Bi4O4S3, a linear response is indicated in this relatively low field regime. The conduction 
mechanism is dominated by electrons and the calculated Hall coefficient and carrier 
concentration at 10 K are n = 1.24 x1020 per cm3 and RH = 5.04036 x 10-8 m3/C. The carrier 
concentration is about one order of magnitude higher than Bi4O4S3 [7-8].

4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, the newly discovered LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor is synthesized in single 
phase and its bulk superconductivity is established below 2.7K from both magnetization and 
magneto-transport measurements. The normal state resistivity is semiconducting, implying a 
possibility for further increase in Tc with optimized doping and chemical pressure. The H-T 
phase diagram shows linear variation of upper-critical field as a function of temperature near Tc 
and Hc2(0) is estimated to be ~ 19 kOe. The present communication is not only the timely 
reproduction of the ref.1 results but the sample quality is slightly improved in terms of phase 
purity.
