Abstract 
Sb-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals with 0.2-1.0 mm size have been successfully 
grown using CsCl/KCl flux. Sb substitution strongly suppressed the superconductivity 
in CeOBiS2, and the substitution of more than approximately 4 at% in Bi-site 
disappeared the superconductivity at a measurement range of above 0.36 K. 
Furthermore, the drastic change of c-axis lattice parameter was observed in a 
neighborhood to Sb substitution amount, which maybe suggests the structural transition 
in CeOBiS2. The Ce valence state of the obtained single crystals was evaluated. 
However, the established correlations between Ce valence state and superconductivity 
could not be revealed.

Introduction 
Layered compounds often exhibited superconductivity with high transition 
temperatures, which were commencing with cuprate superconductors [1,2] and 
iron-based superconductors [3]. BiS2-based layered superconductors were formed from 
superconducting layer and block layers which were similar layered structures to 
iron-based superconductors [4]. La(O,F)BiS2 and La(O,F)FeAs were one of the 
BiS2-based and iron-based superconductors, respectively. The difference of those 
superconductors was only superconducting layers which are between BiS2-layer and 
FeAs-layer. However, the superconducting transition temperature of La(O,F)BiS2 
superconductors was extremely lower than that of La(O,F)FeAs superconductors. The 
clarification of that reason is important for the mechanism of high transition temperature 
superconducting phenomena. We focused on La(O,F)BiS2 which is a typical BiS2-based 
superconductor. La-site in La(O,F)BiS2 can be substituted by each/several rare earth 
elements (RE: Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Yb) [5-11]. The O-site was partially substituted by F in 
the block layers of those compounds which were RE(O,F)-layers. In consequence, the 
electron carriers were supplied to the BiS2-layer (superconducting layer), resulting in 
the inducement of superconductivity. Ag [12], Cu [13], Pb [14], and Cd [15] were 


 
5
performed to substitute with partially Bi-site, or S-site was substituted by Se [16,17] in 
the BiS2-layer which was the superconducting layer. Especially, Pb and Se substitutions 
enhanced 
the 
superconducting 
transition 
temperature. 
In 
contrast, 
La-site 
perfectly/partially substituted with Ce (CeOBiS2) exhibited superconductivity without 
F-substitution [18-21]. The origin of this superconductivity was the supply of carriers 
from the valence fluctuation of Ce [22]. On the other hand, The Bi-site can be perfectly 
replaced by Sb, which was a CeOSbS2 compound. Despite this compound was observed 
Ce valence fluctuations, it exhibited no superconductivity [23]. Moreover, the crystal 
system becomes the change between CeOBiS2 and CeOSbS2. CeOBiS2 and CeOSbS2 
were tetragonal and monoclinic crystal systems, respectively. In focusing on other 
superconductors, Sb substitution in Bi-site suppressed the superconductivity such as 
RhX2 [24] and LaNiX2 (X = Bi, Sb) [25]. Sb substituted with Bi-site in superconductors 
may be an important role in superconductivity.  
In this paper, a systematic investigation between Sb substitution and superconductivity 
for CeOBiS2 superconductor was performed using single crystals grown by CsCl/KCl 
flux method [26,27]. The relationship between Sb substitution and Ce valence state was 
also investigated. The boundary Sb concentration of superconductivity was revealed in 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals which were partially substituted with Sb in CeOBiS2.

Methods 
Sb-substituted CeOBiS2 single crystals were grown using CsCl/KCl flux [18,23]. The 
raw materials of Ce2S3, Bi2O3, Bi2S3, Sb2O3, Sb2S3 were weighed to have a nominal 
composition of CeOBi1-xSbxS2 (0.02 ≤ x ≤ 0.40). The molar ratio of the CsCl/KCl flux 
was CsCl:KCl = 5:3. The mixture of the raw materials (0.8 g) and CsCl/KCl flux (5.0 g) 
was ground using a mortar and then sealed in an evacuated quartz tube (~10 Pa). The 
prepared quartz tube was heated at 950 °C for 10 h, followed by cooling to 600 °C at a 
rate of 1 °C/h, then the sample was cooled down to room temperature (~30 °C) in the 
furnace. The heated quartz tube was opened to air and the obtained materials were 
washed and filtered to remove the CsCl/KCl flux using distilled water.  
The compositional ratio of the grown crystals was evaluated using energy dispersive 
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Bruker; Quantax 70) associated with the observation of the 
microstructure, 
based 
on 
scanning 
electron 
microscopy 
(SEM) 
(Hitachi 
High-Technologies; TM3030). Analytical compositions of each element were defined as 
CXX (XX: Ce, O, Bi, Sb, S). The obtained compositional values were normalized using 
CBi + CSb = 1.0 (Bi + Sb analytical composition was 1.0), and then Ce, O, and S 
compositions (CCe, CO, and CS) were determined. The crystal structure and the c-axis 


 
7
lattice parameters of the grown crystals were identified using X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
(Rigaku; MultiFlex) with CuKα radiation.  
The resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) characteristics of the grown single crystals were 
determined using the standard four-probe method with a constant current density (J) 
mode using a physical property measurement system (Quantum Design; PPMS 
DynaCool). The electrical terminals were fabricated using Ag paste (DuPont; 4922N). 
The ρ–T characteristics in the temperature range of 0.36-15 K were determined based 
using the adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) option for the PPMS. A 
magnetic field of 3.0 T at 1.9 K was utilized to operate the ADR, which was 
subsequently removed. Consequently, the temperature of the sample decreased to 
approximately 0.36 K. The measurement of ρ–T characteristics were initiated at the 
lowest temperature (~0.36 K), which was spontaneously increased to 15 K. The 
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) was estimated from the resistivity 
measurement. The zero resistivity (Tczero) is determined as the temperature at which the 
resistivity is below approximately 100 µΩ cm. The obtained resistivity values were 
normalized by ρ/ρ15K. (ρ15K: the resistivity value at 15 K). The transition temperature 
corresponding to the onset of superconductivity (Tconset) is defined as the temperature at 
which deviation from linear behavior is observed in the normal conducting state for the 


 
8
temperature dependence of normalized resistivity value (ρ/ρ15K–T).  
The valence state of the Ce and Bi component in the grown single crystals was 
estimated using X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis of Ce-L3 
and Bi-L3 edges using an Aichi XAS beamline with synchrotron X-ray radiation 
(BL5S1: Proposal No. 202104005 and 2022D3006). To prepare samples for the XAFS 
spectroscopy measurements, the obtained single crystals were ground and mixed with 
boron nitride (BN) powder, before being pressed into a pellet of 4 mm diameter. The 
ratios of Ce3+ and Ce4+ in the grown single crystals were calculated using linear 
combination fitting of the Ce2S3(Ce3+) and CeO2(Ce4+) reference samples. For the Bi 
valence state, reference samples were Bi2S3(Bi3+) and NaBiO3(Bi5+).  
 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of a CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystal which was a 
plate-like shape with a size of 0.2-1.0 mm and a thickness of approximately 150 µm. 
Table I shows the nominal Sb contents (x) and analytical compositions of each element 
(Ce, O, Bi, Sb, and S) for the obtained crystals. Analytical Sb compositions (CSb) were 
lower than the nominal Sb contents (x). The CSb values of the obtained crystals with x = 
0.05-0.08 exhibited similar values within the analytical error using EDS analysis. The 


 
9
values of analytical compositions for other elements (CCe, CO, and CS) were higher than 
the stoichiometric compositions which were Ce:O:S = 1:1:2. In other words, the total of 
the Bi and Sb compositions was lower than the stoichiometric composition. It suggested 
that Bi-site becomes a slight deficiency. Previous reports indicated the Bi-site deficiency 
in the parent compounds [28,29].  
Figure 2 (a) shows XRD patterns of a well-developed plane in the grown 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals. The obtained XRD patterns corresponded to only (00l) 
diffraction peaks of CeOBiS2 structure [18]. It indicated that CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single 
crystals were grown and the c-plane is well-developed. The c-axis lattice parameters 
were calculated from (0011) diffraction peaks. Analytical Sb compositions (CSb) 
dependence of the c-axis lattice parameters was shown in Figure 2 (b). The c-axis lattice 
parameters were almost decreased with increasing CSb except for CSb = 0. It indicated 
that the Bi-site was substituted by Sb which is small ionic radii. However, the c-axis 
lattice parameters of the non-Sb substitution sample (CSb = 0) were smaller than those of 
CSb ≤ 0.043 samples. That reason is unclear. The decreasing rate of the c-axis lattice 
parameters was drastically changed at the boundary between CSb = 0.043 and 0.045. We 
presumed that the crystal system was changed to a monoclinic crystal system. CeOBiS2 
is tetragonal crystal system [22]. On the other hand, CeOSbS2 exhibited the monoclinic 


 
10
crystal system [23], which is completely Sb substitution in Bi-site. Approximately 5 at% 
Sb substitution in the Bi-site may change the crystal system of CeOBiS2.  
The superconductivity in various Sb substituted CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals was 
investigated. Figure 3 (a) shows the temperature dependence of the normalized at 15 K 
resistivity (ρ/ρ15K) for the grown CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals. Superconducting 
transitions were observed in the CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals with CSb = 0.015, 0.023, 
0.035, and 0.043 at above 0.36 K. The resistivity in the normal state (above the Tc) was 
slightly decreased with an increasing temperature, exhibiting the semiconducting 
behavior. On the other hand, the single crystals with CSb ≥ 0.045 showed 
non-superconductivity with only semiconducting behavior. Therefore, we simply 
presumed that the carrier concentration of CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 has decreased with the increase 
in Sb substitution. In the previous report [22], CeOBiS2 superconductivity originated 
from the carrier supply which was provided from the Ce mixed valence state (Ce3+ and 
Ce4+). The investigation of the Ce valence state in the grown CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single 
crystals will be shown in Figure 4. The CSb dependence of the superconducting 
transition temperature (Tconset and Tczero) was summarized in Figure 3 (b). The Sb 
substitution drastically decreased the superconducting transition temperature compared 
to the single crystal without Sb substitution (CSb = 0). It indicates that Sb substitution 


 
11
strongly suppresses the superconductivity in CeOBiS2. CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals 
with CSb ≤ 0.043 exhibited superconductivity. However, the CSb values range of 
0.043-0.045 was the same within the analytical error (See in Table I). Therefore, we 
considered that the boundary of superconductivity and non-superconductivity for the Sb 
substitution amount in CeOBiS2 was approximately 0.04 (approximately 4 at% Sb 
substitution in the Bi-site).  
Figure 4 (a) shows the Ce L3-edge XAFS spectra at room temperature of some grown 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals, Ce2S3 (Ce3+ reference sample), and CeO2 (Ce4+ reference 
sample). The obtained Ce L3-edge XAFS spectra demonstrated a peak at around 5725 
eV and were assigned to trivalent electronic configuration (Ce3+) [30]. Moreover, the 
peaks around 5730 eV and 5737 eV were assigned to tetravalent electronic 
configuration (Ce4+) [31]. All evaluated CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals exhibited a Ce 
valence fluctuation caused by a mixture state of Ce3+ and Ce4+. The ratios of Ce3+ and 
Ce4+ were estimated using linear combination fitting of Ce2S3 (Ce3+) and CeO2 (Ce4+) 
through XAFS spectra. Ce4+ ion concentration ratios of each analytical Sb composition 
(CSb) for the grown CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals were shown in Figure 4 (b). The Ce4+ 
ion concentration ratios were increased with the increase CSb, except for the CSb = 0. 
However, no clear signature difference was observed at the boundary between 


 
12
superconductivity and non-superconductivity corresponding to CSb = 0.043 and 0.045, 
respectively. Therefore, there was no clear correlation of Ce4+ ion concentration ratios 
with CSb. It indicates that the superconductivity in CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 may not be affected by 
the Ce mixed valence state. On the other hand, the Bi valence state of Bi3+ and Bi5+ for 
the grown CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals was evaluated using Bi L3-edge XAFS spectra. 
Only the Bi3+ state was observed in all evaluated samples which were the same samples 
in Figure 4. The Sb valence state was not able to be evaluated by an Aichi XAS 
beamline for the X-ray energy. Further characterizations of these single crystals are 
therefore necessary to clarify the superconductivity suppression from the Sb substitution. 
Additional experiments such as Sb valence state and precise single crystal structure 
analysis are also required.  
 
Conclusions 
CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 single crystals with a size of 0.2-1.0 mm and approximately 150 µm 
thickness were successfully grown using CsCl/KCl flux. The Sb substitution strongly 
suppressed the superconductivity in CeOBiS2, and Sb concentration between 
superconductivity and non-superconductivity was estimated to be approximately 4 at% 
in the Bi-site. A drastic change in the c-axis lattice parameters was observed around this 


 
13
Sb concentration. On the other hand, no relationship between Ce4+ ion concentrations 
and superconductivity for CeO(Bi,Sb)S2 superconductors was found.
