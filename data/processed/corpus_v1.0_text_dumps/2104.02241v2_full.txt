The nature of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors has been controversial while ab-
initio calculations proposed this system in close proximity to a charge-density-wave (CDW) phase.
Using high-energy high-ﬂux X-ray diﬀraction, we reveal an intrinsic and long-range CDW phase
coexisting with superconductivity in NdO1−xFxBiS2 superconductor (x = 0.37 and 0.3). The CDW
wavevector in NdO0.63F0.37BiS2 correspond QCDW = (0.17, 0.17, 0.5) and is associated with trans-
verse atomic displacements. Interestingly, this wavevector does not match theoretical expectations
based on either phonon softening or Fermi surface nesting. In NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, where the super-
conducting transition temperature is highest, the CDW satellites are slightly broader and weaker
compared to NdO0.63F0.37BiS2, possibly suggesting the competition with the superconductivity.
Lastly, we measure a thermal diﬀuse scattering across the superconducting transition temperature
and ﬁnd no meaningful changes. Our result suggests the importance of understanding CDW which
might hold a key to the superconductivity in the BiS2-based superconductor.
I.
INTRODUCTION
The BiS2-based superconductors have many similar-
ities with the unconventional cuprates and iron-based
superconductors1–6.
Their layered structure is low di-
mensional composed of BiS2 superconducting layers and
Ln2O2 (Ln:
Lanthanide) blocking layers alternating
along the c-axis. Moreover, Bi ions responsible for the su-
perconductivity are arranged in a square lattice. On the
other hand, Bi is not magnetic and shows 6px,y orbital
characters, which have less electron correlation compared
with 3d orbitals7. The highest transition temperature re-
ported is relatively low ≈11.5 K8.
The nature of superconductivity in BiS2-based super-
conductors, therefore, has been controversial whether it
can be considered as a conventional phonon-mediated
BCS superconductor or another family of non-BCS su-
perconductors that opens a new route to unconventional
superconductivity. Density functional theory (DFT) cal-
culations have predicted a signiﬁcant electron-phonon
(e-ph) coupling9–12, that was later supported by Ra-
man experiment13. Meanwhile, many ab initio studies
also ﬁnd strong Fermi surface nesting (FSN) near opti-
mal doping7,9,10 that can lead to unconventional pairing
mechanisms14–20. Inelastic neutron scattering on poly-
crystalline samples21 and Raman studies22 indicate that
the possible e-ph coupling can be much weaker than the-
oretically expected. Yet, a momentum-resolved phonon
study on a single-crystalline sample is still lacking.
Interestingly, theoretical studies predict negative en-
ergy phonon modes possibly related to the FSN that
leads to ferroelectric or charge-density-wave (CDW)
phases9,10.
According to the ab-inito calculation, in
LaOBiS2, there is a ferroelectric soft phonon at the
zone center, whose shallow potential curve prevents the
development of static long-range order.
In the opti-
mally doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, on the other hand, un-
stable phonon branches are expected along the q = (δ,
δ, 0) causing the in-plane distortion of the BiS2 plane,
especially the shift of S atoms by about 0.16 ˚A away
from the high-symmetry position. Total energy analysis
ﬁnds the structure with the lowest energy to be a

2 CDW superstructure with sinusoidally distorted
one-dimensional Bi-S chains.
The relation between CDW and superconductivity
has been hotly debated as CDW turns out to be a
ubiquitous ground state found in the phase diagram
of many unconventional superconductors, for example,
cuprate or transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDC)
superconductors23,24.
In BiS2-based superconductors,
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) studies asserted
a modulation in the real-space electronic features that are
characterized, for example, by a checkerboard stripe25–27.
These results, however, poses a question if the observed
CDW is an intrinsic bulk property especially since they
also found a large spectroscopic gap of about 40 meV
contrary to a bulk metallic nature25.
Moreover, it has been known from the early stage
that the superconducting transition temperature in BiS2-
based superconductors can be greatly enhanced under
pressure or by pressure annealing8,28.
First-principles
energy calculations show that there is a family of poly-
types nearly-degenerate in energy within ≈1 meV29,30
and x-ray diﬀraction measurement found diﬀerent struc-
tures coexisting in the same batch of crystals31. In-plane
dynamic charge ﬂuctuations and local distortions have
been claimed from neutron and x-ray diﬀraction and the
pair density function analysis32–35.
These ﬁndings all
point to a crucial role of structural instability in under-
standing BiS2-based systems.
Here, we report a long-range CDW ground state that
coexists with superconductivity in NdO0.63F0.37BiS2 ob-

served using high-energy and high-ﬂux x-ray diﬀraction.
The CDW phase onsets around ≈120 K with a wavevec-
tor QCDW = (0.17, 0.17, 0.5). This wavevector is distinct
from the values proposed from either phonon calculation
or Fermi surface evaluation and calls attention to the in-
terlayer couplings neglected in the previous studies. A
detailed study on the x-ray reﬂection pattern shows that
the CDW satellite peaks are stronger along one of the
diagonal directions in the reciprocal (H, K, 0.5) plane,
suggesting one-dimensional and diagonal atomic modula-
tion that breaks 4-fold symmetry. In the NdO0.7F0.3BiS2
with optimal electron doping36, while a similar satel-
lite diﬀraction pattern is observed, the CDW peaks are
broader and weaker suggesting the competition between
superconductivity and charge density wave in this sys-
tem.
Also, the relationship between phonon and su-
perconductivity is investigated by x-ray diﬀuse scatter-
ing measurement. No changes in the phonon frequency
across the superconducting transition temperature, Tc ≈
5 K, are observed.

METHOD
A.
SAMPLE PREPARATION
The single-crystal samples of NdO1−xFxBiS2 (x =
0.3
and
0.37)
were
prepared
as
described
in
the
Ref1,37,38. Samples were synthesized using high temper-
ature CsCl/KCl ﬂux method in a vacuum-sealed quartz
tube with the starting materials of Nd2S3, Bi, Bi2S3,
Bi2O3, BiF3, CsCl, and KCl at approximately 616 ◦C.
The single crystals are ﬂat and plate-like with the c-axis
perpendicular to the growth direction which can be eas-
ily exfoliated due to a Van der Waals gap between the
BiS2 planes25. The typical sample size is about 2 mm
x 2 mm x 0.05 mm. From resistivity measurements, the
transition temperature was determined to be 5.1 K for
x = 0.3 and 5.0 K for x = 0.37. The compositions were
determined by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA).
B.
X-RAY DIFFRACTION
We used a high-energy and high-ﬂux synchrotron x-ray
at the A2 beamline at Cornell High Energy Synchrotron
Source (CHESS). For the x = 0.3 sample, incident en-
ergy, Ei, of 41.75 keV and Pilatus 300 area detector were
used, and the sample was cooled with a closed-cycle re-
frigerator. For the x = 0.37 sample, an Ei = 39.80 keV
was used with other conditions identical. The beam was
slit down to a typical size of 100 x 100 µm. All measure-
ments were performed in transmission geometry taking
advantage of the high ﬂux at high incident energies at
CHESS. Typical reciprocal volume maps are obtained by
combining two sets of 800 images at diﬀerent two-theta
angles with each image having an increment of theta of
0.025◦and counting time 10 seconds.

RESULTS
A high-energy single-crystal x-ray diﬀraction results of
NdO0.63F0.37BiS2 are shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 (a) shows
the intensity map of the reciprocal space plane (H, K) at
L = 0.5 measured at 4 K. While weak in intensity, we
can clearly observe sharp satellite peaks away from the
Bragg peak positions with δq = (0.17, 0.17). Fig. 1 (b)
and (c) shows a magniﬁed view around q = (4, 2) and (4,
0), respectively, for instance. The Bragg reﬂection at the
integer position is surrounded by four satellite reﬂections
which are marked with dashed green circles to make it
clear.
These satellite peaks indicate a periodic lattice
modulation that most likely results from a CDW.
It is intriguing to note that there are lines of diﬀuse
scattering in diagonal directions, reminiscent of the un-
stable phonon modes along the entire Γ-M direction sug-
gested by ab-initio calculations9. See the zoom-in views
Fig. 1 (d) and (e) again around q = (4, 2) and (4, 0), re-
spectively, measured at 120 K where the thermal diﬀuse
scattering intensity is stronger due to the Bose-factor.
The lines of diﬀuse scattering seem to be enhanced on
the line from Γ to satellite peaks. While the unstable
phonon modes are merely an artifact from the calcula-
tion, the soft phonon branch along the entire line should
have an important physical origin9, for example, an ex-
tended collapse of phonon modes due to electron-phonon
coupling that condenses into CDW at low temperature as
in TMDC39. Further energy-resolved phonon dispersion
measurement will be needed to reach a ﬁrm conclusion
on the origin of the thermal diﬀuse scattering line.
Moreover, we notice diﬀerences in the intensities of the
satellite peaks.
For instance, as shown in Fig.
1 (b),
satellite reﬂections around q = (4, 2) are much stronger
along (δ, -δ) direction than along the other diagonal (δ,
δ) direction. Yet, the CDW peaks around (4, 0) all have
comparable intensities, as in Fig. 1 (c).
The intensity of CDW satellite reﬂections can be ex-
pressed as40,41
I(q) ∝

X
α
(q·ϵα)fα(q±QCDW)

2
δ(q−G±QCDW). (1)
Here, ϵα and fα are the atomic displacement and the
structure factor of atom α, respectively, while G is the
reciprocal lattice vector. Considering the (q · ϵα) prefac-
tor, we conclude that the displacement of atom responsi-
ble for the CDW is almost transverse and along diagonal
direction: along (δ, -δ) direction for QCDW = (0.17, 0.17)
and along (δ, δ) direction for QCDW = (0.17, -0.17). The
diﬀraction pattern observed should be understood as an
overlay of two domains, breaking 4-fold symmetry. This
unidirectional modulation is consistent with the quasi-1D
nature expected from small mixing between 6px and 6py
orbitals of Bi ions7.
Figure 1 (f)-(i) show the intensity curves at various
temperatures along diagonal directions around two dif-
ferent Bragg peaks: q = (4, 0) for Fig. 1 (f) and (g) and

except (h) where there is no peak. In ﬁtting the L-dependence, the width of all Gaussian peaks were tied to a same value.
q = (4, 2) for Fig. 1 (h) and (i). At all temperatures,
the satellite reﬂections in Fig. 1 (h) has negligible inten-
sities compared with Fig. 1 (i) due to near-orthogonality
between q and ϵα while the CDW reﬂections around (4,
0) all have similar intensities, Fig. 1 (f) and (g). From
the temperature dependence of the CDW peaks showing
a rapid decrease around 120 K, we expect the onset tem-
perature should be a bit above, but close to 120 K. Future
study on the detailed temperature dependence will be re-
quired to pin down the CDW onset temperature and the
order of phase transition.
A CDW phase has been conjectured from previ-
ous STM studies on BiS2-based superconductors25–27,
though there have been concerns about possible surface
eﬀects and/or sample inhomogeneities. Our x-ray data,
from the sharp width of satellite peaks, demonstrate that
the CDW is indeed a long-range order.
Furthermore,
the transmission geometry ensures that the CDW is a
bulk intrinsic property, rather than a surface reconstruc-
tion. The length of the wavevector, 0.172
√
2a∗, corre-
sponds to about 3.97a (=2.81
√
2a) in real space, con-
sistent with STM results reporting 3a ∼6a in-plane
superstructure25–27.
To check the L-dependence of the CDW satellite peaks,
we made an intensity plot along L-direction at (H, K) =
(4 - 0.17, 0.17) as shown in Fig. 1 (j). Surprisingly, the
intensity is peaked at every half-integer position indicat-
ing doubling of the unit cell along the c-axis. The width
of the peak is ﬁtted with 0.33(1) r.l.u. corresponding to
a correlation length of ≈3 unit cell. Though the broad
width in Q-space suggests a weak and short-ranged inter-
layer correlation, the peak structure is still well-deﬁned.
It is worthy to note that previous phonon studies focused
on the instabilities along q = (δ, δ, 0) direction leading
to a CDW of 2

DFT
calculation also pointed to FSN along the same direction
assuming the 2D character of the Fermi surface7,9,10. Our
data, however, reveals that there is a clear L-dependence
in the CDW reﬂections, indicating interlayer couplings
in NdO0.63F0.37BiS2 superconductors, which places an
important constraint on future studies on the phonon,
CDW, and superconductivity in BiS2-based supercon-
ductors.
We repeated a similar x-ray diﬀraction measurement
on NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 sample to ﬁgure out the doping de-
pendence of CDW. Figure 2 (a) shows the scattering in-

for a hump, possibly from the imperfect crystallinity.
tensity map of (H, K) plane at L = 0.5 measured at
4.3 K. At a ﬁrst glance, we ﬁnd unexpected numer-
ous weak reﬂections at non-integer positions.
We no-
tice that the positions of these reﬂections are not cor-
related with the main Bragg peaks as expected for a
CDW, and therefore cannot be from a superstructure
formation.
It turns out that they are indexed with a
reciprocal basis vectors a∗
1 = (cos(60◦), sin(60◦))a∗/3
and a∗
2 = (cos(60◦), sin(−60◦))a∗/3 (a∗: the original
a-axis reciprocal lattice vector), which are marked with
blue squares in Fig.
2 (b).
This new phase must be
closely linked to the original structure considering that
the lattice parameters are exactly 3 times the original
ones and have a precise 60-degree angle with respect to
the a∗. The hexagonal (or trigonal) reﬂections disappear
when we decrease the beam size to tens of microns and
scan other surface areas. It, therefore, might be induced
from inhomogeneity in the sample, for example, by un-
even doping concentration, defect, vacancy, local strain,
etc. Rough estimation reveals that the volume fraction
of the 3 × 3 phase is about 0.71 ± 0.08 %, negligible
enough to ensure that the composition is close to the
nominal average one42. The L-dependence is not obvious
in this sample due to the imperfect crystallinity along the
c-axis.
Ruling out the contribution from the 3 x 3 phase, we
ﬁnd the satellite reﬂections from the CDW as in Fig. 2 (c)
around q = (4, 2). Again, the polarization dependence of
the CDW satellites is clear and the atomic displacements
should be unidirectional and along diagonal directions.
The L-dependence is also peaked at half-integer positions
consistent with x = 0.37 system.
Furthermore, we notice that the CDW satellite peaks
are slightly broader and weaker compared to those of
NdO0.63F0.37BiS2. Figure 2 (d) and (e) show cuts along
the H and K direction, respectively. The FWHM widths
estimated from Gaussian ﬁts are 0.018(2) r.l.u. along H
and 0.034(2) r.l.u. along K. These values can be com-
pared with those from x = 0.37 sample, 0.014(1) r.l.u.
and 0.017(1) r.l.u. along H and K as shown in Fig. 2
(f) and (g), respectively. The intensity ratio with respect
to the nearby Bragg peak, q = (4, 2), is 1/1597(197)
compared to the ratio of 1/869(91) for x = 0.37. We es-
timated the domain size of the CDW43,44 and obtained
181(8) ˚A for x = 0.37 and 104(9) ˚A for x = 0.345. The
competition of CDW and SC, demonstrated by shorter
CDW domain size and weaker reﬂections for higher su-
perconducting transition temperature, is very similar to
what is observed in cuprates46,47. Considering that x =
0.3 is the optimal doping level with the highest Tc among

NdO1−xFxBiS236, there could be possible competition
between the superconductivity and charge density wave,
though they coexist in current doping range.
To elucidate the relationship between phonon and su-
perconductivity in the BiS2-based superconductors, we
examined the phonon dispersion by observing a thermal
diﬀuse scattering (TDS), a diﬀuse scattering process by
lattice thermal vibration. For a phonon-mediated con-
ventional superconductor, there can be a phonon fre-
quency softening and/or line-width broadening at a mo-
mentum transfer q = 2kF across the superconducting
phase transition48–53.
To the 1st order, the intensity of TDS by unpolarized
x-ray at a momentum transfer q can be represented as54

where the subscripts s and j represent the atom in a
unit cell and the phonon modes, respectively. Here, ω,
e, f, µ, e−M, and τ refer to phonon frequency, eigen-
vector for the phonon mode, atomic form factor, atomic
mass, the Debye-Waller factor, and basis vector in real
space, respectively. From this equation, we can tell that
the main contribution to the TDS intensity will be from
the low lying phonon modes, where signiﬁcant electron-
phonon couplings have been estimated in BiS2-based su-
perconductors.
In addition, from the coth-dependence
with 1/T, we expect the thermal change of intensity will
be negligible in the small temperature range around Tc.
Figure 3 (a) shows some representative intensity maps
in the (H, K, 0) plane measured at 4.3, 5.5, 8.0, and 10 K.
We were not able to observe any meaningful q-dependent
or T-dependent changes in the TDS. For more careful in-
spection, we plot intensity curves along several directions,
for example, along diagonal (δ, -δ) and horizontal (δ, 0)
directions in Fig. 3 (b). No clear and consistent change
is found across Tc while some anomalous kink can be at-
tributed to the 3 x 3 phase. It should be noted that TDS
intensity is an energy-integrated measurement and it is
always possible that a small thermal population at low
temperature and/or not-enough x-ray ﬂux may hinder
the observation of a small phonon anomaly. With these
limitations in mind, we conclude it is likely that the the
change of phonon frequency across the superconducting
phase transition is small to be detected.

DISCUSSION
Here we report that NdO1−xFxBiS2 (x = 0.37 and 0.3)
develops a CDW, a long-sought structural ground state
in the BiS2-based superconductors that coexist with su-
perconductivity. The origin of a CDW is an interesting
and often challenging question. It can be from FSN as in
simple Pierels system, q-dependent electron-phonon cou-
pling as in some TMDC, or electron-electron correlation
in cuprates55. While the QCDW seems to be far from the
FSN vectors known so far, electron-phonon coupling cal-
culations were not successful to predict the wavevector
yet. More careful studies considering the interlayer cou-
plings and even electronic correlations could be required.
The discrepancy between the calculations and mea-
surements might be from the structural instability to the
monoclinic phase in the BiS2-based system. At high pres-
sure, LaO1−xFxBiS2 undergoes a structural phase tran-
sition to P21/m and yields higher Tc28.
According to
the ﬁrst-principle calculations, in the monoclinic phase,
the magnitude of the interlayer hopping becomes much
larger stabilizing the electronic state56,57. Our intensity
map at (H, K, 0) in the Supplementary show that the x-
ray reﬂections no longer satisfy the P4/nmm extinction
conditions, probably due to a monoclinic phase transition
as observed in some other BiS2-based systems58.
The
enhanced interlayer hopping in the monoclinic structure,
therefore, can be responsible for the L-dependence of our
CDW wavevector. We claim that the interlayer coupling
overlooked so far in the phonon and band calculations
can be essential to properly describe the electron-phonon

coupling, FSN, CDW, and the nature of superconductiv-
ity in BiS2-based superconductors.
Lastly, the role of CDW in superconductivity has been
an active research subject since Fr¨ohlich tried to explain
superconductivity with sliding of CDW, a concept con-
ceived even before BCS formalism59.
While there is
accumulating evidence that a CDW could be a ubiqui-
tous phase in unconventional superconductors23,24, the
relation with superconductivity remains elusive.
Here,
we suggested that the charge density wave and su-
perconductivity might be in competition while coexist-
ing over a certain doping range in the phase diagram.
Like lattice vibrations in a conventional superconduc-
tor, charge/orbital ﬂuctuation near the quantum criti-
cal point is argued to be capable of mediating supercon-
ductivity. Considering the absence of momentum- and
temperature- dependent anomalies in the phonon spec-
trum across Tc, we cannot exclude the unconventional
pairing mechanism. The study on the interplay between
CDW and superconductivity in BiS2-based superconduc-
tors, by changing external perturbations like doping or
pressure will be a fascinating topic that requires lots of
future attention.

CONCLUSION
In summary, we found an intrinsic and long-range
CDW phase in a NdO1−xFxBiS2 (x = 0.37 and 0.3) su-
perconductor by x-ray diﬀraction measurements.
The
CDW wavevector is QCDW ≈(0.17, 0.17, 0.5) with clear
L-dependence and the atomic displacements are trans-
verse and in diagonal directions. The wavevector does
not match theoretical estimations from phonon soften-
ing or FSN and therefore places an important constraint
on forthcoming studies. We measured TDS across the
Tc and could not ﬁnd meaningful q- and T- dependent
changes.
