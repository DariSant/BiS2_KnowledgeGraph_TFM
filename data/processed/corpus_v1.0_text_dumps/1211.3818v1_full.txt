By means of first-principles calculations, we have probed the peculiarities of the 
electronic band structure and Fermi surface for the recently discovered layered 
superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 in comparison with the parent phase LaOBiS2. The 
electronic factors promoting the transition of LaOBiS2 upon fluorine doping to 
superconducting state: inter-layer charge transfer, the evolution of the Fermi surface, and 
the dependence of the near-Fermi densities of states on x for LaO1−xFxBiS2 are evaluated 
and discussed in comparison with the available experiments.

     The superconducting materials with layered structures attract currently much attention 
owing to a set of intriguing physical properties related to unconventional mechanisms of 
superconductivity. The most popular materials among them are now Fe-pnictogen (Pn) 
and Fe-chalcogen (Ch) based compounds, which form the groups of so-called 11, 111, 
122, 1111, 23335, 42226, and more complex phases, reviews [1-7]. These materials are 
composed of superconducting blocks [FePn] or [FeCh], which are separated by so-called 
spacer blocks. In all these systems, which possess remarkable chemical flexibility, 
success in increasing the critical temperature TC was achieved mainly by optimization of 
the structural parameters and (or) via changes in the carrier doping levels.  
     The very recent discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 (TC ~ 4.5 K) [8-11] and 
then in several related BiS2-based systems (LaO1−xFxBiS2, CeO1−xFxBiS2, PrO1−xFxBiS2, 
and NdO1−xFxBiS2, with TC ~ 10.0 K [12], 3.0 K [13], 5.5 K [14], and 5.6 K [15], 


 
2
respectively), which contain identical blocks [BiS2], has opened the next stage in the field 
of modern layered superconductors and provided a new research domain of physics for 
such systems.  
      It is remarkable is that among all BiS2-based superconductors (SCs) discovered so 
far, the maximum TC (~10 K) is achieved for La(O,F)BiS2, i.e. at electron doping of the 
parent semiconducting phase LaOBiS2 via partial replacement of oxygen by fluorine 
[12,16-18]. Thus, these newest layered BiS2-based SCs, like the aforementioned Fe-
(Pn,Ch) systems, are very sensitive to the carrier doping level, when atomic substitutions 
cause profound changes in their properties, and superconductivity appears in the vicinity 
of the insulating-like state. Note also that a non-monotonic change of TC was achieved by 
doping of the oxide blocks [LaO], which act as spacer blocks, when for LaO1−xFxBiS2 
superconductivity appears at x = 0.2, grows with further F-doping, and reaches TC ~10 K 
at x = 0.5, and then it is gradually suppressed and disappears at x = 0.7. 
     From the theoretical standpoint, for the family of BiS2-based SCs, the available band 
structure calculations [8,19-21] reveal that for Bi4O4S3 in the window around the Fermi 
level (EF) the main contributions come from the Bi 6px,y orbitals, which are the most 
active pairing states [8]; on the other hand, LaOBiS2 belongs to band insulators [16,19]. 
Using the band structure of LaOBiS2, H. Usui et al. [19] have constructed a minimal 
electronic model for superconducting LaO1−xFxBiS2, and declared a good nesting of the 
Fermi surface (FS) at around x ~ 0.5. Very recently, Li and Xing [20] have calculated the 
electron-phonon coupling constant for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (λ = 0.8) and concluded that this 
material is a conventional electron-phonon SC. On the other hand, Yildirim [21] found 
that LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 possesses rather unusual structural and dynamical properties and is a 
strong electron-phonon coupled SC in the vicinity of competing ferroelectric and charge 
density wave (CDW) phases, when large-amplitude in-plane displacements of sulfur 
atoms control the structural properties and give rise to large electron-phonon coupling. 
     In view of these circumstances, in this Letter we present detailed calculations of the 
band structure and FS for the newest SC LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 - in comparison with the parent 
phase LaOBiS2. Besides, using the obtained electronic structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 we 
discuss the changes in the near-Fermi density of states (DOSs) and in the FS topology for 
LaO1−xFxBiS2 in the doping interval 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 - in comparison with available 
experiments. 
     We began with the parent tetragonal phase LaOBiS2, which adopts the space group 
P4/nmm with lattice parameters a = 4.05 Å and c =13.74 Å [19]. This phase possesses a 
layered structure composed of blocks [LnO] and [BiS2], which are stacked in the 
sequence …[LnO]/[BiS2]/[LnO]/[BiS2]/… as depicted in Fig. 1. After that we considered 
the fluorine-doped system with the formal stoichiometry LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, for which the 
maximal TC was found [12,16-18]. Here the experimentally obtained [12] lattice 
parameters (a = 4.0527 Å and c = 13.3237 Å) and atomic coordinates La: (0.5, 0, 
0.1015); Bi: (0.5, 0, 0.6231); S1: (0.5, 0, 0.3657); S2: (0.5, 0, 0.8198); O/F (with 
occupancy 0.5/0.5): (0, 0, 0), were used. Note that the substitution of F-1 for O-2 leads to 
an anisotropic deformation of the lattice, when the parameter a remains almost invariable 
(in comparison with the parent phase LaOBiS2), whereas the parameter c becomes 
compressed by 3 %; and this situation is typical of layered phases at atomic substitutions, 
reviews [1-7]. 
    Our calculations were performed by means of the full-potential method within mixed 
basis APW+lo (FLAPW) implemented in the WIEN2k suite of programs [22]. The 
generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to exchange-correlation potential [23] was 


 
3
used. The densities of states (DOSs) were obtained by the modified tetrahedron method 
[24]. 
      The band structure, the total, atomic, and orbital decomposed partial densities of 
states for the parent phase LaOBiS2 are depicted in Figs. 2 and 3. We see that the valence 
band (VB, in the energy interval from -5.6 eV to the Fermi level) consists mainly of the p 
states of O and S atoms; the contributions of the valence orbitals of La and Bi are much 
smaller. The VB is separated from the conduction band (CB) by a gap indicating an 
insulating behavior of LaOBiS2. The minimal indirect gap (Z - R transition) is estimated 
at about 0.4 eV. Note that the bottom of the CB for LaOBiS2 is formed mainly by 
unoccupied Bi 6p states with admixtures of S 3p states; thus at electron doping, these 
states are expected to be filled. 
      Our calculations reveal that for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, in comparison with LaOBiS2, the 
Fermi level is displaced upwards and intersects six bands along Z-R, X-M and A-Z high-
symmetry directions of the Brillouin zone (BZ), which form the electronic pockets of the 
FS. Thus, partial substitution of fluorine for oxygen leads to a metallic-like behavior of 
the cubic LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, where the carriers are electrons, see Figs. 2 and 3. 
     Generally, it is quite an expected result, since for oxides, fluorine with one additional 
electron compared to oxygen may be considered as a “universal” electron dopant, which, 
owing to injection of additional electrons, changes the insulating oxides to metallic 
conductors or superconductors. For example, superconductivity was found at fluorine 
doping in simple insulating oxides such as WO3, see [25,26].  
    However for the discussed LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 the situation became more complicated: as 
can be seen from the DOSs picture (Fig. 3), though fluorine doping occurs in the spacer 
blocks [LnO], the main effect of metallization takes place for the neighbor blocks [BiS2], 
which are involved in the formation of the superconducting state. At the same time, the 
semiconducting spectrum of the oxide blocks (for LaOBiS2) is transformed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 into a spectrum typical of so-called “bad metals”, with very low densities 
of states at the Fermi level.  
     This effect may be explained taking into account the charge distributions between the 
adjacent blocks: [LnO]/[BiS2]. For LaOBiS2, assuming the usual oxidation numbers of 
atoms: La3+, Bi3+, O2-, and S3-, the simple ionic formula should be: (La3+O2-)1+(Bi3+S2-
2)1-; 
this implies that the charge transfer between the adjacent blocks is equal: [LnO] →[BiS2] 
= le, and the blocks [LnO] act as “charge reservoirs”. To estimate the effective atomic 
charges (Qeff) numerically, we carried out a Bader [27] analysis. For LaOBiS2, the values 
of Qeff are: (La1.990+O1.271-)0.719+(Bi2.020+S(1)
1.022-S(2)
1.717-)0.719- (here S(1)
 and S(2) denote the 
non-equivalent S atoms in blocks [BiS2], see [12,16-18]) and the charge transfer [LnO] 
→[BiS2] is about 0.7e. The  reduction of the effective charges (in comparison with the 
ideal ionic model) is due to the overlapping of the valence states and to the formation of 
covalent bonds, see Fig. 3. 
     For LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, the values of Qeff are: (La2.012+O1.278-
0.5F0.794-
0.5)0.976+(Bi1.728+S(1)
1.099-
S(2)
1.606-)0.976-, i.e. fluorine doping of the parent phase increases the charge transfer to the 
blocks [BiS2] by about 0.26 e, promoting the aforementioned primary metallization of 
these blocks. 
     Coming back to the electronic properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, let us discuss in greater 
detail the near-Fermi bands, which are involved in the formation of the superconducting 
state. From the atomic and orbital decomposed DOSs depicted in Fig. 3 it is seen that the 
main contribution to this region comes from the Bi 6p states, with additions of the S 3p 
states. Numerically, the contributions to the total DOS at the Fermi level, Ntot(EF), are: 


 
4
NBi6p(EF) =  0.423  1/eV∙form. unit and NS3p(EF) =  0.2087  1/eV∙form. unit. In turn, for 
the Bi 6p states, the main contributions are from the in-plane Bi 6px,y orbitals within the 
blocks [BiS2]: NBi6p
x(EF) =  0.206  1/eV∙form. unit, NBi6p
y(EF) =  0.207  1/eV∙form. unit – 
in comparison with out-of-plane Bi 6pz orbitals: NBi6p
z(EF) =  0.010  1/eV∙form. unit. The 
calculated value of Ntot(EF) for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 allows us to estimate the Sommerfeld 
constant (γ) under the assumption of the free electron model as γ = (π2/3)N(EF)k2
B. The 
calculated γ = 3.3 mJ∙K-2∙mol-1 agrees reasonably with earlier estimations: γ = 3.0 mJ∙K-
2∙mol-1 [20]. 
        The authors [18] noticed that the dome-shaped dependence of TC on x for 
LaO1−xFxBiS2 (with maximal TC ~ 10 K for x=0.5) resembles the x dependence of the 
lattice parameter a, therefore the structural factor should be important for 
superconductivity in these materials.  
        On the other hand, to evaluate the role of the electronic factor, we probed the x 
dependence of Ntot(EF). For this purpose, we varied the electronic concentration, 
simulating (in the framework of the rigid band model) the doping level in LaO1−xFxBiS2 
in the range 0.2 < x < 0.7. 
      The calculated changes in Ntot(EF) are plotted in Fig. 4 together with the experimental 
phase diagram of LaO1−xFxBiS2 [18]. We see quite a similar dome-shaped dependence of 
Ntot(EF) on x with the maximal Ntot(EF) for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Thus our calculations show 
that together with the structural factor [18], the electronic factor provides the transition of 
LaOBiS2 into the superconducting state upon fluorine doping, and it should be 
responsible for the regulation of the observed x dependence of TC for LaO1−xFxBiS2. 
    Finally, let us discuss the Fermi surface for the superconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and the 
evolution of its topology depending on the doping level. For LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, the Fermi 
surface adopts a 2D-like topology (which is typical of layered SCs, reviews [1-7]) and 
comprises a set of disconnected cylinders extended along the kz direction, Fig. 1. Two of 
them are along the Г-Z direction, the other two are in the corners of the BZ (along the M-
A direction), and the rest two small cylinder-like sheets are on the lateral faces of the BZ 
(along the X-R direction). Next, in Fig. 5 we present a set of FSs for LaO1−xFxBiS2 across 
the doping level. We see that in all the cases the FSs retain the quasi-two-dimensional 
type, but their shapes change essentially depending on the band occupancy (doping 
level). So at an initial stage of doping (x=0.2), the FS contains only two electron-like 
sheets in the BZ lateral sides. With an increase in the band occupancy, the volume of the 
Fermi surface gradually increases, but the shape is retained (x=0.3). Visible 
reconstruction of the FS occurs for x ~ 0.4, when the disconnected sheets on the lateral 
sides of the BZ became merged, and new small sheets (along X-R) appear. At the highest 
doping level (x ≥ 0.5), the next stage of reconstruction occurs, when the FS adopts the 
form described earlier for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
     In summary, using first-principles calculations we examined the electronic band 
structure and the Fermi surface for the very recently discovered superconductor 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 in comparison with the parent band insulator LaOBiS2 and determined the 
key electronic factors promoting the superconducting transition for the fluorine-doped 
LaOBiS2 and the TC dependence on x for LaO1−xFxBiS2. According to our data, the main 
factors at fluorine doping are: (i) the increase of the charge transfer between adjacent 
blocks [LnO]→[BiS2] related to metallization of superconducting blocks [BiS2]; (ii) the 
dome-shaped dependence of Ntot(EF) on x related to the regulation of the values of TC, 
and (iii) the reconstruction of the 2D-like Fermi surface, which is related to the nesting 
effect.
