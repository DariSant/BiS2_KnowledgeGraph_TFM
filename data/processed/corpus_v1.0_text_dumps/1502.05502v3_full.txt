We report bulk superconductivity at 2.5K in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound through the DC 
magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements. The synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 
compound is crystallized in tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm and Reitveld refined 
lattice parameters are a= 4.15(1)Å and c=14.02(2)Å.  The lower critical field of Hc1= 40Oe, at 
temperature 2K is estimated through the low field magnetization measurements. The 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound showed metallic normal state electrical resistivity with residual 
resistivity value of 1.35mΩ-cm. The compound is type-II superconductor, and the estimated 
Hc2(0) value obtained by WHH formula is above 20kOe for 90%ρn criteria. The superconducting 
transition temperature decreases with applied pressure till around 1.68GPa and with further 
higher pressures a high Tc phase emerges with possible onset Tc of above 5K for 2.5GPa.

INTRODUCTION  
The recent discovery of BiS2 based materials with layered structure have been studied in 
past couple of years as a potential approach to the exploration of new superconductors. The 
novel BiS2 based superconductivity has been reported first in Bi4O4S3 layered compound with Tc 


value of 4.5K [1, 2].  Bi4O4S3 is composed of Bi2O2(SO4)(1−x) (x=0.5) blocking layers and BiS2 
superconducting layers [1]. Consequently, other BiS2-based superconductors were discovered, 
including ReO1−xFxBiS2 (Re= La, Ce, Nd, Yb, Pr), La1−xMxOBiS2 (M= Ti, Zr, Hf, Th), and 
Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 [3-10]. The highest Tc=10.6 K has been obtained for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconductors under hydrostatic pressure [11]. In particular, the Tc of REO1−xFxBiS2 (RE=La, 
Ce, Nd, Pr) [11–14] and Sr1−xRExFBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm) systems, enhances 
tremendously by applying the hydrostatic pressure [15, 16]. As far as the chemical substitutions 
are concerned the doping of Se on the S site in the Bi4O4S3-xSex and NdOFBiS2-xSex 
superconductors showed the suppression in Tc [17, 18]. Interestingly, the superconductivity at 
2.5K in BiSe2 based layered LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 polycrystalline compound has recently been 
reported by A. Krzton-Maziopa, at. el, [19].  The crystal structure of the superconducting oxy-
selenide is similar to other layered superconducting compounds such as CuO based cuprates and 
iron-based Pnictides with alternating stacks of blocking and superconducting layers [19]. Soon 
after this report, superconductivity with Tc value of 3.0K was reported in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 single 
crystals [20]. Also, the theoretical approaches were applied, and it was shown that the electronic 
structure, lattice dynamics, and electron–phonon interaction of the newly discovered 
superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 is that same as that for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [21]. The 
pressure effect on LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 single crystals showed a decrease in Tc with applied pressure 
of up to 1.75GPa and obtained high Tc phase (6K) for higher pressure (> 1.97GPa) [22]. This is 
strikingly different than the impact of hydrostatic pressure on similar structure oxy-sulfides, 
where Tc increases profoundly with pressure [11-16]. The external pressure effect is a 
conventional method for structural modulation that is often used to change the superconducting 
Tc. For example, the increase in Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound under pressure is due to a 
structural phase transition from tetragonal phase (P4/nmm) to monoclinic phase (P21/m) [23].  
Here we report the successful synthesis of polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound 
through the solid state reaction method. The compound is crystallized in the tetragonal structure 
with space group P4/nmm. The bulk superconductivity at 2.5K has been observed through DC 
magnetic and electrical resistivity measurements. Because a positive pressure effect on Tc has 
also been reported for BiS2-based polycrystalline superconducting compounds [11-16] therefore 
we decided to determine the hydrostatic pressure effect on Tc of polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 


compound. We applied hydrostatic pressure on the polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound, 
and found that Tc decreases with increasing applied pressure till around 1.68GPa and a high Tc 
phase emerges at higher applied pressure of 2.5GPa with possible onset Tc at around 5K. It is 
interesting to note that the impact of pressure on superconductivity of currently studied BiSe2 is 
dramatically different to that as for BiS2 ones [11-16]. Our results are qualitatively similar with 
the only available recent report [22] on impact of pressure on superconductivity of single 
crystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2.    
EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS  
The polycrystalline bulk LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 sample was synthesized by standard solid state 
reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity (4N) La, Bi, Se, LaF3, and La2O3 are 
weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box in high purity argon 
atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-4 mbar) in a 
quartz tube. The box furnace has been used to sinter the samples at 7800C for 12h with the 
typical heating rate of 2oC/min. The sintered sample is subsequently cooled down slowly to room 
temperature. This process has been repeated two times. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed 
at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-80o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o 
using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed using the 
standard FullProf program. DC magnetic susceptibility and transport measurements were 
performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-140kOe, Quantum Design).  
The electrical resistivity under hydrostatic pressure measurements were carried out on 
Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-140kOe, Quantum Design) by using HPC-33 
Piston type pressure cell. Hydrostatic pressures were generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped 
piston-cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a fluid (Daphne Oil) pressure transmitting 
medium in a Teflon cell. Annealed Pt wires were affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces on 
each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-wire configuration.  
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
 
Figure 1(a) demonstrates the room temperature observed and Rietveld fitted XRD pattern 
of polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound. The compound is crystallized in tetragonal 
structure with the space group P4/nmm. Lattice parameters being obtained from Rietveld 


refinement of XRD are a= 4.15(1)Å and c=14.02(2)Å, which are in good agreement with earlier 
reports on LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound [19]. Small impurity peak of Bi2Se3 has also been seen and 
is marked as (*) in Figure 1, which is close to the background of the XRD pattern. The unit cell 
of the LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound is shown in figure 1(b). The compound has layered structure; 
including (LaO)2 (Rare earth oxide) and BiSe2 layers. Different atoms like Bismuth (Bi), 
Lanthanum (La), and Selenium (Se1 and Se2) occupy the 2c (0.25, 0.25, z) site, while the O/F 
atoms are at 2a (0.75, 0.25, 0) site. Interestingly, the carrier doping mechanism is same as Iron 
based compound LaFeAsO/F [24], where the carriers are doped from LaO/F to superconducting 
FeAs layer. Similarly, in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, mobile carriers are doped from LaO/F redox layer to 
superconducting BiSe2 layer.  
Figure 2 depict the temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibility measurements in 
Zero Field Cool (ZFC) and Field Cool (FC) protocols for the LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound under 
10Oe magnetic field. The bulk superconductivity is confirmed as diamagnetic signal below 
superconducting transition with an onset Tc at 2.5K, whereas the field-cooled susceptibility 
exhibits only a small drop, possibly due to a strong flux pinning effect. Inset of the figure 2 
illustrates the lower critical field Hc1(T) in low field isothermal magnetization (MH) 
measurements.  The initial flux penetration and the deviation from linearity within the Meissner 
state defines the Hc1(T). The lower critical field of studied LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound is 40Oe at 
temperature 2K. 
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 
compound in the temperature range 2K and 300K. The normal state electrical resistivity behavior 
is metallic and comparable to the Bi4O4S3 superconductor [1, 2]. The metallic behavior of normal 
state electrical resistivity has also been seen in BiS2 based polycrystalline Sr1−xRExFBiS2 (RE= 
La, Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm) systems but under high pressure measurement [15, 16]. Interestingly, the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound shows the metallic behavior at ambient pressure itself, which is well 
fitted to the resistivity linear equation ρ=ρo+ AT, where ρo is the residual resistivity and A is the 
slope of the graph. Fitting of the ρ(T) graph shows as red line in the temperature range 300K-
50K in figure 3a and obtained residual resistivity value is 1.35mΩ-cm.  The obtained value of 
residual resistivity is slightly higher than the one as reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound 
earlier [19], suggesting possible inhomogeneity in our sample. The superconducting transition is 


clearly seen below Tc onset of around 2.8 K, see inset of figure 3. The normal state 
semiconducting behavior of similar superconductor REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound has earlier been 
seen in many reports [3-10], which is quite different from metallic character of resistivity of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound. Inset of the figure 3 shows the electrical resistivity under various 
magnetic fields in superconducting transition temperature region.  The Tc onset and Tc (ρ=0) of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound shift towards the low temperature side with applied magnetic field. It 
is the clear indication of type-II superconductivity like high Tc cuprate and Iron based Pnictides 
superconductors. Figure 4 shows the upper critical field (Hc2) corresponding to the temperatures 
where the resistivity drops to 90% of the normal state resistivity. The Hc2(0) is estimated by 
using the conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation, i.e., 
Hc2(0)=-0.693Tc(dHc2/dT)T=Tc. The solid line is the result of fitting of Hc2(T) to the WHH 
formula. The estimated Hc2(0) is above 20kOe for 90%, ρn criteria. 
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for the polycrystalline 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound at various hydrostatic pressures with temperatures ranging from 2K 
to 250K. The normal state resistivity of compound is metallic at ambient pressure as well in 
hydrostatic pressure of up to 2.5GPa.  Interestingly, the normal state resistivity first decreases 
with increasing pressure up to 1.97GPa and then slightly increases for 2.20Gpa and 2.50GPa 
with still having a metallic character. Inset of figure 5 shows enlarged views of the 
superconducting transition region in the temperature range 6-2K under various pressures for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 compound. It can be clearly seen that the Tc at ambient pressure gradually 
decreases with increasing pressure. Interestingly, a high Tc phase emerges at applied pressure 
above 2GPa with maximum possible onset Tc of around 5K for 2.5GPa pressure.  Interestingly, 
we did not obtained Tc(ρ=0) for the high Tc (5K onset) phase.  The Superconducting transition 
Tc(ρ=0) may occur for the higher applied pressures as observed in a previous report for the same 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 single crystalline compound [22].  
Interestingly, Tc increases monotonically with applying pressure on BiS2-based similar 
structure superconductors [11-16]. This is clear dissimilarity between the presently studied 
BiSe2-based superconductors and the by now widely studied BiS2-based ones, particularly the 
REO1−xFxBiS2 and Sr1−xRExFBiS2 [11-16]. It has been suggested the increase in the 
superconducting Tc with increasing pressure for polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is due 


to structural phase transition from a tetragonal phase (P4/nmm) to a monoclinic phase (P21/m) 
[23].  However, by examining available data (ref. 22, and the present results) on the relative 
pressure effect on the Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductor, clearly negative dTc/dP is seen for 
low pressures of up to say 2GPa, and later a high Tc (5K) phase appears for higher pressures.  
The decrease in the superconducting transition with applied low applied pressures (<2GPa) 
seems to be due to possible over doping, as the normal state resistivity decreases in this regime. 
Later for higher pressures of above 2GPa, the high Tc phase might be appearing with a new 
crystal structure as seen for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [22].  The under pressure structural details 
at various temperatures for the studied LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductor are strictly warranted, 
before commenting on real cause of the anomalous pressure dependence of superconducting 
transition temperature (Tc) of the same.  
CONCLUSION:  
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized the polycrystalline LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 
compound in single phase with superconductivity (Tc) at above 2.8K in both magnetic and 
electrical resistivity measurements. The estimated Hc2(0) value of the compound is above 20kOe. 
The Tc of the compound first decreases with applied pressure till around 1.68GPa and for higher 
pressures a high Tc phase emerges with possible onset Tc of above 5K for 2.5GPa. The impact of 
hydrostatic pressure on the presently studied LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 is much different than the widely 
studied LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. Structural details under pressure for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 are 
much warranted.
