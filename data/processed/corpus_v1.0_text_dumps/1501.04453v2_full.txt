Abstract 
The recently discovered layered BiS2-based superconductors have attracted a 
great deal of interest due to their structural similarity to cuprate and iron-pnictide 
superconductors. We have performed Raman scattering measurements on two 
superconducting crystals NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc = 4.5 K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (Tc = 4.8 K). 
The observed Raman phonon modes are assigned with the aid of first-principles 
calculations. The asymmetrical phonon mode around 118 cm-1 reveals a small 
electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling constant  ~ 0.16, which is insufficient to generate 
superconductivity at ~ 4.5 K. In the Raman spectra there exists a clear 
temperature-dependent hump around 100 cm-1, which can be well understood in term 
of inter-band vertical transitions around Fermi surface. The transitions get boosted 
when the particular rectangular-like Fermi surface meets band splitting caused by 
spin-orbit coupling. It enables a unique and quantitative insight into the band splitting.

Introduction 
The discovery of BiS2-based superconductors has inspired a new wave of 
research1-5. Analogous to cuprate and iron-pnictide superconductors, the new 
superconductors have two-dimensional conducting BiS2 layers as key building blocks, 
which are considered to be responsible for superconductivity (SC). Actually the 
BiS2-based compounds are very similar to FeSe superconductors in structure and 
exhibit semiconducting behavior at low temperatures6, 7. As the most common 
elementary excitations in solids, lattices vibrations are vital to study some 
fundamental physical properties and interactions, such as mechanical and thermal 
properties, electron-phonon coupling and other phonon-involved scattering processes. 
Phonon dispersion in the materials has been initially studied by neutron scattering8. 
And Raman measurements have also been made recently9. However, a comprehensive 
assignment of the observed Raman modes is still lacking. Furthermore, many key 
electronic properties, such as e-ph coupling and low-energy excitations, are waiting to 
be unraveled by Raman scattering and other optical methods. 
The electronic properties of REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = rare earth) compounds have 
received many theoretical and experimental investigations. 
First-principles 
calculations predicted a Fermi surface showing a nesting along (π，π，0）direction at 
half filling. This may induce phonon instability or charge density wave (CDW), which 
implies that superconductivity in the BiS2 system may be driven by strong e-ph 
coupling10-12. Actually no sign of CDW transition was observed by infrared optical 
spectroscopy13, and neutron scattering measurements show no significant change in 
phonon density cross the SC transition8. Rectangular-like Fermi pockets around X 
points have been revealed by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) 
experiments. The measured band filling is smaller than the calculated one, against the 
picture of Fermi surface nesting14, 15. The pairing mechanism in the BiS2-based 
superconductors is still under debate and requires further theoretical and experimental 
studies.  


Due to the particular rectangular-like Fermi surface, the delicate electronic 
structure around Fermi surface becomes crucial to the understanding of electronic 
properties of BiS2-based compounds. A multi-band or shallow band-edge effect, 
observed by Hall measurements, seems to be related to SC pairing in the 
CeO1−xFxBiS2
16. And ARPES has observed a band splitting due to spin-orbit coupling 
(SOC) in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2
14. Probing low-energy excitations around Fermi surface is 
still a one of the key issues in BiS2-based superconductors and is highly desired. 
In this work, we have performed Raman scattering experiments on SC single 
crystals NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc=4.5K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (Tc=4.8K). The observed 
Raman modes are assigned with the assistance of first-principles calculations. The A1g 
mode at 118 cm-1 exhibits an asymmetrical lineshape which is attributed to 
Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) resonance (or Fano resonance) driven by e-ph coupling17, 
18. The fitting of Fano lineshape gives the strength of e-ph coupling constant ~ 0.16, 
which gives a near-zero Tc using the density of states (DOS) at Fermi surface N (EF) 
derived from electronic specific heat coefficient19. This may suggest that the paring 
glue in the BiS2 system is beyond e-ph coupling. Furthermore, the rectangular-like 
Fermi surface plus band splitting due to SOC, enhances the inter-band vertical 
transitions around Fermi surface. The transitions give rise to a clear 
temperature-dependent electronic hump in cross-polarization Raman channel, which 
allows a quantitative study on band splitting. 
 
Experiments and methods 
Superconducting single crystals NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc = 4.5 K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 
(Tc = 4.8 K) were grown using KCl flux and the details of crystal growth and 
characterization can be found elsewhere20, 21. The sample size is typically about 
0.5×0.5×0.1 mm. The crystals can be easily cleaved to obtain flat and shining ab 
planes. To exclude possible impurity effect on surface, we have repeated the cleavage 
for the crystals at least two times before they were placed into the cryostat. For each 
cleavage, Raman spectra were recorded and compared. And no sign of impurity is

seen in the spectra (Supplementary materials). It is in agreement with the reported 
structural characterizations7. Raman measurements were performed in a high-vacuum 
closed-cycle cryostat with anti-vibration design (10~300 K, ~10-8 mbar).Raman 
spectra were collected with a HR800 spectrometer (Jobin Yvon) equipped with liquid 
nitrogen cooled CCD and volume Bragg gratings and micro-Raman backscattering 
configuration was adopted. A 632.8 nm laser was used with a spot of ~5 microns 
focused on sample surface, and the laser power less than 1 mW was sustained during 
measurements to avoid overheating. 
In order to identify the Raman active modes found in experiments, we had carried 
out first-principles calculations by using the QUANTUM-ESPRESSO (QE)

experimental mode frequencies are listed below each pattern. 
 
package22. The ultra-soft pseudopotentials23 were employed to describe the 
electron-ion interactions. The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of 
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) 24 formalism was adopted for the exchange and 
correlation functional. The kinetic energy cutoff and the charge density cutoff for the 
plane-wave basis were 800 eV and 8000 eV, respectively. For the Brillouin-zone 
integration, the k points were sampled on a 12X12X4 grid. The Fermi surface was 
broadened using the gaussian smearing technique with a width of 0.05 eV. 
Variable-cell calculations were performed until zero pressure was reached and all of 
the forces acting on atoms were less than 0.01 eV/Å. 
 
Results and discussions 
I. Assignments of Raman modes 
Low-temperature Raman spectra of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 are shown 


in Fig. 1. The spectra exhibit a high similarity between both crystals in peak position 
and shape. This implies that the actual composition of the two samples may be very 
close though their nominal fluorine contents seem quite different. It is in accord with 
the fact that both crystals have very close SC transition temperatures. Symmetry 
analysis shows that there are ten Raman-active modes (4A1g+B1g+5Eg) at gamma 
point. The corresponding vibration patterns are illustrated in Fig. 2. The observed 
Raman modes are well assigned in combination with first-principles calculations as 
shown in Fig. 2. And the calculated phonon energies are close to those from Ref. 8 
and summarized in Table I. 
Among the observed Raman modes, the two peaks located at 70 cm-1 and 117.5 
cm-1, only visible in parallel polarization channel, are identified as A1g symmetry. The 
2A1g phonon mode exhibits a clear asymmetric lineshape, indicating an obvious e-ph 
coupling. A broad low-frequency hump in cross polarization channel is observed in 
both samples. We leave detailed discussions on them in the following sections. The 
small peaks around 38 cm-1 and 79 cm-1 in cross channel, is attributed to Eg modes 
according to first-principles calculations (see Table. 1). The modes are normally 
prohibited in the present scattering geometry but may leak into the measurements on 
ab planes, perhaps due to a slight tilt of sample surface. There are two unidentified  
 
Table I Assignments of the observed Raman modes. The calculated phonon frequencies of 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 are in good agreement with experiments. S1 and S2 denote sulfur atoms in BiS 
plane and out of plane, respectively. (See Fig. 2)

tiny peaks in cross channel. One is the peak around 111.5 cm-1 (marked by #) which 
can be reasonably attributed to intensity leakage of the strongest 2A1g mode in parallel 
channel. And the other peak at 56 cm-1 (marked by *),may be a leakage of 
Raman-inactive mode. Actually around the energy, a peak of phonon density of states 
has been observed by neutron scattering measurements.8 The 2Eg and B1g modes come 
from the cooperative vibrations of O/F atoms. Both modes seem clearly boarder than 
others. This is consistent with O/F disorder. 
 
II. Electron-phonon coupling 
The temperature dependence of the two strongest phonon peaks, 1A1g and 2A1g, is 
depicted in Fig. 3. Both modes indicate a smooth temperature evolution and no 
observable anomalies are seen in the temperature range of 10 to 300 K. However, 
their line shapes are clearly different. 1A1g mode is a well-defined Lorentzian-type 
peak, while on the other hand, 2A1g displays an asymmetric Fano-like shape (see

and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (b&d). The red curves are anharmonic fittings using formula (1).  
 
below). The fitting curves using symmetric and asymmetric functions for the two 
modes, are illustrated at the bottoms of Fig. 3a&3b. Fig. 4 further shows the 
temperature dependence of phonon frequencies. Both modes can be well described by 
anharmonic phonon process

where 0, kB and C are the phonon frequency extrapolated to 0 K, Boltzmann constant 
and fitting constant, respectively. The smooth temperature evolution suggests the 
absence of structure phase change over the measured temperature range, which is in 
agreement with the experimental facts of no CDW transition13. The  frequencies of 
the two modes extrapolated to 0 K (70.5 cm-1 and 118.94 cm-1 respectively) are 
almost the same in both crystals, which may imply a close composition in nominal 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 as mentioned above.

which indicates the interaction between discrete and continuous excitations. It is e-ph 
coupling in our case. Fano equation reads17,28

where I0 and  are scaling factor and full width at half maximum (FWHM), q is an 
inverse measure of asymmetry, which means that a larger q actually corresponds to a 
more symmetric peak. A peak will return to a pure Lorentzian shape at the limit of 
infinite q. The temperature dependence of extracted q is shown in Fig. 5. The value of 
q lies in the range of -4 to -6 and has a slight increase with decreasing temperatures. 
This means that a finite e-ph coupling always exists above SC transition temperatures.

(b). The red curves are anharmonic fittings using formula (2). 
 
The e-ph coupling constant  can be determined by phonon broadening e-ph 29. 
The broadening is obtained from the measured FWHM, the jump of phonon 
frequencies at SC transition29, 30, or the asymmetry factor q31. Actually it is quite 
complicated to derive e-ph from q. Measuring the frequency jump cross SC transition 
seems a relatively reliable way to estimate intrinsic phonon broadening. Unfortunately 
such jump is not available in our case. We will use e-ph extracted from the measured 
linewidths. Basically the total linewidth  is contributed by anharmonic phonon decay, 
temperature-independent impurity scattering and e-ph coupling. Accordingly, the 
linewidth can be described as31，

This allows to estimate an intrinsic broadening from e-ph coupling e-ph ~ 5.3 cm-1,

where N(Ef) is the bare density of state at Fermi energy and given by Nexp(Ef)/(1+)32, 
33. Eq. (4) gives  ~ 0.16 with ω0 = 118.9 cm-1. The derived e-ph coupling constant is 
supported by first-principles calculations, which give a close value for the same 
mode.8 The coupling strength leads to a Tc ~ 0 K using Allen-Dynes formula34, 35. 
Even the original linewidth ~9.3 cm-1 without subtracting impurity broadening,,  
only produces a  ~ 0.47 and Tc ~ 1.1 K. The value is still smaller than the 
experimental ones, which implies that the pairing glue for the new superconductors 
may not be the e-ph coupling. We note that in ref. 9 the authors employed a calculated 
DOS rather than an experimental one, which outputs an e-ph coupling constant of ~ 
0.68 and a Tc of ~ 5 K.  
 
III. Inter-band transitions 
Now we turn to the discussions on the low-frequency hump mentioned above. Fig. 
7 shows Raman response (imaginary part of Raman susceptibility) in cross 
polarization channel. A clear hump appears around 80 cm-1 at 10 K and smoothly 
shifts to 166 cm-1 at 300 K. Actually the hump can be also clearly seen in parallel

channel but superimposed by strong phonon modes (Fig. 1) . A phononic origin for 
the hump can be excluded because of its non-phononic-like shape, very large width 
and the unusual softening with decreasing temperatures. For the same reasons, the 
possibility that it comes from phonon signals of impurities, can be also ruled out. And 
structural characterizations demonstrate that the impurities, if existing, must have a 
negligible concentration in the crystals7. ARPES and optical measurements indicate 
that the plasma frequency in this system is ~2.1 eV, far beyond the observed 
characteristic energy ~ 0.15 eV13, 14. Magnetic excitations also seem unlikely to be the 


origin of the hump. Rare-earth Nd3+ are the only magnetic ions in the compounds. 
There is no observation of spin ordering of Nd3+ ions so far. Even if Nd3+ spins are 
ordered, generally it would occur at very low temperatures (~10 K). Thus, the above 
discussions lead to the possibility that the hump is contributed by electronic 
excitations at Fermi surface. 
Generally electronic Raman scattering (ERS) requires a finite momentum transfer, 
which is usually provided by phonons or impurities due to near-zero momentum of 
incident photons. But a special case is seen in the new BiS2-based superconductors. 
ARPES measurements reveal a finite band splitting caused by SOC at Fermi level and 
two separate rectangular-like Fermi surfaces around X points14, 15. The band splitting 
allows a vertical inter-band hopping around Fermi level without the assistance of 
phonons or impurities, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The same vertical hopping occurs not 
just at one k point, but along the longer side (-X) of rectangular Fermi surfaces. This 
dramatically boosts ERS signals, which actually contribute the observed 
low-frequency hump. A further quantitative analysis can be made based on the 
picture.  
For the vertical electron hopping between the two split bands, Raman response 
’’() is in general proportional to the hopping probability. Thus Raman response can 
be written as

. Taking the parameters into (5), we can make a good fitting for the hump, as shown at 
the bottom of Fig. 7a & 7b. The fitting allows us to define two characteristic energy 
scales, ω min and ω max, at which the hump takes half of its maximum. As depicted in 
Fig. 8, the energies correspond to two particular vertical hopping processes in which 
initial/final states are exactly located at Fermi level. They can be regarded as a good 
measure of band splitting. At 10 K, the fitting gives ω min ~ 24.79cm-1 (~3 meV) for 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 23.62cm-1 (~3 meV) for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2; ω max ~ 169.3cm-1 
(~21.0 meV) for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 158.2cm-1 (~19.6 meV) for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The 
values are in accord with the results given by ARPES14, 15, which demonstrates that 
the band splitting around X points lies in the range of 5 ~ 30 meV.  
 
Summary 
In summary, we have measured polarized Raman scattering spectra of BiS-based 
SC single crystal NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Tc = 4.5K) and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (Tc = 4.8K) from 
10K to 300K. The observed Raman modes are assigned with the aid of first-principles 
calculations. And an investigation on the Fano-type A1g mode gives an 
electron-phonon coupling constant  ~ 0.16, which is not strong enough to produce 
superconductivity at ~4.5 K. We further observe a low-energy electronic hump. It can 
be quantitatively explained by the vertical transitions around Fermi surface between 
the two bands split by spin-orbit coupling. The transitions are dramatically enhanced 
due to the particular rectangular-like Fermi surface, and hence provides a unique 
window to quantitatively probe the band splitting.

Supplementary information 
 
 
To exclude the impurity and surface effect, we have made various Raman measurements 
on different crystals which are repeatedly cleaved. The raw Raman spectra of four crystals are 
shown in Fig. S1. Each crystal is cleaved at least twice and Raman spectrum was recorded 
immediately after each cleavage. All the spectra show almost the same features and no 
substantial difference is seen among them. This indicates that impurity and/or surface effect is 
negligible in our case. The shoulder below 210 cm-1 comes from electron hopping between 
two split bands near Fermi surface (see Section III in context).
