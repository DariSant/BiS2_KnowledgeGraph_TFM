Abstract 
Application of high pressure (HP) induces evolution from metallic to semi-metallic state in 
the layered superconducting LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase, as concluded from ab initio calculations based 
on experimental P-dependent structural data. These changes in conduction properties are associated 
with a reported decrease in the superconducting transition temperature, Tc. However, further 
increase in pressure induces structural transformation in LaO1-xFxBiSe2 which results in a strong 
enhancement of its two-dimensionality with a related improvement in superconducting 
performance. In addition, the HP structural anisotropy induces a loss of long-range order 
correlations along the stacking direction of the LaO/F and BiSe2 layers yielding formation of 
stacking faults. Similar but even more pronounced structural transition was observed in the related 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 phase which is also accompanied by an increase in Tc. This demonstrates that 
enhancement of two-dimensionality in layered superconducting systems acts in favor of their 
superconducting performance. 
 
Introduction 
Layered 2D systems form a major class of superconductive materials with classics like Cu-
oxide and Fe-based compounds. Yet another family of layered BiCh2-based superconductors (Ch 
– chalcogenide S or/and Se atoms) have been discovered afterwards (Bi4O4S3 [1,2]) thus further 
enriching this vast constellation of 2D superconductive systems. The BiCh2-based materials have 
a typical for layered superconductors structure. Namely, they are composed of conducting BiCh2 
layers which are separated by blocking (spacer) layers which serve as charge reservoirs (Fig. 1, 
LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase is shown). This modular structural arrangement allowed synthesis of 
numerous derivatives of the parent Bi4O4S3 phase [3], similarly to Cu-oxide and Fe-based systems. 
Application of external pressure on the BiCh2-based compounds substantially alters their 
superconducting response. For instance, the LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 phase with a superconducting 
transition temperature of about 3 K [4,5] features a decrease of Tc as a function of pressure [5,6] 
(we denote this phase as SCI, P4/nmm symmetry). However, upon a further compression a new 
phase with an increased Tc ~ 6 K emerges (SCII phase) [5-7]. Emergence of the HP SCII phase 
was  observed  in  many  other  BiCh2-based  materials  [8-17],  including  LaO0.5F0.5BiS2  [17-20].

xFxBiSe2. Rotation arrows (right) schematically indicate decoupling between the BiSe2 bilayers and 
the reference LaO1-xFx framework resulting in P-induced stacking faults. 
 
The SCII phase was reported to crystallize in a monoclinic structure (P21/m), as concluded from 
P-dependent powder diffraction data [19]. The proposed HP model for the SCII phase does not, 
however, satisfactorily fit experimental data (Rwp = 25,5%) [19]. Interestingly, for certain BiCh2-
based phases superconducting response at ambient pressure can be enhanced in a similar way as 
for SCII phases by using a HP annealing technique [21-25] and this phenomena was reported to be 
related to the induced micro-structural changes along the c axis, in particular manifested through a 
peak broadening. Similar broadening was observed for the SCII phase [19]. Clearly, detailed P-
dependent structural studies on BiCh2-based materials are needed to reveal formation mechanism 
and nature of the SCII phase in order to better understand the associated improvement in 
superconducting performance. Here we report single crystal synchrotron radiation diffraction 
studies on LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 compounds as a function of external pressure and 
temperature. Related ab initio calculations have been performed to correlate experimental 
structural behavior and observed superconducting response at HP. 
 
Experimental details 
The LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 monocrystalline samples have been grown via high 
temperature flux method using high purity (at least 99.99%, Alfa) powders of La2O3, LaF3 and 
Se/S, and metallic La. For crystal growth 1g of raw materials, weighted in appropriate molar ratio 
[4] was blended with 5 g of flux composed of RbCl and NaCl (mixed in molar ratio: 0.56:0.44) and 
sealed in a double wall evacuated quartz ampoules. Ampoules were heated at 800°C over 15 h and 
then slowly (2 deg/hour) cooled down to 550°C, and then fast cooled to room temperature. Next 
the ampoules were opened in air and crystals were extracted by dissolving chloride flux in distilled 
water. Afterwards crystals were washed repeatedly with acetone and dried in air. The exact 
chemical compositions, as obtained from EDS analysis, are LaO0.76(1)F0.24(1)BiSe2 and 
LaO0.68(2)F0.32(2)BiS2 with corresponding Tc at ambient pressure of 2.6 and 3 K, respectively.  


P- and T-dependent synchrotron radiation diffraction data were collected at the ID27 High 
Pressure Beamline, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France. Initially, LaO1-
xFxBiSe2 was compressed at room temperature (RT) up to 55 GPa with a typical step of 2 GPa. For 
this the crystal was contained in a rhenium (Re) gasket with a hole of 125 µm (Dg) mounted on a 
diamond anvil cell (DAC) with 250 µm culets (Dc). The data were recorded on a flat panel Perkin 
Elmer detector. In order to study the SCI-SCII transition in greater details the LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 crystals have been compressed simultaneously up to 9 GPa with a typical step of 0.5 
GPa (Re, Dg = 300 µm, Dc = 600 µm, Mar165 CCD detector). Finally, compression of LaO1-
xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 crystals was performed simultaneously at 5 K up to 24 GPa in order to 
probe their superconducting regime (stainless steel gasket, Dg = 300 µm, Dc = 600 µm, Mar165 
CCD detector). For all measurements He gas was used as a pressure transmitting medium since it 
preserves excellent hydrostaticity up to at least 50 GPa [26]; ruby spheres were used as pressure 
gauges. No bridging, i.e. sample clamping between opposite diamonds, was observed for all the 
pressure ramps. Single crystal diffraction data were processed with a CrysalisPro suite [27] and 
refined with a SHELXL program [28]. 
 
Results and discussion 
Reciprocal spaces of the SCI phase for both LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 exhibit 
regular features fully compatible with a P4/nmm CeBiOS2-type structure (Fig. 2, left, Fig. 3, top). 
Neither reflections related to ferro-lattice-distortions observed for LaO1-xFxBiS2 [29] nor peak 
splitting indicative of a monoclinic symmetry reported for LaOBiS2 [30] are present in the SCI 
phase of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2. Reported symmetry variations could originate from a 
difference in the exact compositions of the studied samples. Indeed, it was shown that the energy 
difference between various polytypes of LaOBiS2 is rather small and, consequently, structural 
distortions can be tuned by chemical substitutions [31].   
The SCI-SCII transition in the LaO1-xFxBiSe2 sample occurred between 3.7 and 4.8 GPa 
(data for SCII taken at 5.9 GPa are shown on Fig. 2, right). The most striking difference between 
the SCI and SCII phases is a change in the nature of interactions along the c axis, direction of 
stacking of the BiSe2 and LaO1-xFx layers (Fig. 1). This is evident from the appearance of diffuse 
scattering propagating along the c* direction concomitant with a smearing of the corresponding 
Bragg reflections (Fig. 2, right bottom) which, for layered systems, is indicative of a presence of 
stacking faults [32,33]. Similar behavior was observed in LaO1-xFxBiS2 (Fig. 3, bottom). This 
indicates that the application of pressure induces anisotropic structural changes which results in a 
weakening of the interlayer interactions along the c axis.

P-induced transition (right, SCII phase). Reflections marked with green circles are not 
commensurate with the reciprocal lattice of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and originate from sample environment 
(diamonds, ruby spheres). Red circles (right) highlight a splitting of Bragg reflections resulting 
from twinning in the SCII phase induced by a tetragonal-orthorhombic symmetry lowering. Red 
arrows (right) indicate Bragg reflections of the HP SCII phase not present in the LP SCI phase; due 
to their relatively weak intensities contrast of the corresponding regions was enhanced for 
visualization purposes.

Indeed, structural response of LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2 to the application of HP is highly 
anisotropic, as concluded from single crystal diffraction data for LaO1-xFxBiSe2. Firstly, while the 
a and c structural parameters of SCI LaO1-xFxBiSe2 decrease upon application of pressure (Fig. 4, 
red and blue curves), a corresponding a/c ratio increases (Fig. 4, black curve). This indicates that 
relatively to a monotonic decrease along the c direction structure expands in the ab plane. 
Atomic parameters of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 also exhibit a strong anisotropy upon compression. 
The biggest change is observed for the Bi-Se2 distances which rapidly shrink as a function of 
pressure (Fig. 5, red lines). The relative decrease is equal to ~12% and results in a flattening of the 
BiSe5 pyramids (Fig.1, middle, the shown amplitude of the flattening is exaggerated for illustration 
purposes). Interestingly, the La-Se2 distances which correspond to the BiSe2-LaO/F interlayer 
interaction increase with pressure (Fig. 5, black lines), thus these bonds exhibit negative linear 
compressibility. The resulting weakening in the interlayer bonding yields a strong reduction in a 
long range crystalline order along the c axis with a subsequent phenomenon of stacking faults (Fig. 
1, right) with an associated appearance of diffuse scattering in the reciprocal space. The latter is in 
the origin of the peak broadening observed on P-dependent powder diffraction data for SCII phase 
[19]. The BiSe2 and LaO/F layers stay rather rigid in the ab plane and the corresponding bonding 
exhibits gradual compression with a much smaller relative changes of <3% for La-O/F (Fig. 5, 
green lines) and ~1% for Bi-Se1 distances (Fig. 5, blue lines). Results of structural refinement for 
all the datapoints presented on Figs. 4 and 5 are available in Supplemental Material [34].

Another interesting feature in the reciprocal space of SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 is a twinning-
induced splitting of Bragg reflections (Fig. 2, top right, marked with red circles). This twinning 
originates from the tetragonal-orthorhombic symmetry lowering associated with the SCI-SCII 
structural transformation and the two orthorhombic domains are rotated by ~1.8° with respect to 
each other.  The a and b parameters of orthorhombic SCII decrease rather monotonically and 
equally at low pressures but feature strong divergence above 30 GPa (Fig. 6, left). Indeed, the 
corresponding orthorhombic distortion, defined as δ = (a-b)/(a+b), is rather small below 30 GPa (δ 
~ 0.002) and reaches the value of 0.025 at the highest reached pressure of 55 GPa. This strong 
distortion indicates a change in the bonding interactions within the BiSe2 and LaO1-xFx layers at 
high pressure with a resulting large structural anisotropy in the ab planes. Full structural analysis 
for SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 based on single crystal diffraction data, similar to the one presented above 
for the SCI phase, was not possible since significant part of the diffraction signal was leaked to the 
diffuse scattering propagating along the c direction and, therefore, the SCII structure cannot be 
treated in a classical 3D approach. Spectroscopic probes like EXAFS could be useful to track 
bonding evolutions within the BiSe2 and LaO1-xFx layers for the SCII phase. We stress, however, 
that the SCII phase remains metrically orthorhombic (α = β = γ = 90˚) up to at least 55 GPa, i.e. no 
symmetry lowering is observed above 30 GPa and, therefore, the monoclinic P21/m symmetry with 
β = 97.3˚ suggested in [19] is not compatible with our data. The latter structure was proposed based 
on P-dependent powder diffraction data which is, by definition, not resolved in reciprocal space 
unlike data obtained with single crystal-based techniques. In powder-based data diffuse scattering 
is projected along with Bragg peaks on intensity vs. angle 2D plots and is manifested as peak 
broadening or intensity galos. Symmetry lowering proposed in [19] was able to partially account 
for these effects simply by generating larger number of reflections but, as expected, the final model 
could not be satisfying (Rwp = 25,5%) since this approach is experimentally limited. 


Even though the diffuse scattering along the c* direction emerges by the expense of 
intensities of the corresponding Bragg peaks it was still possible to track positions for many of the 
parent peaks of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 from the collected high resolution single crystal diffraction data. At 
the SCI-SCII transition point the c parameter, which corresponds to the direction of the stacking, 
features a decrease of 5.5% with a resulting reduction by 5% in the unit-cell volume (Fig. 6, right). 
These abrupt changes in structural parameters are characteristic of first-order structural transition. 
Experimental equations of states (EOS) for the SCI and SCII phases were obtained by fitting the 
corresponding V-P dependences with Murnaghan (Eq. 1) and 3rd order Birch-Murnaghan (Eq. 2) 
equations, correspondingly (Table 1). Here V0 - zero pressure volumes, B0 - bulk moduli and B0′ - 
their first pressure derivatives. The SCII is less compressible than the parent low pressure SCI 
phase and the corresponding zero pressure volume, V0, is diminished by ~4%.

Another difference between the SCII and SCI phases, in addition to the presence of stacking 
faults and the symmetry lowering, is the presence of new weak reflections with odd h+k indexes 
which violate the n glide plane of the parent P4/nmm symmetry (Fig. 2, top right, marked with red 
arrows). The actual space group cannot be assigned for the SCII structure due to a lack of long-
range correlations along the c stacking direction. The new hk0 pattern is, however, compatible with 
a model proposed in [29] featuring ferro-lattice-distortions.

volume (right) of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 up to P = 55 GPa. 
 
Although structure of the diffuse rods of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 is not regular (Fig. 2, bottom right), 
new intensity maximums with q = 0.5c* are clearly visible and some of those have even higher 
intensities than the parent q = 1c* reflections. This indicates that in addition to original (q = 1c*) 
correlations of the parent SCI phase new correlations, which correspond to the doubling of the c 
parameter of the SCI phase (q = 0.5c*), emerge. A corresponding stacking model could comprise 
alternative rotations/shifts of the BiS2 bilayers in opposite directions with respect to the reference 
LaO/F framework. Interestingly, the LaO1-xFxBiS2 phase features much more homogenous 
structure of the diffuse rods (Fig. 3, bottom) indicating that the corresponding correlations are 
mostly of a short range order. In addition, the SCI-SCII transition for the BiS2-based phase occurs 
between 1.0 and 1.7 GPa, which is lower than the corresponding transition pressure in LaO1-
xFxBiSe2. Therefore the interlayer BiS2 – LaO/F bonding is weaker compared to the corresponding 
interactions in the BiSe2-based phase. 
At ambient temperature the SCI-SCII transition is reversible, i.e. diffuse rods disappear 
upon decompression. Nevertheless, the HP annealing likely stabilizes the SCII phase which is 
manifested through a broadening of reflections on experimental powder diffraction data [21-25]. 
Single crystal diffraction experiments at HP-HT conditions are needed to confirm this likely 
scenario. Finally, compression at 5 K was performed to study phase behavior for both LaO1-
xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 at superconducting conditions. At 5 K the SCI-SCII transition in LaO1-
xFxBiSe2 occurred between 2.9 and 5.2 GPa, i.e. in the same pressure range as at ambient 
temperature. Similarly, the LaO1-xFxBiS2 sample transited already at 1.7 GPa (the first pressure 
point collected at 5 K). Thus the SCI-SCII phase boundary in a T-P space is rather vertical for both 
LaO1-xFxBiSe2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2 and the corresponding phase diagram is shown in Fig. 7.

class is indicated for the orthorhombic SCII phase. Conduction properties refer to the LaO1-
xFxBiSe2 phase and have been obtained from ab initio calculations based on experimental P-
dependent structural data for LaO1-xFxBiSe2 (Supplemental Material [34]). 
 
Electronic density of states (DOS) have been calculated for LaO1-xFxBiSe2 structures at 0 
and 3.7 GPa, right before the onset of the SCI-SCII transition, in order to deduce the origin of the 
decrease in Tc observed experimentally in this phase as a function of pressure [5,6]. Calculations 
were performed with a Wien2k 18.2 code [35] using the PBE-GGA exchange correlation potential 
[36]. The Brillouin zone (BZ) was divided with a k-mesh of 784 points (56 k-points in the 
irreducible region of the BZ). For each pressure structural parameters obtained from the 
corresponding diffraction data were used; O/F atomic position was considered as fully occupied 
solely by oxygen atoms (x = 0).

At ambient pressure the electronic states of LaO1-xFxBiSe2 (x = 0) at the Fermi level, EF, 
are populated essentially by p-levels of Se2 and O atoms (Fig. 8, left, red and blue curves) 
indicating a presence of an inter-layer charge transfer, similarly to the LaO1-xFxBiS2 system [37]. 
Electron doping by partial substitution of F for O directly replenishes electronic states at EF 
therefore enhancing metallic properties of the parent LaOBiSe2 phase. Contrary, application of HP 
nearly depletes electronic states at EF with a complete depletion right above EF producing a small 
bandgap of 0.04 eV (Fig. 8, right). The resulting semi-metallic behavior is associated with a 
decrease in Tc for this phase. However, the following SCI-SCII transition enhances two-
dimensionality in LaO1-xFxBiSe2, as demonstrated above, resulting in a phase with superior 
superconducting properties. 
 
Conclusions 
HP strongly enhances two-dimensionality in LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2. The associated reduction 
in long-range order along the direction of stacking of Bi(Se/S)2 and LaO/F layers induces formation 
of stacking faults. The HP SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase better preserves long-range order of the parent 
SCI phase compared to the S-containing one. This is evident from a more homogeneous structure 
of diffuse rods for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and, therefore, this system is characterized by weaker interlayer 
interactions which results in lower SCI-SCII transition pressure. Studied LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2 
systems illustrate how structural two-dimensionality is critical for layered superconductors. 
Targeted enhancement of 2D-structure of layered systems either by external (pressure, 
temperature) or internal (chemical doping, substitutions) means should be considered as another 
pathway to further improve their superconducting performance.
