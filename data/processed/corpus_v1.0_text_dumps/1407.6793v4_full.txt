Recently 
discovered 
BiS2-based 
layered 
superconductors have gained tremendous interest in the 
scientific 
community. 
These 
BiS2-based 
superconductors 
have 
superconducting 
transition 
temperature (Tc) as 4.5K for Bi4O4S3 [1,2], 2-5K for 
REO/FBiS2 (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) [3-6] and 2.8K for 
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 [7]. It is interesting to note that their 
parent phases LaOBiS2 [3] and SrFBiS2 [8] are 
semiconducting, which upon the O/F doping in former 
[3-6] and Sr/RE doping in later [7] become 
superconducting. 
Superconducting 
transition 
temperature in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 RE (La, Ce, Pr, Nd) is 
observed to increase under the hydrostatic pressure by 
three fold just in 2GPa pressure [9-14]. It is suggested 
that this dramatic increase in Tc is related to a structural 
phase 
transition 
under 
pressure 
especially 
for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 as reported by Tomita et.al [13]. 
Recently, we found that the Tc of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 
superconductor increased by fivefold from around 2K 
to above 10K, accompanied by the semiconducting to 
metallic normal state [15]. Keeping in view, that 
application of hydrostatic pressure has resulted in 
tremendous increase of Tc for the BiS2 based 
superconductors [9-15], one wonders how their non-
superconducting parent compounds will respond to the 
same.  In the present work, we measure the temperature 
dependent electrical resistivity from 300K down to 2K 
under applied hydrostatic pressure (0-2.5GPa) for 
SrFBiS2, which is the parent compound for the BiS2–
based superconductors [8]. 
In this study, the polycrystalline SrFBiS2 sample 
was synthesized by the standard solid state reaction 
route via vacuum encapsulation. Stoichiometric ratio of 
Sr, SrF2, Bi, and S were ground thoroughly in Ar-
controlled glove box before palletized. Rectangular 
pellets were vacuum sealed (10-3 Torr) in quartz 
ampoules and heat treated at 7800C for 12h at heating 
rate of 2oC/min with an intermediate grinding. X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature 
in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-80o in equal 
2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu 
Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed using 
the standard FullProf program. The obtained phase pure 
samples were used for pressure dependent resistivity 
measurements by Physical Property Measurements 
System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) where pressure 
applied by HPC-33 Piston type pressure cell with 
Quantum design DC resistivity Option. Hydrostatic 
pressures were generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped 
piston-cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a 
fluid (Daphne Oil) pressure transmitting medium in a 
Teflon cell. Annealed Pt wires were affixed to gold-
sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver 
epoxy in a standard four-wire configuration.  
 
 
Figure 1 (Color online). Room temperature Reitveld fitted 
XRD pattern of SrFBiS2 
The room temperature observed and Reitveld fitted 
XRD pattern of SrFBiS2 compound is shown in the 
figure 1. The SrFBiS2 crystallized in tetragonal 
structure with space group P4/nmm. The estimated 
parameters are a=4.08(3)Å and c=13.78(2)Å as 
obtained from minimizing difference between the 
observed and calculated patterns, which are in 
confirmation with earlier report [8]. Inset of the figure 1 
is the unit cell of the SrFBiS2 compound.  
 
 
Figure 2 (Color online) Temperature (T) dependences of 
resistivity (ρ) under hydrostatic pressure for SrFBiS2 and the 
inset is the extended part of the same from 2K-8K.  
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of 
electrical resistivity under the different hydrostatic 
pressure (0-2.5GPa) for SrFBiS2 down to 2K. A clear 
semiconducting behavior can be observed in the 
temperature range 300-2K as temperature coefficient

dρ/dT<0 is negative. With increasing applied pressure 
the electrical resistivity decreases significantly.  At the 
applied pressures of 2.17 and 2.5GPa the electrical 
resistivity becomes almost temperature independent. 
The inset of the figure 2 shows the zoomed portion of 
same in the temperature range 8K to 2K. There is no 
indication of superconducting transition down to 2K 
under maximum applied pressure of 2.5GPa. Though 
the suppression of resistivity in SrFBiS2 under 
hydrostatic pressure is similar to the as for other BiS2-
based layered superconductors viz., LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, but did not show superconductivity  
down to 2K under applied pressure of 2.5GPa. The 
absolute ρ value at 2K is two orders of magnitude less 
than as in ref. 7 and even four orders lower than as in 
ref.8. This may happen due to the volatility of Bi, S and 
F in these compounds [7,8], and is in fact debatable.     
   
 
Figure 3 (Color online) Pressure dependence of activation 
energy (Ea), being evaluated from thermal activation 
equation; the solid line is a guide to eye. Inset is the lnρ Vs 
1/T for the different pressures (0-2.5GPa) for SrFBiS2; the 
solid lines are the extrapolation to the fitted portion. 
Figure 3 presents the thermal activation energy (Ea) as a 
function of applied hydrostatic pressure as obtained 
from fitting of the resistivity data to the equation 
ρ(T)=ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT) above 100K. Except for 0.35GPa, 
the thermal activation energy drops exponentially with 
pressure. Inset of the figure 3 is the plot of ln(ρ) Vs 1/T 
to evaluate the activation energy of SrFBiS2 from 0-
2.5GPa pressure. It is interesting to note that the value 
of ρ0 under different hydrostatic pressures remains 
almost same close to 7.2mΩ-cm. This observation 
suggests that at highest temperature the resistivity of 
sample is almost constant even under different 
hydrostatic pressures. The activation energy decreases 
with increasing pressure and saturates close to 5.3meV. 
This suggests that the Fermi energy moves close to 
conduction band by increasing pressure, while the 
highest temperature resistivity remains constant. 
Detailed spectroscopic and theoretical investigations 
with and without pressure are warranted to validate this 
point on recently discovered SrFBiS2compound.  
In summary, the temperature dependence of 
resistivity suggests that the activation energy for one of 
the parent compound of BiS2-based superconductor 
SrFBiS2 decreases under applied pressure. Further, 
superconductivity could not be induced down to 2K 
under applied pressure of as high as 2.5GPa.
