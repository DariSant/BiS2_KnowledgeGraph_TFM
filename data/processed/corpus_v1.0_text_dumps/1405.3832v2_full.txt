Abstract 
We study normal state electrical, thermoelectrical and thermal transport in polycrystalline BiS2-
based compounds, which become superconducting by F doping on the O site. In particular we 
explore undoped LaOBiS2 and doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either with or without high 
pressure annealing, in order to evidence the roles of doping and preparation conditions. The high 
pressure annealed sample exhibits room temperature values of resistivity  around 5 mcm, 
Seebeck coefficient S around -20 V/K and thermal conductivity  around 1.5 W/Km, while the 
Hall resistance RH is negative at all temperatures and its value is -10-8 m3/C at low temperature. The 
sample prepared at ambient pressure exhibits RH positive in sign and five times larger in magnitude, 
and S negative in sign and slightly smaller in magnitude. These results reveal a complex multiband 
evolution brought about by high pressure annealing. In particular, the sign inversion and magnitude 
suppression of RH, indicating increased electron-type carrier density in the high pressure sample, 
may be closely related to previous findings about change in lattice parameters and enhancement of 
superconducting Tc by high pressure annealing. As for the undoped sample, it exhibits the 10 times 
larger resistivity, 10 times larger |S| and 10 times larger |RH| than its doped counterpart, consistent 
with its insulating nature. Our results point out the dramatic effect of preparation conditions in 
affecting charge carrier density as well as structural, band and electronic parameters in these 
systems. 
 
Introduction 
The crystal structure of layered superconductors, such as CuO2-based and Fe-based compounds, is 
described as consisting of a charge reservoir layer plus a high mobility layer, with the former 
providing charge doping and the latter hosting the Cooper pairs. This charge transfer scenario has 
offered a key to understand superconducting mechanisms in these materials and, even more 
importantly, it has driven the efforts of researchers towards the synthesis of new superconductors. 
Indeed, a new class of layered superconductors has been discovered very recently, namely BiS2-
based compounds such as Bi4O4S3 (Tc~4.5 K) 1,2, Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 3 and REO1–xFxBiS2 (RE=La, Ce, 
Pr, Nd) systems. Among the latter ones, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibits the largest onset Tc~11.1 K 4,5. The 


crystal structure of La(O,F)BiS2 is composed of a stacking of La2(O,F)2 layers and double BiS2 
layers. In terms of electronic bands, the parent compound LaOBiS2 is a band insulator with an 
energy gap of 0.4 eV between a valence band consisting of O and S p states and a conduction band 
consisting of Bi 6p and S 3p states 6. With the partial substitution of O by F, electrons are doped 
into the conduction band and eventually superconductivity appears, with maximum Tc of about 3 K 
for x=0.5, in correspondence of a topological change of the Fermi surface 7,6. More specifically, the 
Fermi surface is markedly two-dimensional and close to x=0.5 it fulfills good nesting conditions 6,7. 
From calculation of phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling constant for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
(λ=0.8) 8, it turns out that this material is a conventional phonon mediated superconductor, however 
it has been suggested that although the electron-phonon interaction plays the main role in the 
Cooper pairing, the good Fermi surface nesting may cooperate to give an enhanced attractive 
pairing interaction around the nesting vectors 7, in analogy with what is generally accepted to occur 
for iron-based superconductors. This gives rise to an s-wave pairing with a constant gap sign, which 
has been indeed observed experimentally by muon-spin spectroscopy 9. Nevertheless, the issues of 
pairing mechanism and pairing symmetry are still under debate. Indeed, scanning tunneling 
microscopy studies have found very large values of the reduced gap in BiS2 based superconductors 
10, more compatible with unconventional pairing symmetry than with conventional s-wave 
superconductivity. Moreover, neutron scattering studies have suggested that the electron-phonon 
coupling in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 could be weaker than expected 11. A more insightful investigation of the 
relationship between superconducting and normal state properties may add further clues about the 
phase diagram and thereby also about the conventional versus unconventional character of the 
relevant pairing mechanism. 
In this work, we specifically address the issue of how F doping and preparation conditions, in 
particular high pressure (2 GPa) annealing, affect normal state properties and superconducting Tc in 
LaO1–xFxBiS2 bulk samples. Indeed, it has been found that high pressure annealing yields a uniaxial 
lattice contraction along the c axis, as well as elongation of the a axis 12,4, which could be positively 
linked with the enhancement of superconducting Tc from 3 to 11 K 13,4. Also the effectiveness of 
charge doping may be more or less directly affected by the preparation conditions. Theoretical 
investigations have indicated F doping as the most effective to induce free charge carriers in BiS2 
planes, as compared to other possible chemical substitutions 14. A charge transfer of about 0.26e per 
unit formula to the BiS2 planes in x=0.5 F doped samples has been calculated 6. On the other hand, 
F doping has been predicted to affect the band gap 15, making the relationship between nominal and 
effective doping less straightforward. From the experimental point of view, it has been evidenced 
that Bi deficiency may severely decrease the actual charge doping with respect to the nominal one 
16.  
In the following, we present magnetotransport, thermoelectrical and thermal transport 
characterization of the normal state of LaO1–xFxBiS2 bulk samples, in order to gain insight into the 
electronic properties of this compound. In particular, we examine an undoped sample (x=0) as well 
as two optimally doped ones (x=0.5) prepared with or without high pressure annealing and compare 
their behaviors. 
 
Experimental 


Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are prepared by solid-state reaction using powders of 
La2S3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.9%), BiF3(99.9%), Bi2S3 and grains of Bi (99.99%). The Bi2S3 powder is 
prepared by reacting Bi (99.99%) and S (99.99%) grains at 500 ºC in an evacuated quartz tube. The 
starting materials with a nominal composition of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are mixed-well, pressed into 
pellets, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 700 ºC for 10h. As an additional step, the 
obtained polycrystalline samples are annealed at 600 ºC under a high pressure of 2 GPa for 1 hour, 
using a cubic-anvil high-pressure synthesis apparatus. 
Magnetotransport behavior is investigated by means of a Physical Properties Measurement System 
(PPMS) by Quantum Design at temperatures from room temperatures down to 2K and in magnetic 
fields up to 9T. Hall coefficients (RH) are determined measuring the transverse resistivity at selected 
fixed temperatures, sweeping the field from -9T to 9T. Seebeck (S) effect and thermal conductivity 
are measured with the PPMS Thermal Transport Option in continuous scanning mode with a 0.3 
K/min cooling rate. 
 
Results 
In figure 1, the resistivity  curves of the undoped and doped samples prepared either by 
conventional solid-state reaction at ambient pressure (LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP) or by high-pressure 
annealing (LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP) are presented. All the three samples exhibit semiconducting behavior 
in the whole temperature range of the normal state. The values of the room temperature resistivity 
are 28 mcm for the undoped sample and an order of magnitude smaller for the doped ones, 
namely 3.2 mcm for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP and 4.8 mcm for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP, all in fair 
agreement with previous reports 5,12,13,17. Despite the two doped samples LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP and 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP have similar resistivity values at low temperature, the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP sample 
curve has a steeper temperature dependence, suggesting larger activation energy for transport. The 
doped sample LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP become superconducting at temperature Tc-90%=2.36K (defined at 
90% of normal state resistivity) and the resistivity is not completely vanished at the minimum 
temperature of our measurement T=2K. In the case of the doped sample LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP we find 
a transition temperature Tc-90%=8.46K and a transition width of 1.24K. These data are again in 
agreement with previous works reporting on the effect of high pressure annealing in improving 
superconducting properties 4,13.

The normal state longitudinal magnetoresistivity ((H)-(H=0))/(H=0), not shown, is negligibly 
small (<1%) at all temperatures for all the samples. 
 
In figure 2, Hall effect curves of the three samples are plotted. In the case of the doped 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP sample, RH is negative at all temperatures and slightly increasing in magnitude 
with decreasing temperature, with a value around -10-8 m3/C at low temperature just above the 
superconducting transition. This behavior is indeed reminiscent of that of Fe-based superconductors 


of different families, e.g. F doped 1111 compounds 18,19, electron doped 122 compounds 20,21 and 
other families of Fe-based superconductors 22. For the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP sample the magnitude of 
RH is on average 5 times as much, consistent with other literature data 23, indicating lower electron 
density. However, quite remarkably, it is positive in sign. Positive RH
  has also been found in other 
BiS2 superconductors at optimal electron doping 24. Finally, RH of the LaOBiS2 sample is negative, 
weakly dependent of temperature and its magnitude is around few times 10-7 m3/C, i.e. 10 times 
larger than that of the corresponding doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP sample. 
It must be said that whereas for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP sample Hall effect measurements are carried 
out easily, in the case of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP and LaOBiS2 samples the experimental data points 
are more scattered, not due to the magnitude of the Hall signal itself, but possibly due to charging at 
grain boundaries. Also bismuth and bismuth oxide impurities may be responsible of erratic Hall 
effect measurements, but in our case bismuth phase is not detected by X-rays diffraction analysis 
and moreover the negligible magnetoresistance is not consistent with magnetotransport behavior of 
bismuth and bismuth oxides.

In figure 3, we present Seebeck coefficient S curves of the three samples. It can be seen that in all 
cases, the Seebeck coefficients are roughly linear with temperature, suggesting that the diffusive 
mechanism of charge carriers dominates. This result is in agreement with similar optimally doped 
compounds such as PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 25, but at odds with other BiS2-based superconductors, where 
non-monotonic behavior with a pronounced minimum possibly related to a drag mechanism is 
observed 26. Contrarily to Hall resistance curves, the Seebeck coefficient curves are negative at all 
temperatures for all the three samples. In particular, the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP exhibits negative S and 
positive RH, similarly to the case of other electron-doped BiS2 superconductors 24. No appreciable 
dependence on magnetic field is detected in the normal state Seebeck curves (in-field curves are not 
shown in figure 3), as expected in the diffusive regime. Only below Tc of the doped samples the 
Seebeck curves at 0H=7T and 0T deviate, as a consequence of the finite upper critical field.

In figure 4, thermal conductivity  curves of the three samples are displayed. For the undoped

samples exhibit monotonic thermal conductivity and smaller thermal conductivity values. The 
doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP sample has smaller thermal conductivity than the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-LP 
sample. No dependence of  on magnetic field is observed (in-field curves are not shown in figure

Data analysis and discussion 
Combining resistivity, Hall coefficient and Seebeck coefficient data we can carry out a fit of normal 
state properties, with carrier densities n, mobilities  and effective masses meff as parameters. In a 
single band picture we use for resistivity and Hall coefficient the relationships =(en)-1 and 
RH=(en)-1, while for the Seebeck coefficient we use the Mott relationship valid for isotropic 
degenerate materials in the diffusive regime:

of fitting parameters n and meff, a free electron picture with parabolic dispersion and spherical Fermi 
surface is assumed. In case of two band picture, with electrons (subscript e) and holes (subscript h) 
contributing to transport, the appropriate relationships would be =((enee)-1+(enhh)-1)-1,

, where the Seebeck coefficients of each band are calculated 
according to the Mott relationship eq. (1). 
Clearly in a single band approximation these parameters are univocally determined, whereas if we 
assume both electrons and holes contributions the solution are not anymore univocal. In figure 5 we 
show the mobility and carrier concentration resulting from the single band fitting of the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-HP sample. The electron mobility is on average 0.5-2cm2/(Vs), slightly decreasing 
with increasing temperature. The electron density is in the range 5·1020-7·1021 cm-3, slightly 
increasing with increasing temperature. Noteworthy, 2.3·1021 cm-3 is just what expected from the 
nominal x=0.5 F doping. Moreover, in ref. 6 it is predicted that 0.7+0.26=0.96 electrons per unit cell 
are doped in the BiS2 layers of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, corresponding to 4.4·1021 cm-3 in fair agreement 
with our data. However these charge carriers seem not to be very mobile, as seen from low mobility 
values and from semiconducting behavior of resistivity, possibly as a consequence of strong 
interaction with boson fluctuations, or else as a consequence of many-body interactions 7, or else in 
relation with the predicted quasi-nested Fermi surface leading to the charge density wave instability 
27. From the fitting, values of the electron effective mass around m0 (m0 bare electron mass) are 
obtained, in agreement with ref. 26.

Figure 5: (color online) electron charge density and mobility obtained from single band fitting of  and RH data of 
doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample, prepared with high pressure annealing. 
 
If we assume a two band description with hole and electron contributions, all the physically realistic 
solutions for the set of parameters present some common features: (i) electron mobilities are larger 
than hole mobilities at all temperatures; (ii) at low temperature electron densities are around 1021 
cm-3 or larger and holes densities are one order of magnitude smaller than electron density, while at 
high temperature hole and electron densities are similar; (iii) effective masses are of the order of m0. 
This picture indicates that below 100K the system can be approximately described in a single band 
picture, taking into account only the electron contribution to transport. 
For the doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample, it is not possible to assume a single band description, 
because it could not account for the different sign of RH and S. On the contrary, in a two band 
description this situation may occur, because, roughly speaking, bands contributions are weighed by 
n2 in the expression for RH, while they are weighed by  in the expression for S. Hence, if we 
allow for a band of electrons with smaller density and higher mobility, it may determine the 
negative sign for S even with a positive RH. All the different solutions compatible with our 
experimental data present common robust characteristics, namely: (i) both electron and hole 
mobilities increase with increasing temperature; e varies from few cm2/(Vs) at low temperature to 
several tens cm2/(Vs) at 300K, while h is one order of magnitude smaller; (ii) both electron and 


hole densities are weakly temperature dependent except for the lowest temperature; ne is 1-5·1018 
cm-3, while nh is 1019-1020 cm-3; (iii) both effective masses are around 0.5-1 m0. In short, according 
to this picture there are more holes than electrons, but holes have much lower mobility. It may 
appear strange that the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample has lower |S| and at the same time lower carrier 
concentrations as compared to the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample. Indeed, this is a multiband effect, 
explained by the more balanced competition between electron and hole type carriers in the former 
sample. 
Finally single band fittings for the undoped LaOBiS2 sample yield average electron density few 
times 1019 cm-3, a factor 10 smaller than that of the corresponding doped sample LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP, 
mobilities values that increase with temperature from 0.2 to 15 cm2V-1s-1 and effective masses 
around 0.5m0. Obviously a two band scenario is possible as well. 
In summary, the simple inspection of rough experimental data of resistivity, Seebeck coefficient 
and RH in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP samples, reveal that these two samples are 
significantly different. Indeed, RH of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample is positive and nearly 5 times 
larger in magnitude than RH of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample, which is negative. S of the two 
samples are both negative, but  the S magnitude in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample is slightly smaller 
than S of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample. Finally, resistivities are comparable in magnitude, but the 
curve of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample has steeper temperature dependence, indicating larger 
activation energy in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample. As a further step, the data analysis, despite its 
simplifying assumptions, confirms that the preparation conditions have a strong effect on normal 
state properties. The average values of the parameters obtained from the fittings in the three samples 
are summarized in Table I, for easy comparison. The major difference between LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP 
and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP samples is the enhanced electron density in the latter, which is likely closely 
related to the enhancement of superconducting Tc from 3 to 11 K 4,13. Moreover, these data suggest 
that the preparation conditions yield not only different charge carrier densities, but also different 
band and electronic parameters, such as larger effective mass and lower mobility in the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample as compared to the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_LP sample. Both the larger effective 
mass and the lower mobility may be possibly related to stronger coupling with boson excitations, 
indeed enhanced coupling strength at optimal doping has been suggested for BiS2 based 
superconductors in ref. 24. We note that also the analysis of superconducting properties has 
indicated different band and electronic parameters in samples prepared either with or without high 
pressure annealing 28.

We now consider the thermal conductivities of the three samples. For the undoped sample, the 
thermal conductivity increases with temperature at low temperature, due to increasing excitation of 


phonons. In this regime the dominant phonon scattering mechanism is by defects and grain 
boundaries. At high temperature, the thermal conductivity decreases with temperature, due to 
enhanced phonon-phonon scattering, which is the dominant scattering mechanism in this regime. At 
intermediate temperature there is a broad maximum, as a consequence of the crossover between the 
above mentioned regimes. It is expected that with increasing disorder or grain boundary density, the 
regime of defect scattering extends up to larger temperatures, and eventually the broad maximum is 
damped, yielding a monotonic shape of the (T) curve. This is indeed the case of the F doped 
samples, which show monotonic behavior typical of more disordered materials (or materials with 
higher density of grain boundaries) as compared to the undoped sample, which seems to have a 
more ordered crystal lattice (or larger grains). 
It may appear unexpected that the doped sample prepared at high pressure has smaller thermal 
conductivity than the one prepared at low pressure, given that the former should have higher density 
and better intergrain connection. On the other hand, this finding is consistent X-rays analysis 4, 
which exhibits more broadened X-rays peaks after high pressure annealing. The broader peaks in 
high pressure annealed samples indicate the presence of disorder and inhomogeneity, which may be 
due to a competition of tetragonal and monoclinic phases in high pressure samples 29. Structural 
inhomogeneity in similar samples has been also detected from the analysis of magnetotransport data 
in the superconducting state, where the upper critical field parallel to BiS planes has been found to 
be anisotropic, indicating that these crystalline planes are distorted into a lower-symmetry as 
compared to the tetragonal structure 28. It can be noted that also electronic mobility, which is 
smaller in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2_HP sample (see Table I), may be affected by such disorder and 
inhomogeneity. 
Using the Wiedemann-Franz law we estimate that the thermal conductivity is dominated by phonon 
thermal transport for all the samples, as indicated by the dashed lines in figure 4. This finding is 
consistent with the low charge carrier mobility (in all samples  is larger than 1.5 W/Km at room 
temperature, while the corresponding electron contribution is estimated smaller than 0.2 W/Km). 
The absence of magnetic field dependence of  is consistent with  being dominated by the lattice 
contribution. 
 
Conclusions 
We study normal state electrical, thermoelectrical and thermal transport in polycrystalline undoped 
LaOBiS2 and doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either by conventional solid-state reaction at 
ambient pressure or by additional high pressure annealing. 
All our samples present common behaviors such as semiconducting resisitivity, diffusive and 
negative Seebeck effect and thermal transport dominated by phonon contribution. However, the 
major difference between doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either by conventional solid-state 
reaction at ambient pressure or by high pressure annealing, lies in the sign and magnitude of the 
Hall resistance, which is positive in sign and larger in magnitude in the former sample and negative 
in sign and smaller in magnitude in the latter sample. This finding indicates the role played by the 
multiband character of these compounds. The higher electron concentration of samples prepared by 
high pressure annealing may be closely related to the enhanced superconducting Tc11 K and to the 
change of structural parameters. Our results indicate that not only charge carrier densities, but also 
band and electronic parameters are affected by preparation conditions. This work should trigger ab 
initio calculations which could provide a theoretical framework for our experimental outcomes.
