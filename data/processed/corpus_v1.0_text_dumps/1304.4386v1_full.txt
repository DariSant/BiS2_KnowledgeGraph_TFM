Abstract 
 
We report on the synthesis and extensive characterization of layered Bi4O4S3 superconductor. This is 
the optimally doped sample with Tc ~5.3 K out of a series of Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x samples synthesized 
by solid state reaction.  The series was synthesized towards establishing a phase diagram of transition 
temperature as a function of carrier concentration. Crystal structure for Bi4O4S3 shows larger bending 
of Bi2-S2-Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer compared to that for the parent phase. Scanning electron 
microscopy images show platelets like morphology for Bi4O4S3 signifying the layered structure.  
While the parent compound is found to be semiconducting, the electrical resistivity of Bi4O4S3 
exhibits T2 dependence in a small temperature range between 25 and 50 K. The typical dome structure 
for variation of Tc with dopant concentration is not observed. From the magneto-transport data Hc2 for 
Bi4O4S3 is estimated to be ~2.75T with WHH approximation and the corresponding coherence length 
is ~110Å. Support for multiband signatures is not seen from magneto-resistance data.  RF 
susceptibility data fits well for S-wave isotropic gap with gap value higher than BCS strong coupling 
limit. Hall measurements confirm dominance of electronic transport with charge carrier density of 
4.405×1019 cm−3 at 10 K. The experimental value of Seebeck coefficient at 35K is well in accord with 
the calculated value deduced by using density of charge carriers from Hall experiments.  The 
Sommerfeld constant γ is estimated to be ~ 1.113 mJ/K2 mol.  Evidence for thermally activated flux flow is 
observed and the pinning potential is found to scale as   B-0.3 for B < 0.1T and B-1.99 for B > 0.1T.

Introduction 
The recent discovery of superconductivity in bismuth oxy-sulphide Bi4O4S3 has underlined 
the serendipitous possibilities in layered chalcogenides.1-6 Pure bismuth itself has five 
different phases that are superconducting below 8.5 K, therefore the initial challenges 
focussed on ruling out impurity phases and establish bulk superconductivity with Tc ~ 4.4 K.2  
It was quickly deciphered that induction of superconductivity in this compound of tetragonal 
crystal structure is achieved through SO4 deficiency in the parent Bi6O8S5.1,2 It is now 
established that like CuO2 and FeAs layers of high Tc cuprates and pnictides, 
superconductivity in this oxy-sulphide is confined to BiS2 layers.  Subsequently, following 
ideas from oxypnictides,  LaOBiS2 is traced to be superconducting when doped with F at the 
place of O.7-15  Superconductivity is also confirmed when La is replaced by the rare earth 
elements Nd, Ce, Pr and Yb with corresponding Tc = 5.616(5.2K),17 3.0,18 5.5 K19 and 5.4 K9 
respectively.  It is suggested that in YbO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductivity coexists with 
magnetism below ~2.7 K.9  It may be noted that Sm/Gd based BiS2 (that shows high Tc in 
oxypnictides) has not yet been reported even though smaller rare-earth ion Yb based 
compound is superconducting.  It was also suggested that SrFBiS2 might also be a potential 
family for BiS2 superconductors.20   This is experimentally verified with recent report of 
superconductivity in Sr1-xLaxFBiS2.21 Further, Ag and Cu have also been doped at the place of 
Bi but in both the cases suppressed superconductivity is reported.22,23  
Theoretical studies have surmised that the dominating bands for the electron 
conduction in Bi4O4S3 are derived from the Bi 6px and 6py orbitals.1 Strong nesting of the 
Fermi surface and quasi-one-dimensional bands are also predicted.24,25 Structurally, Bi4O4S3 
is composed of a set of BiS2 layers sandwiched between adjacent Bi4O4(SO4) spacer layers.1 
A schematic view of the crystal structure is shown in Figure 1. The Bi atoms are coordinated 
by four S atoms in the BiS2 plane which form a square-net perpendicular to c-axis. Similar 


structure is also ascertained for parent phase Bi6O8S5. It is inferred, on the basis of band 
calculations, that Bi6O8S5 is an insulator.1,24 Superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 is induced by 
electron doping into the BiS2 layers via the defects of the SO4 ions at the interlayer site1 and 
in particular Bi4O4S3 possess 50% defects at a SO4 site. A recent study on Hall and magneto-
resistance measurements predicts an exotic multi-band features for Bi4O4S3.3 Further, on the 
basis of electron-phonon coupling constant calculated for LaO1−xFxBiS2 (λ = 0.85), there are 
indications of a strongly coupled electron-phonon superconductor.9,10 There are reports on 
possibility of spin fluctuations leading to unconventional pairing mechanism as evidenced in 
cuprates, and pnictides.8 Some theories predict structural instabilities15,26 which places this 
system in close proximity to competing ferroelectric and charge density wave (CDW) 
phases.15 This instability is possibly caused by anharmonic potential of the S ions lying on the 
same plane as the Bi ions. Just like the spin-density wave (SDW) instability in Fe-based 
superconductors, a CDW instability from negative phonon modes at or around the M point, 
(π, π), is suggested to be essential to the superconductivity.15 As far as pairing symmetry is 
concerned, three possibilities, d-wave, extended s-wave, and p-wave have been studied based 
on two orbital RPA calculations.27  
In a sense, the whole story of BiS2 based layered superconductors is evolving in the 
side lines of the path taken by oxypnictides. But there are several points where strong 
departure from pnictides can be observed in disulphides. The broad questions about the multi-
band behaviour, BCS coupling parameters and pairing symmetry in (Bi4O4S3) the parent 
superconducting compound have remained unresolved. In this article we report, the evolution 
of superconducting properties in Bi4O4S3 with doping and address these issues along with 
extensive electromagnetic and thermodynamic characterizations.  Towards synthesizing 
Bi4O4S3, we have gradually created deficiency of SO4 in the SO4 layer of the parent 
compound Bi6O8S5 (Bi6O4S4(SO4).  Although a perfect dome has not been observed, we have 


successfully synthesized Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x superconductors. We could achieve the highest Tc 
phase achieved thus far (for x = 0.5) with Tc = 5.3 K. The main focus of the present study is 
the detailed characterization of Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x with nominal composition of x =0 and 0.5.  
The thermodynamic and transport properties of this material are then studied in detail using 
an array of experimental techniques such as the Hall Effect, rf susceptibility, electrical 
resistivity, magento-transport and Thermoelectric power. 
 
Experimental 
A series of polycrystalline samples of Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x  (x=0, 0.2, 0.25, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 
0.66, 0.75, 0.8) were prepared using the conventional solid state reaction method. For 
synthesis, Bi2S3, Bi2O3 powders and S grains were ground, pelletized, sealed into an 
evacuated quartz tube and heated at 510ºC for 12 h. The product was well-ground, pelletized 
and again annealed at 510ºC for 12 h in an evacuated quartz tube. Then it was cooled down 
slowly to room temperature. The second step was repeated for achieving good homogeneity. 
The resultant sample looked black and hard.  The samples were cut to rectangular shape 
(length 3 mm, width 2.5 mm and thickness of 0.5 mm).  Since it was hard, we polished the 
sample with very fine sand paper and obtained shiny and mirror like surface. The crystallinity 
of the sample was checked by using the x-ray diffraction (XRD) in a PANanalytical 
diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The analysis of XRD data were done with the Fullprof 
software. Resistivity and Hall measurements were carried out in low temperature and high 
magnetic field (8T) Cryogen Free system in conjunction with variable temperature insert. The 
thermoelectric power (TEP) was measured from 300K to 12K using an automated setup that 
was attached to a Closed Cycle Refrigerator.  A rectangular sample was mounted between 
two copper blocks and two small chip heaters (50Ω) were used to produce heat gradient. The 


rf susceptibility was performed by tunnel diode oscillator technique. The sample was kept 
inside an inductor that formed a part of an LC circuit of an ultrastable oscillator (f~2.3 MHz).  
 
Results and Discussion  
Figure 2 shows the Rietveld refined XRD patterns for Bi4O4S3.  The calculated values 
for lattice parameters, bond lengths and bond angles for the parent Bi6O8S5 and 
superconducting Bi4O4S3 samples are given in Table 1. Rietveld refinement of the XRD 
pattern was carried out using the reported1,2  Wyckoff positions and space group I4/mmm. 
Some impurities of Bi (JCPDS No. 05-0519) and Bi2S3 (JCPDS No. 17-0320, ref. 28) are 
present which have also been taken into account for refinement that improved the fitting.  The 
quality of the refinement is indicated by the value of χ2 = 1.75 and 1.68 for the parent and 
superconducting phase respectively. The refined lattice constants of Bi4O4S3 are a = 3.967(5) 
Ǻ and c = 41.323(1) Ǻ which are slightly less than the values reported earlier2 and for 
Bi6O8S5 the values are a = 3.965(5) Ǻ and c = 41.234(0) Ǻ. The c axis increased for the 
superconducting phase indicating relaxation in the structure after losing 50% of SO4 ion from 
SO4 layer. This is in consonance with decreased Tc with increasing external pressure.4  The 
crystal structure made by refined Wyckoff positions indicates that the S and Bi atoms do not 
stay in a single plane in the BiS2 layer (Figure 1) for the superconducting Bi4O4S3 phase. For 
Bi4O4S3, the out of plane angle between S2-Bi2-S2 is found to be 162° and the in-plane S2-
Bi2-S2 angle is 88.6° for the adjacent BiS2 layers (Figure 1). This indicates slight 
deformation from the ideal square lattice of Bi2-S2 atoms. On the other hand, in the parent 
Bi6O8S5 sample, the out of plane S2-Bi2-S2 angle is ~171° and in plane S2-Bi2-S2 angle is 
89.7°. This suggests larger bending of Bi2-S2-Bi2 bond in case of superconducting sample.  
To investigate the surface morphology of the as grown samples, in Figure 3 we show 
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the parent and superconducting samples. The 


formation of platelet like morphology for Bi4O4S3 is well evident in Figure 3b which is an 
indication of layered structure.  The size of these crystals is in micrometer range having the 
average length and breadth ~ 6 µm and ~1 µm respectively. Comparing Figure 3a with Figure 
3b, we find the parent Bi6O8S5 has rather small sized crystals compared to Bi4O4S3.  This 
suggests better crystal growth characteristics for the superconducting sample.  
Figure 4a show the temperature dependence of resistivity from 1.6 K to 300 K for 
parent Bi6O8S5 (inset i) and 50% SO4 deficient superconducting Bi4O4S3.  The undoped 
sample shows semiconducting behaviour up to the lowest measured temperature. The value 
for room temperature resistivity is ~1 Ohm-cm that reaches to ~36 Ohm-cm at the lowest 
measured temperature. On the other hand, the electrical resistivity of Bi4O4S3 shows metallic 
behaviour in the normal state.  The inset (ii) of Figure 4a shows the resistivity behaviour near 
the superconducting transition. The onset of transition in this sample is Tc
onset = 5.3K as 
determined by the intersection of extrapolated normal state resistivity line with 
superconducting transition line. Similarly Tc offset is determined from the intersection at the 
zero resistance line and is estimated to be Tc0 ~4.8 K (inset ii, Fig 4a). These values are ~20% 
higher than earlier reports for this material.1-6 This could be explained by the fact that with 
variation in doping concentration we could achieve the optimal doping phase. We further 
note that the value of resistivity changes from 1.59 mOhm-cm at 300K to 0.786 mOhm-cm 
just above the transition temperature. Hence, the residual resistivity ratio (RRR) in this case is 
2.023.  The transport in this polycrystalline sample would have contribution from disorder 
and perhaps small amounts of impurities. The transition widths for Bi4O4S3 ∆Tc = Tc(onset) − 
Tc(offset) = 0.44 K is indicative of excellent grain connectivity. To gain further insight into 
the normal state electronic correlations, we fit the low-temperature resistivity data to a power 
law, ρ = ρ0 + ATα,and find that above 50 K, the resistivity data can be reasonably fit by with α 
= 0.78 where the values of ρ0 and A are estimated to be 0.695 mΩ-cm and 0.01 mΩ-cm/Kα 


respectively (Figure 4a). The data between 25 K and 50 K can be scaled with α = 2 (Figure 
4b), with the residual resistivity ρ0 is 0.847 mΩ-cm, and the coefficient A = 3.12×10-5 mΩ-
cm/K2. The value of ρ0 is large due to the polycrystalline nature of the sample.  Below 25K, 
the resistivity starts deviating from this Fermi liquid fitting.  It is to be noted that the value of 
A is close to the value reported for LaOFeAs.29  But a clear departure from Fermi liquid 
behavior near Tc  is indicated.  In order to get the transition temperature with varying 
concentration of charge carriers the Tc of SO4 deficient Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x samples were also 
measured.  The results have been summarized in inset iii of Fig 4a. It can be seen that 
superconductivity is not observed upto 25% of SO4 deficiency and decrease in Tc is seen 
beyond x = 0.5.  But superconductivity persists upto the maximum doping that we could 
achieve (x = 0.8).  This doping dependence of Tc
onset shows that x = 0.5 is the optimal doping 
concentration for which transition temperature is highest in Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x series.  However, 
we note that no clear dome structure is obtained putting question marks on the possibility of 
induction of superconductivity onto a strongly correlated insulator.  
The accompanying diamagnetic transition is confirmed by measurement of rf 
susceptibility (rf penetration depth). The data are shown in the inset (ii) of Figure 4b. The 
measured quantity is the shift in the resonant frequency, ∆f ≡ f(T) − f0 = −4πχ(T)G, where χ 
is the total magnetic susceptibility and G ≃ f0Vs/2Vc (1 − N) is a geometric calibration factor 
defined by the coil (Vc), and the sample (Vs)  volumes and the demagnetization factor N.30 
We note that magnetic transition of 5.1 K is lower by 0.2 K compared to onset resistivity 
decrease.  As reported elsewhere, detailed analysis of the penetration depth data are 
consistent with a S-wave gap of ∆0/kBTc ~ 2.4.31 This decidedly puts the nature of the 
superconductivity into strong coupling regime.  
Figure 5a shows the resistive transition for Bi4O4S3 as a function of magnetic field. 
The Tc(H) values for ρ onset and offset as a function of magnetic field and temperature are 


shown in inset of Figure 5b, which are equivalently  the upper critical Hc2(T) and 
irreversibility (Hirr (T)) fields respectively. The slope is estimated to be [dHc2/dT]|T=Tc = 
−0.75 T/K for ρonset  and −0.45 T/K for ρoffset for H≥ 0.05T.  In the conventional Ginzburg – 
Landau picture, Hc2 is linear in T near Tc0 and saturates in the 0K limit.  However, in the 
presence of impurity scattering32 or in a multiband scenario it shows deviations from the 
expected behaviour.  Nonetheless for the present case, we apply the Werthamer–Helfand–
Hohenberg (WHH) equation which relates the slope for ρonset to Hc2(0) = −0.693Tc[dHc2/dT] 
|T=Tc = 2.754 T. The extrapolated lines in Figure 5b are drawn by using the Ginzburg–Landau 
equation Hc2(T) = Hc2(0) (1 − t2)/(1 + t2) where t = T/Tc is the reduced temperature and Hc2(0) 
is the upper critical field at zero temperature which give the value slightly higher than that by 
WHH approach.  Assuming Hc2(0) = Hc2(WHH0), the Ginzburg–Landau coherence length 
ξGL= (Ф0/2πHc2)1/2, where Ф0=2.07×10−7 G cm2 yields zero temperature coherence length 
ξGL(0) ~ 110Å.  Further, as seen in, inset of Figure 5a, we note that although bulk 
superconductivity can be suppressed above 3T, a kink in resistivity is present on the ρ versus 
T curve.   Even with the maximum applied magnetic field of 4T this feature stays at about 
5K. In an earlier study, this behaviour has been interpreted as the residual Cooper pairs 
existing in the system even when the bulk superconductivity has been completely suppressed 
which supports the applicability of strong coupling theories.3 
In Figure 6 we show the Hall resistivity ρxy with varying field at 10K and 300K. The 
Hall resistivity is negative for all fields and show nonlinearity at both the temperatures which 
suggests possible deviations from single-band analysis.2,3,18 Clearly, the conduction 
mechanism is dominated by electronic transport.  The Hall coefficient is field-dependent and 
the carrier concentration estimated from low field value is n~ 4.405×1019 cm−3 at 10 K and 
that increases to ∼7.28×1019 cm−3 at 300 K.  These values are almost three times higher than 
the values reported by Singh et al (~1.53×1019 cm−3 at 10K) while close to the values given 


by Li et al (~4.5×1019 cm−3 at 2K).2,3
  Moreover, the magnetoresistance for a multiband 
system is expected to follow ∆ρxx/ρ0 α H2 behavior in the low field region and as plotted, in 
the inset of Figure 6, no such dependence is seen.  Clearly more studies are needed to 
establish the applicability of exotic multi band theories.3 
The Seebeck coefficient (S) of Bi4O4S3 with respect to copper is shown in Figure 7. In 
agreement with Hall data, S is negative in the whole temperature range varying from ~ −23 
µV/K at 300 K to a maximum negative value of ~ −30.5 µV/K at ~35 K.  In general, the S(T) 
would consist of three parts; the diffusion term, the spin-dependent scattering term and the 
phonon-drag term due to electron-phonon interaction.33 The spin-dependent contribution in 
particular, would be weak since there are no magnetic elements in Bi4O4S3. The phonon-drag 
effect usually gives a peak structure in the temperature dependence of thermopower (TEP). 
At high temperature, the phonon-drag part of the TEP varies as 1/T, and at low temperature it 
goes as ~T3 and consequently there is a peak in S(T) at ~ θD /5 (where θD is the Debye  
temperature ) in transiting from the high-temperature to the low-temperature regime. Heat 
capacity measurement done by Takatsu et al. estimates θD ~192 K for Bi4O4S3.
5 The 
pronounced peak in our S(T) data around 35K is very close to the value ∼ θD/5 = 38 K that 
confirms the contribution due to the phonon-drag effect. This peak structure was not observed 
in the in previous reports of TEP in Bi4O4S3.6, 22  Further, the carrier concentration from low-
temperature Hall data can be used to obtain a qualitative estimate of diffusive part of Seebeck 
coefficient and so the effective mass of charge carriers m* and the Sommerfeld coefficient γ 
can be estimated.  If we assume that the electron carrier concentration below ~35 K is close 
to the value inferred from the Hall data (4.405×1019 electrons/cm3
 at 10K), the free electron 
model predicts a Fermi energy (temperature) of 45.53 meV (528.29 K).34 In low carrier 
concentration metals,33 the Seebeck coefficient is given by the diffusion contribution of the 
Mott expression or S = π2kBT(2eTF)−1, where TF is the Fermi temperature. If we use a value 


for of 528.29 K for TF in the expression for S, this results in a Seebeck value of −28.9 µV/K 
at 35K, which yields excellent matching with the measured value of −30.5 µV/K at the same 
temperature (relative to the value of copper SCu ~ 1.8 µV/K). That signifies that the effective 
mass of electron equals to its rest mass around 35 K.  This strongly underlines the 
applicability of Fermi liquid theory in this temperature regime from the zero field resistivity 
analysis.  The Sommerfeld coefficient as given for free electron model34 is γ = π2NkB/2TF 
where N is the total charge carriers calculated for one mole of molecule. Bi4O4S3 is the 
normalized formula for 50% SO4 deficient Bi6O8S5 so taking the molecular weight of 
Bi6O8S5-0.5SO4 or Bi6O6S4.5 and using the calculated density 7.62 gm/cm3, the Sommerfeld 
constant comes out to be ~ 1.113 mJ/K2 mol.  It needs to be pointed out that our estimation of 
Sommerfeld coefficient is smaller than the value reported by Hiroshi et al from specific heat 
measurements which is ~2.8 mJ/K2 mol.5 
To test the potentiality of BiS2 based superconductors towards applications, in the 
following we discuss the basic pinning and vortex activation characteristics of Bi4O4S3.  The 
broadening of the resistive transition under applied magnetic field is understood in terms of a 
dissipation of energy caused by the motion of vortices in the mixed state. This interpretation 
is based on the fact that for the low-resistance region, the lossy behavior is caused by the 
creep of vortices which is modeled as Arhenius type thermally activated behavior.  This is 
simply described by ρ(T, B) = ρ0exp(-U0/kBT).  Here, U0 is the flux-flow activation energy, 
that can be obtained from the slope of the linear parts of an Arrhenius plot and ρ0 is a field-
independent pre-exponential factor.  Investigations of high-Tc superconductors and artificial 
multilayers have showed that the activation energy exhibits different power-law dependences 
on a magnetic field, i.e. U0(H) ∝ H-n.36-38 The values of U0 (Figure 8), are deduced from the 
limited temperature intervals below Tc, in which the data of the Arrhenius plot of ρ(T) yield 
straight lines. The Arrhenius plots are shown in Figure 8 and activation energy in inset. The 


straight-line behavior over 5 decades of the resistivity data validates the thermally activated 
flux flow (TAFF)-process as described by the Arrhenius law. The best fit of the experimental 
data ρ(T)|B=const  yields values of the activation energy, ranging from U0/kB  ~ 121 K in low 
magnetic field (0.01T) down to ~ 9.75 K in the high field region (1T) (Inset Fig. 8). The 
value of the exponent n in the power law equation U0(B) ~B-n is ~0.3 for H < 0.1.  On the 
other hand, Bi4O4S3 shows a much stronger field dependence of the activation energy in the 
high magnetic field region with the value of n ~1.99 for H > 0.1T.  
 
Conclusions 
In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized a series of BiS2 layer based Bi6O4S4(SO4)1-x 
superconductors with varying SO4 concentration.  The optimally doped superconducting 
sample Bi4O4S3 has transition temperature 5.3 K which is the highest Tc reported for this 
compound. The crystal structure establishes the increase in the c-axis for superconducting 
sample to that of the parent Bi6O8S5 that relates to the bending of Bi2-S2-Bi2 bond in the 
BiS2 layer. The upper critical field was estimated ~2.75T for ρonset and zero temperature 
coherence length ξGL(0) ~ 110 Å for Hc2(ρonset). The pinning potential U0 scales as B−0.3 for B 
< 0.1T.  Hall measurements confirm dominance of electronic conduction and in conjuction 
with thermoelectric power data, the Sommerfeld’s constant is estimated to be  ~ 1.113 mJ/K2 
mol.  The energy gap calculated through rf susceptibility establishes this system to be 
strongly coupled superconductor and the data fits well for an isotropic S wave gap.
