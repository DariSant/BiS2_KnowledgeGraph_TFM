Abstract.
In this paper, we systematically study the electron doping eﬀect in a new
BiS2-based system Sr1−xLaxFBiS2(0 ≤x ≤0.7) through multiple techniques of X-ray
diﬀraction, electrical transport, magnetic susceptibility, and Hall eﬀect measurements.
The parent compound SrFBiS2 is found to possess a semiconducting-like ground state,
with thermally activation energy Eg ∼38 meV. By the partial substitution of La for
Sr, superconductivity emerges when x > 0.3, reaching its maximal superconducting
transition temperature Tc ∼3.5 K at x = 0.55. In the normal state of superconducting
samples, it is clearly seen that there exists a crossover from metallic to semiconducting
state below a temperature Tmin, which shifts to lower temperatures with increasing
La content. Based on these measurements, the associated electronic phase diagram of
Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system has thus been established.

Electronic phase diagram in the new BiS2-based Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system

1. Introduction
In the last couple of decades, the discovery of a series of new superconducting
compounds with relatively low transition temperatures Tc yet displaying some unique
properties, has triggered sustained research interest in the community of condensed
matter physics[1, 2, 3].
In particular, these compounds in some cases have led to
the unveiling of entire new families of surperconducting materials[3, 4, 5] with Tc far
above the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS) limit[6]. Interestingly, with few exceptions,
these compounds possess a layered crystal structure, and exhibit exotic superconducting
properties and complex physical features.
Very recently, a novel superconductor Bi4O4S3 with Tc of 8.6 K has been
reported[7, 8], which consists of a layered crystal structure built from the stacking
of Bi2S4 superconducting layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1−x block layers.
Immediately after
this work, several new BiS2-based superconductors, LnO1−xFxBiS2(Ln=La, Ce, Pr,
Nd)[9, 10, 11, 12, 13], which are composed of Bi2S4 layers and Ln2O2 layers, have thus
been discovered, with Tc as high as 10 K. Evidently, these compounds share a common
BiS2 layer, which serves as the basic building blocks of this new superconducting family.
This feature is reminiscent of the situation encountered in the cuprate and pnictides
superconductors, in which superconductivity arises predominantly from the CuO2 planes
and Fe2Pn2 layers, respectively.
However these BiS2-based layered superconductors
display a wealth of similarities to the iron pnictides, the diﬀerences are also manifest.
For instance, the parent compound of LnFeAsO shows an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
transition and/or a structural phase transition[14] and superconductivity emerges from
the suppression of this AFM order by chemical doping or pressure. In contrast, the
parent compound LnOBiS2 displays no magnetic/structural transition, implying that
magnetism is of less relevance to superconductivity in BiS2-based systems.
On the
other hand, it is noted that superconductivity is in close proximity to an insulating
normal state for the BiS2-based compounds [12]. Yet for the discovered superconducting
materials, superconductivity grows from a metallic normal state.
More recently, a new BiS2 based superconductor Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 (x=0.5) has been
synthesized and studied[15, 16]. This compound is iso-structural to LaOBiS2, where
the [Ln2O2]2−layer is replaced by iso-charged [Sr2F2]2−block, in analogy to the case
of LaOFeAs and SrFFeAs. The parent compound SrFBiS2 is a semiconductor, and the
50% substitution of La for Sr induces superconductivity with Tc of 2.8 K.
To
date,
most
studies
about
BiS2-based
systems
have
focused
on
their
electronic structures[17], superconducting transition temperature[18] and the pairing
symmetry[19, 20], with only few reports on the study of their electronic phase diagrams.
In this paper, we report the successful synthesis and the detailed characterization
of a series of La-doped Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 samples.
We ﬁnd that superconductivity is
successfully induced by La doping when x > 0.3, with maximal Tc of 3.5 K at x = 0.55,
above which Tc shows less doping dependence. Interestingly, for the superconducting
samples, their normal state undergoes a metal to semiconductor transition/crossover

at Tmin, which shifts to lower temperatures with increasing La content.
For all
superconducting samples studied, a strong diamagnetic signal was observed, conﬁrming
the bulk superconductivity.
As a consequence, we established the electronic phase
diagram of this Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system based on our experimental data.
2. Experiment
The polycrystalline samples of Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 (0≤x≤0.7) used in this study were
synthesized by two-step solid state reaction method. The detailed synthesis procedures
can be found in our previous report[15].
Crystal structure characterization was
performed by powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA
diﬀractometer with CuKα radiation and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters
were obtained by Rietveld reﬁnements. The electrical resistivity was measured with a
standard four-terminal method between 300 K to 0.4 K in a commercial Quantum
Design PPMS-9 system with a 3He refrigeration insert. The Hall eﬀect measurements
were also performed in this system. The temperature dependence of d.c. magnetization
was measured by a Quantum Design MPMS-5.
3. Results and Discussion
Figure 1 (a) shows the room temperature powder XRD patterns of the Sr1−xLaxFBiS2
samples. The main diﬀraction peaks of these samples can be well indexed based on a
tetragonal cell structure with the P4/nmm space group, expect for some extra minor
peaks arising from the possible impurity phase of Bi2S3 (note that x =0.4 sample
shows a single phase only). Fig. 1(b) displays the (102) and (004) diﬀraction peaks
on an enlarged scale. It is clearly seen that the (004) peak for La-doped samples shifts
systematically towards higher 2θ angles with respect to that in the parent compound
(x = 0), while the (102) peak exhibits much less doping dependence. This observation
is consistent with the variation of the lattice parameters at room temperature, as shown
in Fig. 1(c), where the c-axis decreases quickly as x grows, while the a-axis is nearly
independent of the La content. These suggest that La atoms are indeed incorporated into
the lattice, resulting in the decrease in the cell volume. Similar feature was also reported
in the case of LaO1−xFxBiS2[11]. To obtain the actual content of La impurities, the EDX
measurements (not shown here) are performed in a single crystal grain of polycrystalline
sample for all La-doped samples. Those results suggest that the real La content in all
doped samples is very close to the nominal La concentration.
The temperature evolution of the resistivity ρ(T) for all samples studied is
summarized in Fig.
2.
The parent compound SrFBiS2, which has been broadly
studied in the literature[15, 16], is a semiconductor with room temperature resistivity
of ∼5×102mΩ·cm. This room temperature value is about two orders of magnitude
larger than that of iron-based superconductors with semi-metallicity[4]. No anomaly
in resistivity is observed down to 2 K, contrasting with the prominent kink structure

associated with the AFM phase transition in LnFeAsO systems[14].
Remarkably,
the thermal energy Eg extracted from the ﬁtting to the thermal activation formula
ρ(T) = ρ0 exp(Eg/kBT) at the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K, is about 38.2
meV for the parent compound. When 30% of La is introduced, however, the resistivity
decreases sharply yet remains semiconducting-like with its negative T-coeﬃcient of
the resistivity.
Note that the thermal activation energy Eg increases to 58 meV,
which was ascribed to the impurity phase of Bi2S3 with sulfur deﬁciency[21].
As
x further increases to 0.4, resistivity shows semiconducting behavior before a sharp
superconducting transition with T onset
c
(the onset temperature at which the resistivity
starts to drop) ∼2.0 K sets up, as clearly seen in the low-T enlarged plot in Fig. 2(b).
This result is comparable to the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, where the normal state shows
semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes a superconducting transition below 10 K[9].
The Eg ﬁtted from high temperature decreases from 30 meV for x =0.4 to 8.6 meV for
x =0.5, suggesting the decrease of gap size due to electron doping. The highest T onset
c
is observed to be 3.5 K at x = 0.55. Interestingly, for the superconducting samples,
there occurs a crossover from a metallic to semiconducting state as the temperature is
lowered below Tmin. While the Tmin shifts progressively towards lower temperatures with
increasing La concentration up to x=0.7, superconducting Tc remains almost unchanged
above the doping level of 0.55, as observed in the Fig. 2(b).
To further conﬁrm the bulk nature of the observed superconductivity, we performed
the d.c.
magnetic susceptibility measurement with both zero ﬁeld cooling (ZFC)
and ﬁeld cooling (FC) modes under 5 Oe magnetic ﬁeld for the superconducting
samples, as depicted in Fig. 3. For all superconducting samples, strong diamagnetic
signals are observed and the Tc values determined from the magnetic susceptibility
are overall consistent well with the resistivity data. The estimated volume fraction of
superconducting shielding from ZFC data is close to 30%. Note that the Meissner volume
fraction estimated by FC data also exceeds 15%, which is larger than the previous report
in LaO1−xFxBiS2 system[22].
Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity for x =0.55 sample under
various magnetic ﬁelds below 5 K. It can be seen that T onset
c
is about 3.5 K at zero ﬁeld.
With increasing magnetic ﬁelds, T onset
c
is gradually suppressed and the superconducting
transition becomes obviously broader. Above 0.3 T, T onset
c
becomes robust in ﬁelds and
its value shows nearly no changes at around 2.6 K. For B = 2 T, however, the low
temperature resistivity increases rapidly, but a slight drop at 2.6 K is still detectable.
The inset shows the temperature dependence of upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc(T) below 5
K, determined by using 99% normal state resistivity criterion. The µ0Hc(T) is nearly
linear with temperature decreasing at low ﬁeld but becomes constant as H is over 0.4
T. This may be ascribed to the residual Cooper pairs existing in the BiS2-based system,
where similar behaviors were also reported in the Bi4O4S3 system[23]. According to
the conventional one band WHH formula[24] µ0Hc2(0) = −0.69Tc0(∂Hc2/∂T)|Tc0, the
upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2 estimated is about 1.44 T. Apparently, this result from one
band WHH model does not match to our experimental data, indicating the mutilband

superconductivity in the Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system.
Recently, the calculations[25] have
claimed that in BiS2 systems, the triplet pairing interaction is so strong that it may
become dominant. Therefore, it would be intriguing to study its low-lying quasiparticle
excitations in the present system[26, 27].
Recently, the ﬁrst principles calculations[20] suggested a charge density wave
instability or an enhanced correlation eﬀect in this system. In order to study its normal
state properties and obtain some useful insights into such a putative instability, the Hall
eﬀect measurement was performed. Fig. 5 shows the temperature dependence of RH for
the superconducting samples as x ≥0.4. The inset gives the magnetic ﬁeld dependence
of the transverse resistivity ρxy at various temperatures for the representative x =0.55
sample. In the main panel of Fig. 5, the positive RH throughout the entire temperature
range is observed and displays a weak temperature dependence above 50 K for x
=0.4 sample, suggesting the dominant hole-carriers regardless of electron doping in
this compound.
In contrast, as x ≥0.5, the RH in the whole temperature region
is negative and indicates that the electron-type charge carriers is dominant for those
compounds. Moreover, their RH are seen to be T-independent at high temperatures
and drop drastically below 100 K. The sign change of RH from positive to negative
may be ascribed to the suddenly topology change of the Fermi Surface according to the
calculations[28, 29]. On the other hand, as shown in the inset of Fig. 5, the magnetic
ﬁeld dependence of ρxy shows weak nonlinear behaviors at low temperatures for x =0.55.
The results are consistent with the multi-band eﬀects in the present system, similar to
the case of CeOFBiS2[12]. However, another possibility of the spin (charge) density wave
(SDW/CDW) formation[30] can not be ruled out at this stage, as the similar sharp drop
in RH was also observed in the iron-based superconductors below AFM transition[31].
On the basis of the above experimental ﬁndings, the electronic phase diagram
of Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system is mapped out in Fig. 6. The parent compound SrFBiS2
is a semiconductor.
With La doping on Sr sites, superconductivity emerges as x
≥0.3 and it reaches a maximal Tc ∼3.5 K at x=0.55.
Meanwhile, a crossover
from metallic to semiconducting-like behavior is observed in the normal state of the
superconducting samples, with the resistivity minimum Tmin shifting progressively
towards lower temperatures with doping.
The above phase diagram of Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system distinguishes itself from those of
LnO1−xFxBiS2 systems in several aspects. First, the parent compound of the former is
a semiconductor[15] while the latter is a bad metal[12]. Second, by electron doping,
the resistivity decreases with the doping concentration in Sr1−xLaxFBiS2, which is
distinct from LnO1−xFxBiS2[12] and La1−xMxOBiS2 (M=Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) systems[32],
where resistivity shows the opposite trend with the electron concentration. Third, no
metal to semiconductor transition/crossover has been observed in LnO1−xFxBiS2 and
La1−xMxOBiS2 systems.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have successfully synthesized a series of BiS2-based Sr1−xLaxFBiS2
polycrystalline samples.
Through the measurements of resistivity and magnetic
susceptibility, the parent compound was found to be semiconducting-like with an
thermal activation energy Eg ∼38 meV. Via the partial La doping on Sr sites, however,
the resistivity decreases sharply, and ultimately superconductivity emerges as x > 0.3
and it reaches Tc of 3.5 K at the optimal level of x = 0.55. The superconducting samples
undergo a metal to semiconductor transition/crossover below Tmin, which is seen to be
gradually suppressed with further doping whilst Tc remains nearly unchanged above the
optimal doping. Hall eﬀect measurements for the La-doped samples conﬁrm that the
sign change of RH from positive to negative may be ascribed to the suddenly topology
change of the Fermi Surface. A drop in RH and the non-linear transverse resistivity ρxy
with ﬁeld are associated with the multi-band eﬀect or a CDW instability. According to
these measurements, an electronic phase diagram is thus established.
