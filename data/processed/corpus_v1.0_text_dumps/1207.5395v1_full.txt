Abstract 
Polycrystalline sample of the new layered superconductor Bi4O4S3 is successfully 
synthesized by solid-state reaction method by using Bi, S and Bi2O3 powders with one 
step reaction. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc
onset=4.5 K), the zero 
resistance transition temperature (Tc0=4.07 K) and the diamagnetic transition 
temperature (4.02 K at H=10 Oe) were confirmed by electrical transport and magnetic 
measurements. Also, our results indicate a typical type II-superconductor behavior. In 
addition, a large thermoelectric effect was observed with a dimensionless 
thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of about 0.03 at 300K, indicating Bi4O4S3 can be a 
potential thermoelectric material.

To study the layered materials is one of the strategies for exploring new 
superconductors. The discoveries of superconductivity with high superconducting 
transition temperatures in cuprates1-4 and oxypnictides5-8 are good examples. Very 
recently, 
Mizuguchi 
et 
al., 
reported 
the 
superconductivity 
in 
layered 
Bismuth-oxysulfide Bi4O4S3
9 with Tc0=4.5 K. Just ten days later, S. Li et al., reported 
the measurements of resistivity, Hall effect and magnetization of Bi4O4S3.10 Their 
results indicate an exotic multi-band behavior and show the feature of 
superconducting pairing in one dimensional chains. Structurally, Bi4O4S3 is composed 
of stacking of Bi4O4(SO4)1-x and Bi2S4 layers. The BiS2 layer is a basic unit as the 
Cu-O layer in Cu-based superconductors1-4 and the Fe-An (An=P, As, Se, Te) layer in 
oxypnictides.5-8 The Bi4O4S3 superconductor as a new member in the layered 
superconducting family may stimulate further studies on the materials with BiS2 layer. 
The reported preparations for Bi4O4S3 superconductor contains two steps.9-10 
Firstly, the Bi2S3 polycrystalline powder should be prepared using solid-state reaction 
by Bi powder and S grain. And then, the obtained Bi2S3 powder, Bi2O3 powder and S 
grains were used to prepare Bi4O4S3 polycrystalline by solid-state reaction. In this 
letter, we report a one-step solid-state reaction method for the superconducting 
Bi4O4S3. Our measurement confirms Bi4O4S3 is a typical type II-superconductor by 
magnetization measurement. In addition, we report a large thermoelectric effect in this 
compound, which may excite further studies of thermoelectric effect in those 
compounds with BiS2 layers for the purpose of potential applications.  
The Bi, S and Bi2O3 powders in stoichiometric ratio were fully mixed and ground, 
and then pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed in an evacuated silica tube. The 
tube was heated for 10 hours at 510 °C. The obtained pellets were ground again and 
the above treatment was repeated. Finally, polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 were obtained. The 
room-temperature crystal structure and lattice constants were determined by powder 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips X’pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation. The electronic 
and thermal transport measurements were performed in a Quantum Design physical 
property measurement system (PPMS), and the magnetization measurement was 
performed on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) system. 
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern for the Bi4O4S3 polycrystalline. The Bragg 
diffractions can be indexed using the tetragonal structure with the space group of 
I4/mmm. The lattice parameters are obtained by fitting the powder XRD pattern by 


using the Rietica software,11 and the obtained lattice constants a, b and c are 
a=b=0.3978nm, c= 4.107nm, respectively, which are in consistence with the reported 
results.9 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the Bi4O4S3 
polycrystalline measured by a standard four-probe method under a zero magnetic field. 
As seen from Fig. 2, the Bi4O4S3 has a metallic behavior in the normal state, and the 
magnitude of the resistivity is slightly less than that reported in Ref. 9 in the whole 
measurement temperature region. When the sample was cooled down to 5 K, the 
resistivity has an abrupt drop due to the occurrence of superconductivity. The inset of 
Fig. 2 shows the low temperature resistivity of Bi4O4S3 at different applied magnetic 
field (H). The superconducting transition temperature (Tc
onset) and zero resistivity 
temperature (Tc0) of the sample are determined to be 4.5 K and 4.02 K at H=0T, 
respectively, and the superconducting transition width is determined to be 0.3 K 
according to 10–90% of the normal state resistivity, such a narrow width indicates the 
homogeneity of the sample. The Tc
onset and Tc0 shift to lower temperatures with the 
increase of H. 
The superconductivity was also proved by the magnetic measurements shown in 
Fig. 3. The diamagnetism in the low-temperature region further confirms the 
existence of superconductivity, and the steep transition in the M (T) curve indicates 
that the sample is rather homogeneous. The superconducting diamagnetic transition 
begins at 4.02 K, defined by the onset point of the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and 
field-cooling (FC) curves. It is consistent with the Tc0 obtained from the resistance 
measurement. The smaller magnetization value for FC is likely due to the complicated 
magnetic flux pinning effects.12 The value of −4πχ at 2 K is about 33%. The top inset 
of Fig. 3 shows the magnetization hysteresis loop of Bi4O4S3 at T=2K. The shape of 
the M (H) curve indicates that Bi4O4S3 is a typical type-II superconductor. The bottom 
inset of Fig. 3 shows the initial M (H) curves of the Bi4O4S3 in the low-field region at 
2 K, which allows us to estimate the lower critical field values (Hc1) at 2 K. At low 
fields, the M (H) isotherm is linear with H, as expected for a BCS type-II 
superconductor. The estimated Hc1 (2 K) value is about 7.4 Oe, defined by the point 
where the curve deviates from linearity (marked by the arrow in the inset of Fig.3). 
The thermal transport measurement results which are containing the Seebeck 
coefficient (S), electrical resistivity ρ, thermal conductivity κ are shown in Fig. 4. The 


k (T) shows a broad peak at around 25K. The origin is unknown at present. The S (T) 
is negative in the whole measurement temperature region, indicating the major 
carriers are electron-like. It is in agreement with the Hall measurement results.10 The 
S (T) is linearly dependent with temperature when T is less than 50K, above which the 
S (T) is less temperature dependent. It results in a broad slope change at ~ 100K. In 
the similar temperature region, a broad minimum in the Hall coefficient RH(T) was 
observed.10 It indicates the temperature dependence of S (T) is mainly governed by 
the evolution of charge carrier density with temperature. The efficiency of a 
thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT 
(ZT=S2T/ρκ). Hence, a good thermoelectric material should have high S, low κ and ρ. 
The dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) for Bi4O4S3 is presented in Fig. 4(b). Due to 
low resistivity, and relatively small thermal conductivity, the ZT value of our sample 
at 300K reaches about 0.03. The ZT value at 300K is comparable to the Fe-based 
superconductors LaFePO1-xFx and LaFeAsO1-xFx,13 while larger than cuprates 
HgBaCaCuO (1223) and BiSrCaCuO (2212)14 by a few magnitudes. It is interesting 
to modify the S (T), κ (T) and ρ (T) to increase the ZT value so as to meet the 
requirements of practical applications, for instance, via chemical doping. 
In summary, polycrystalline samples of the new layered superconductor Bi4O4S3 
are prepared by a one-step solid-state reaction method using Bi, S and Bi2O3 powders. 
The electronic and magnetic measurements show that the onset transition temperature 
and zero resistance transition temperature are Tc
onset=4.5 K and Tc0=4.02 K, 
respectively. Our M (H) measurement indicates Bi4O4S3 is a typical type 
II-superconductor. The large thermoelectric effect with ZT=0.03 at room temperature, 
which may open a new scope for pursuing new thermoelectric materials with large ZT 
values.
