Exotic superconductivity has often been discovered in materials with a 
layered (two-dimensional) crystal structure. The low dimensionality can affect the 
electronic structure and can realize high transition temperatures (Tc) and/or 
unconventional superconductivity mechanisms. As standard examples, we now 
have two types of high-Tc superconductors. The first group is the Cu-oxide 
superconductors whose crystal structure is basically composed of a stacking of 
spacer (blocking) layers and superconducting CuO2 layers.1-4 The second group is 
the Fe-based superconductors which also possess a stacking structure of spacer 
layers and superconducting Fe2An2 (An = P, As, Se, Te) layers.5-13 In both systems, 
dramatic enhancements of Tc are achieved by optimizing the spacer layer structure, 
for instance, a variety of composing elements, spacer thickness, and carrier doping 
levels with respect to the superconducting layers. In this respect, to realize 
higher-Tc superconductivity, other than Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors, 
the discovery of a new prototype of layered superconductors needs to be achieved. 
Here we show superconductivity in a new bismuth-oxysulfide layered compound 
Bi4O4S3. Crystal structure analysis indicates that this superconductor has a layered 
structure composed of stacking of Bi4O4(SO4)1-x and Bi2S4 layers; the parent 
compound (x = 0) is Bi6O8S5. Band calculation suggests that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is 
metallic while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) is a band insulator with Bi3+. Furthermore, the Fermi 
level for Bi4O4S3 is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 
6p orbital within the BiS2 layer. The BiS2 layer is a basic structure which provides 
another universality class for layered superconducting family, and this opens up a 
new field in the physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.

In the 100 years since the discovery of superconductivity, many 
superconductors have been discovered. In the early stages, new superconductors had 
been found in metallic compounds such as Nb-Ti alloy and Nb3Sn. In 1986, Bednorz 
and Müller reported high-Tc superconductivity in (La,Ba)2CuO4 at 30K.1 After this 
discovery, a dramatic increase of Tc was achieved by optimizing the spacer layers and 
the number of CuO2 planes, for example in YBa2Cu3Ox (Tc > 90 K), Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3Ox (Tc 
> 110 K) and HgBa2Ca2Cu3Ox (Tc > 130 K).2-4 The high-Tc Cu-oxide (cuprate) 
superconductors provided us with some strategies to explore new high-Tc 
superconductors, such as layered (low-dimensional) crystal structures, insulator-metal 
boundaries, electronic correlations and the correlation between magnetism and 
superconductivity. 
After the discovery of the cuprate family, some layered superconductors were 
discovered. Layered magnesium diboride MgB2 exhibits a comparably high Tc of 39K 
although it is a simple binary compound.14 Layered nitride HfNCl and ZrNCl are band 
insulators. However, when electrons are doped by intercalation of ions into the 
interlayer site, an insulator-metal transition occurs and a superconductivity of Tc > 25 K 
is achieved.15,16 As in the Hf-nitride superconductor, superconductivity in layered 
Co-oxide NaxCoO2 is achieved by intercalation of H3O+ ions into the interlayer site.17 
Most recently, high-Tc superconductivity was discovered in Fe-based compounds. 
Kamihara and Hosono et al. reported that the antiferromagnetic metal LaFeAsO became 
superconducting (Tc > 26 K) when the O was partially substituted by F.5 Soon after the 
discovery, SmFeAsO1-xFx was reported to be a superconductor with Tc > 55 K.6,7 To date, 
over 50 Fe-based superconductors with a layered structure, basically composed of 
superconducting layers of Fe-pnictogen (Fe2As2 or Fe2P2) or Fe-chalcogen (Fe2Se2 or 
Fe2Te2) layers and spacer layers, have been discovered.8-13 As introduced here, 
discovery of a new layered superconductor provides us with a new research field on 
physics and chemistry. If a new superconducting layer was discovered, we  have a 
challenge for increasing Tc or exploring new superconductors by changing the spacer 
layer or alignment of superconducting and spacer layers. In this letter, we show 
superconductivity in a new layered superconductor bismuth-oxysulfide Bi4O4S3. 
Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared using a conventional solid 
state reaction method. Bi2S3, Bi2O3 powders and S grains were ground, pelletized, 
sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 510 ºC for 10 h. The product was 
well-ground, pelletized and annealed at 510 ºC for 10 h in an evacuated quartz tube 
again. 
Firstly, we show the physical properties of the new superconductor Bi4O4S3.

Figure 1a shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility () for Bi4O4S3 
from 10 to 2 K. Both zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) data begins to 
decrease below 6 K as indicated by an arrow in the inset of fig. 1a. A large diamagnetic 
signal is observed below 4.5K in the ZFC curve. The value of 4(ZFC) at 2 K exceeds 
-1, indicating that the shielding volume fraction at 2 K is almost 100 %. Namely, 
Bi4O4S3 is a bulk superconductor. Figure 1b shows the temperature dependence of 
resistivity from 300 to 2 K for Bi4O4S3. Resistivity linearly decreases with cooling and 
begins to drop below ~8.6 K. An enlarged graph is displayed in the inset of fig. 1b. As 
indicated by an arrow in the inset, below 8.6 K, a decrease of resistivity, corresponding 
to the onset of superconducting transition, is clearly observed and resistivity reaches 
zero below 4.5 K. Temperature dependence of resistivity for Bi4O4S3 under magnetic 
fields up to 5 T is displayed in fig. 1c. The superconducting states are destroyed by 
applying high magnetic fields. The increase of resistivity with applying magnetic fields 
would be due to the magnet resistance of impurity phase of Bi. To investigate the 
temperature - magnetic field phase diagram for superconductivity of Bi4O4S3, we 
plotted Tc
onset and Tc
zero with the respective applied magnetic fields in fig. 1d. The Tc
onset 
at high magnetic fields was estimated as indicated by an arrow in the inset of fig. 1d. 
The Tc
zero linearly decreases with increasing magnetic field. By a linear extrapolation, 
the irreversible field 0Hirr(0) is estimated to be ~1 T. The upper critical field 0Hc2(0) 
was estimated to be ~21 T using the WHH theory,18 which gives 0Hc2(0) = 
-0.69Tc(d0Hc2 / dT)|Tc, with a sloop of Tc
onset for H ≥ 1.5 T. To summarize the physical 
properties of Bi4O4S3, the Tc
onset and Tc
zero are 8.6 K and 4.5 K at 0 T, respectively. The 
broadness of the transition is probably caused by an inhomogeneity of the local 
structure and/or career doping level. 
Next, we show the crystal structure obtained by Rietveld refinement of the 
powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and density functional theory (DFT) 
calculations. At first, by indexing the observed peaks except for small peaks of impurity 
phases of Bi2S3 and Bi, we obtained the I-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice 
parameters of a = 3.9592(1) and c = 41.241(1) Å. The extinction rule suggested that the 
I4/mmm and I-42m space groups were the candidates. By fitting the XRD pattern with 
only Bi atoms at the Bi1, Bi2 and Bi3 sites in Table 1, the reliability factor of Rwp = 
26.5 % was obtained. Furthermore, by adding S atoms at the S1, S2 and S3 sites in 
Table 1 to the refinement, Rwp = 16.0 % was achieved. Since both models for these 
space groups are completely identical, we selected higher-symmetric I4/mmm. Because 
it is difficult to determine the O sites using only XRD data, we performed structural 
optimization using DFT calculations. Additionally, we have confirmed the structural 


5 
 
stability using molecular dynamics simulation. The atomic positions of Bi and S, 
determined by the XRD pattern, were only stable when the SO4 ions occupied z = 0 and 
0.5. By using the structural model, we performed Rietveld refinement. Figure 2a shows 
the XRD pattern of this sample and the result of Rietveld refinement (Rwp = 14.41 %). 
The obtained atomic parameters and the site occupancy are summarized in Table 1. As 
shown in Fig. 2b, the XRD pattern is well-fitted at high angle region. A schematic 
image of the final crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2c. The layered structure is 
composed of Bi2S4 layers, Bi2O2 layers and SO4. The fluorite-type Bi2O2 layer is one of 
the well-known layers in the I4/mmm or P4/nmm tetragonal layered structures. In fact, 
Bi2O2SO4 is a known compound. The rock-salt-type Bi2S4 layer structure has been 
found only in ReOBiS2 (Re = Ce, Gd and Dy) with the P4/nmm space group.19 Figure 
2d is a schematic image of the Bi2S4 layer projected along the c axis. The Bi and S 
atoms form square lattices. When all the sites are fully occupied, the atomic 
composition should be Bi6O8S5, namely Bi6O4S4(SO4). If the occupancy of the SO4 site 
is 50 %, the composition is Bi4O4S3. Therefore, we speculate that there are defects at the 
SO4 site in our Bi4O4S3 superconducting sample, because defects of molecules or ions at 
the interlayer site are often observed in layered compounds.  
Finally, we discuss the band structure of the present material. It is found that 
Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is metallic while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) is band insulator with Bi3+. Figure 3 
shows the band structure for x = 0.5 (Bi4O4S3) obtained using the Wien2k package 
adopting the lattice structure obtained as above.20 The Fermi level lies within the bands 
which mainly originate from the Bi 6p orbitals. In particular, the Fermi level is just on 
the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS2 layer. 
Focusing on the contribution from the BiS2 layer, it is found that the band structure near 
the Fermi level consists of px and py orbital contributions, which in itself have 
quasi-one-dimensional nature, but mixes around the R point to result in a two 
dimensional band structure. The width of these Bi p bands is about 3eV, which is 
comparable to the width of the 3d bands of the high-Tc cuprates or the iron-based 
superconductors, and this, along with the low dimensional nature of the band structure 
suggests that electron correlation effects may be playing some role in the occurrence of 
superconductivity. 
As reported here, superconductivity in the new layered superconductor Bi4O4S3 
is realized within the BiS2 layers upon electron doping. By changing the spacer layers, 
we will be able to obtain various BiS2-based new superconductors. We believe that the 
BiS2-based family will open a new field in physics and chemistry for low-dimensional 
superconductors as have cuprate and Fe-based superconductors.

Methods 
Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared using a conventional solid 
state reaction method. All the chemicals were purchased from Kojundo Chemical Lab. 
At first, Bi2S3 was prepared by reacting Bi (99.99% grain) and S (99.9% grain) in an 
evacuated quartz tube above 500 ºC. Starting materials of Bi2S3, Bi2O3 (99.9% powder) 
and S were ground, pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 510 ºC 
for 10 h. The product was well-ground, pelletized and annealed at 510 ºC for 10 h in an 
evacuated quartz tube again. In the case that the Bi4O4S3 sample was heated above 550 
ºC, SO2 gas was produced. If you try to synthesize this material, please be careful not to 
heat the sample sealed in an evacuated tube at high temperature to avoid explosion. 
Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility from 10 to 2 K after both 
zero-field cooling (ZFC) and fieled cooling (FC) was measured using a superconducting 
quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied magnetic field of 
9.3 Oe. Temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 to 2 K was measured using the 
four terminals method. The Tc
onset was defined to be a temperature where the resistivity 
deviates from the linear-extrapolation of normal-state resistivity as shown in the inset of 
fig. 1b. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected by RIGAKU x-ray 
diffractometer with Cu-K radiation using the 2- method. The diffraction peaks were 
indexed by the software X-Cell21 of Accelrys, Inc. The initial model of the crystal 
structure was derived from the software TOPAS of Bruker AXS, Inc. The structure was 
refined by the Rietveld-analysis program Materials Studio Reflex of Accelrys, Inc. 
Geometry optimizations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) 
methods with the program Materials Studio CASTEP22 of Accelrys, Inc. The GGA 
(generalized gradient approximation)–PBEsol (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof for solids) 
exchange-correlation functionals23 and ultrasoft pseudopotentials24 were employed. The 
energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 380.0 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack grid 
separation25 was set to approximately 0.04 Å-1. The lattice parameters were set to the 
experimental values, and the atomic positions were optimized to minimize the total 
energy. The schematic images of the crystal structure were depicted using VESTA.26 
Band structure of Bi4O4S3 shown in Fig.3 was calculated using the WIEN2k 
package.20 GGA-PBEsol exchange-correlation functional was adopted.23 512 k-points 
and RKmax = 7.0 were taken. The spin-orbit interaction was omitted.
