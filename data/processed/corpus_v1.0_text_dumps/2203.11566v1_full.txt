Abstract 
 
We studied Grüneisen parameter (γG) to investigate lattice anharmonicity in a layered BiS2-
based superconductor system REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), where in-plane chemical 
pressure was tuned by substituting the RE elements. With increasing in-plane chemical pressure, 
bulk modulus remarkably increases, and a high γG is observed for RE = Nd. The dependence of 
γG on in-plane chemical pressure exhibits a good correlation with Tc, and a higher Tc is achieved 
when γG is large for RE = Nd. In addition, γG shows a slight decrease by a decrease of F 
concentration (x) in REO1-xFxBiS2. Our results show that the anharmonic vibration of Bi along 
the c-axis is present in REO1-xFxBiS2, and the enhancement of the anharmonicity is positively 
linked to superconducting Tc and pairing mechanisms.

1.  Introduction 
 The presence of lattice anharmonicity has been one of the important issues in 
superconductors with a high transition temperature (Tc) and exotic pairing mechanisms. For 
example, anharmonicity and structural instability is essential parameter for Tc in A15-type 
superconductors [1] and rattling materials [2,3]. In addition, anharmonicity has been observed 
in MgB2 [4] and superhydrides (superconductors with hydrogen-rich compositions) [5]. 
Although anharmonic vibration is positively linked to superconductivity in [2,3,6], a theoretical 
study on a superhydride suggested that giant anharmonicity suppresses Tc in the material [7]. 
Therefore, control of anharmonicity is one of key factors for designing new superconductors 
and improving their superconducting properties. In this study, we investigate the relationship 
between superconductivity and anharmonicity in a BiS2-based layered superconductor via the 
estimation of Grüneisen parameter (γG). 
The BiS2-based superconductors, which are a layered superconductor family having an 
alternate stacking structure of blocking layer and conducting layer (BiS2 layer), were discovered 
in 2012, and many analogous BiS2-based superconductors have been synthesized [8–19]. BiS2 
layers are essential to superconductivity [20–22], and superconductivity is induced after carrier 
doping and optimization of crystal structure [17,23,24]. In particular, the importance of in-plane 
chemical pressure effect [25], which suppresses local structural disorder (local distortion) in 
BiS2 layers [25–30], has been found. One of the origins of the local disorder in the BiS2 layers 
is the presence of Bi lone pairs [27]. In addition, structural instability has been predicted 
theoretically [31]. Hence, the relationship between superconductivity and structural instability 
would be a kye factor, but the point has not been experimentally studied. On the mechanisms 
of superconductivity, recent experimental and theoretical works indicated the possibility of 
unconventional superconductivity with an anisotropic superconducting gap structure [32–36]. 
Furthermore, by focusing on the suppression of the local disorder and the improvement of 
superconducting properties by in-plane chemical pressure [25], we have revealed some 
evidences of unconventional pairing in La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)2 and Bi4O4S3 where in-plane chemical 
pressure is high enough for the suppression of local disorder: the absence of isotope effects, 
nematic superconductivity, and high upper critical fields [38–42]. 
Motivated by the background knowledges on BiS2-based superconductivity, we here focus 
on the relationship between superconductivity and lattice anharmonicity in REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE 
= La, Ce, Pr, Nd). In a related LaOBi(S,Se)2 system, which shows high thermoelectric 
properties [43,44], evolution of anharmonic vibration in BiS2 layers has been detected by 


3 
 
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) [45]. In the system, low thermal conductivity was explained 
by the enhanced anharmonicity. In addition, we recently analyzed anharmonicity in 
LaOBi(S,Se)2 by estimating γG and reproduced the trend found in the INS [46]. Since 
anharmonicity is enhanced by in-plane chemical pressure in LaOBi(S,Se)2 by Se substitution, 
we investigate the dependences of γG on in-plane chemical pressure tuned by RE ionic radii in 
REO1-xFxBiS2 in this paper. As a main conclusion, we show that anharmonicity is enhanced by 
in-plane chemical pressure and exhibits a positive correlation with Tc in REO1-xFxBiS2. 
 
2. Experimental details 
2.1 methods 
Polycrystalline samples were synthesized by solid-state reaction as described in Refs. 9 and 
26. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiments were performed at the beamline 
BL02B2, SPring-8 at a wavelength of 0.49559 Å (proposal No. 2017B1211). The SXRD 
experiments were performed with a sample rotator system at room temperature; the diffraction 
data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector (multiple 
MYTHEN system [47]) with a step size of 2θ = 0.006°. The temperature of the sample was 
controlled by nitrogen gas. The crystal structure parameters were refined using the Rietveld 
method using RIETAN-FP [48]. The image of schematic models of the crystal structures was 
produced using VESTA [49]. Specific heat was measured by relaxation method using a Physical 
Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). Longitudinal sound velocity (vL) of 
the sample was measured using an ultrasonic thickness detector (Satotech-2000C). For sound 
velocity measurements, the obtained samples were densified using high-pressure synthesis 
method with a 180-ton cubic-anvil system with a pressure of ~1.5 GPa and an annealing 
temperature of ~400 ⁰C for 15 min. 
 
2.2 Grüneisen parameter 
γG of samples was calculated using the following formula [45,50];  
𝛾G =
𝛽V𝐵𝑉mol
𝐶V
       (1) 
, where βV, B, Vmol, and CV are volume thermal expansion coefficient, bulk modulus, molar 
volume, and specific heat, respectively. The parameters needed for the estimation of γG are 
calculated as follows (formula 2–5). In the formulas, dV/dT, ρ, vL, vS, vm, θD, h, kB, n, NA, and 
M denote temperature gradient of lattice volume, density of the material, longitudinal sound 
velocity, shear sound velocity, average sound velocity, Debye temperature, Plank’s constant,

Boltzmann’s constant, number of atoms in the molecule (formula unit), Avogadro’s constant, 
and the molecular weight (per formula unit).

3.  Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 displays the SXRD patterns collected at T = 600 K and the Rietveld refinement 
results. The results suggest that the high-temperature measurements were successfully 
performed. In the refinement, tiny impurity phases of REF3 were assumed [26]. The estimated 
lattice volume (V) is plotted in Fig. 2. By formula (2) and linear fitting in Fig. 2a–2e, βV is 
estimated as 39.6, 32.9, 38.4, 37.8, and 36.4 (μK-1) for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, respectively.  
The temperature dependences of the isotropic displacement parameters (Uiso) are plotted in 
Fig. 2g–2j. As mentioned in introduction, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibits huge Uiso at the S1 site (see 
Fig. 2f), which is due to low in-plane chemical pressure [25,26]. The temperature dependence 
of Uiso for S1 is not remarkable, and the Uiso expected at T = 0 K is clearly large, which indicate 
the presence of static disorder at the S1 site. With increasing in-plane chemical pressure (by 
replacing La by Ce or Pr), Uiso at the S1 site is slightly suppressed. For RE = Nd, Uiso at the S1 
site is clearly decreased and becomes lower than that at the Bi site. Furthermore, the Uiso at the 
S1 site is expected to approach zero at T = 0 K from the temperature dependence as shown in 
Fig. 2j, suggesting the suppression of in-plane static disorder in the superconducting sample 
with RE = Nd.  
In Fig. 3a–3d, the T2 dependence of C/T are displayed, and θD is estimated as 195, 197, 222, 
and 198 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, and NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, respectively. 
The slightly larger θD for RE = Pr is consistent with a previous work [13].θD = 189 K for 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was calculated from a previous work [51]. 
The sound velocity (vL) was measured and corrected using packing factor as described in Ref. 
46. The estimated sound velocity parameters are listed in Table I. To estimate vS and vm, 


5 
 
formulas (3–5) were used. In addition, bulk modulus (B) was calculated. B remarkably increases 
with decreasing lattice constant (increasing in-plane chemical pressure) from La to Nd as shown 
in Fig. 4. B is given by B = -V0(dP/dV), where V0 is volume at initial state, and dP/dV 
corresponds to the change in internal pressure by the change in volume. Therefore, B shows 
how the material is resistant to compression. The results shown in Fig. 4 clearly indicate that 
in-plane chemical pressure modified the REOBiS2-type structure, and the huge changes in 
structural characteristics should affect lattice vibration characters in the REO1-xFxBiS2 system.  
We estimated γG for the REO1-xFxBiS2 samples to examine the evolution of anharmonicity by 
in-plane chemical pressure and the relationship with superconductivity. In addition, the 
influence of carrier doping amount is also discussed for RE = Pr and Nd. Figure 5(a) displays 
the Tc for REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.5) plotted as a function of RE3+ ionic radii [26]. In Fig. 5(b), 
the estimated γG is plotted. For γG (x = 0.5), the trend exhibits a correlation to that for Tc; Tc 
increases with increasing γG. On the basis of previous studies on LaOBiS2-xSex by INS [45] and 
γG [46], we assume that the increase in γG in REO1-xFxBiS2 systems is also originating from the 
modified vibration of Bi along the c-axis [45]. 
On the effect of carrier concentration (x) on γG in REO1-xFxBiS2, we observed a trend that γG 
for x = 0.3 is slightly smaller than that for x = 0.5 [Fig. 5(b)]. This difference would be due to 
the in-plane structural instability. As described in introduction, the in-plane local disorder in 
doped (F-substituted) REO1-xFxBiS2 is suppressed by in-plane chemical pressure. However, the 
local disorder is remarkable in non-doped or low-carrier phases as suggested in Ref. 52. As a 
fact, the in-plane local disorder in REO1-xFxBiS2 is suppressed by both F substitution and in-
plane chemical pressure, and the anharmonic vibration is enhanced in less-disordered phases, 
namely in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
We conclude that, with increasing in-plane chemical pressure, the anharmonic nature of the 
Bi vibration is enhanced, and Tc increases in the system. If the assumption is correct, we expect 
a higher Tc when the anharmonicity is further enhanced by applying a higher in-plane chemical 
pressure; for example, uniaxial strain on single crystals or strain effects in thin films would 
achieve such a situation. To clarify the nature of lattice vibration in REO1-xFxBiS2 in detail, INS 
experiments are desired. In addition, further understanding of electronic states will be helpful 
for understanding the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiS2-based systems because the 
enhancement of anharmonic nature generally enhances electron-phonon coupling [2]. 
Investigation on lattice anharmonicity in BiS2-based systems will open new pathway to develop 
exotic superconductors where anharmonic vibration plays an essential role on pairing.

4.  Conclusion 
We have investigated Grüneisen parameter (γG) of REO1-xFxBiS2 with different RE ions and 
carrier concentrations through the measurements of temperature-dependent XRD, sound 
velocity, and low-temperature specific heat (θD). With increasing in-plane chemical pressure, 
bulk modulus remarkably increases, and a high γG is observed for RE = Nd. The dependence of 
γG on in-plane chemical pressure exhibits a good correlation with Tc, and a higher Tc is achieved 
when γG is large for RE = Nd. In addition, γG shows a slight decrease by a decrease of F 
concentration (x) in REO1-xFxBiS2. We propose that the anharmonic vibration of Bi along the c-
axis observed in previous inelastic neutron scattering for thermoelectric LaOBiS2-xSex is present 
in REO1-xFxBiS2, and the enhancement of the anharmonicity is positively linked to 
superconducting Tc and pairing mechanisms.

Fig. 4. Lattice constant (T = 300 K) dependence of bulk modulus (B). For REO1-xFxBiS2, lattice 
constant a becomes a good measure of in-plane chemical pressure. B for PrO0.7F0.3BiS2 has been 
reported in Ref. 50.
