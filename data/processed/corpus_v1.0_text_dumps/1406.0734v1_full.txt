Abstract 
Single crystal of La(O,F)BiSe2 was successfully grown for the first time by the CsCl flux method. 
Single crystal X-ray structural analysis clearly showed that La(O,F)BiSe2 crystalizes with space 
group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1408(2) Å, c = 14.1096(6) Å). The structure is composed of 
alternating BiSe2 and LaO layers. Magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurements showed the 
superconducting transition at 3.6 K, which is higher than that of as-grown La(O,F)BiS2. The 
structural analysis implies that La(O,F)BiSe2 is potential superconductor having higher Tc under high 
pressure.  
 
1. Introduction 
After a discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 [1], much attention has been paid for synthesizing 
the BiS2-based compounds. The BiS2-based compounds have a layered structure composed of 
superconducting BiS2 layers and charge reservoir blocking layers similar to cuprate or Fe-based 
superconductors. For the Bi4O4S3 case, it is composed of a superconducting layer Bi2S4 and a 
blocking layer Bi4O4(SO4)1-x. There are BiS2-based superconductors having another type of the 
blocking layer LaO, which is similar to that of Fe-based superconductor LaFeAsO [2]. La(O,F)BiS2 
synthesized under ambient pressure shows superconductivity with a transition temperature (Tc) of 
~2.5 K [3]. The Tc is enhanced as high as 11.5 K under high pressure [4], and this is the highest 
record of BiS2-based superconductors. BiS2-based superconductors with various types of blocking

layer have been developed up to date, such as Ln(O,F)BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) [3, 5-9], 
(La,M)OBiS2 (M = Th, Hf, Zr, Ti) [10], (Sr,La)FBiS2 [11]. Ln(O,F)BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Nd) have been 
prepared as single crystals using alkali metal chloride flux methods [12-14]. The single crystal X-ray 
structural analysis for La(O,F)BiS2 and Nd(O,F)BiS2 determined the bonding distances and angles 
precisely [11,15]. Especially in the case of Nd(O,F)BiS2, the structural investigation of different F 
contents were performed by Miura et al. [15]. They showed that the substitution of O by F results in 
the distortion of the Bi-S plane.  
 
On the other hand, modification of superconducting layers is a very challenging issue. Only 
two cases have been reported in polycrystalline samples: LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (Tc ~3.8 K) [16] and 
La(O,F)BiSe2 (Tc ~2.6 K) [17]. It is necessary to obtain the single crystal of BiSe2-based material in 
order to clarify the superconducting mechanism and precise crystal structure for design a new 
compound with higher Tc.  
 
In this study, we have succeeded in preparing single crystal of La(O,F)BiSe2 by the CsCl 
flux method and carried out various characteristic measurements including single crystal X-ray 
diffraction. Here, we discussed bonding nature and superconductivity of this compound.

2. Experimental 
2.1. Preparation of single crystals 
Single crystal of La(O,F)BiSe2 was prepared by a flux method using CsCl. The powders of La 
(Kojundo, 99.9%), Bi2O3 (Wako, 99.9%), BiF3 (Kojundo, 99.9%), Bi (Kojundo, 99.99%), Bi2Se3 
(Kojundo, 99.9%), Se (Kojundo, 99.9%) were mixed in nominal compositions of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. 
The mixed powders with 5 g of CsCl (Kojundo, 99.9%) were sealed in an evacuated quarts tube and 
heated to 880 °C in 10 h, then gradually heated up to 900 °C in 2h. The temperature was kept for 10 
h, followed by cooling to 650 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, then the sample was cooled down to room 
temperature in the furnace. The obtained materials were washed and rinsed by water, ethanol, and 
acetone in order to remove the flux material CsCl.  
 
2.2. Characterization 
Single crystal X-ray structural analysis was carried out using a Rigaku AFC11 Saturn CCD 
diffractometer with a VariMax confocal X-ray optical system for Mo K radiation ( = 0.71073 Å). 
Prior to the diffraction experiment, the crystals were cooled to 160 K in a cold N2 gas flow, in order 
to suppress thermal displacement factor. Cell refinement and data reduction were carried out by the 
program d*trek package in CrystalClear software suite [18]. The structure was solved by the direct 
method using SHELXS [19], and was refined with the program SHELXL [19] in WinGX software

package [20]. Back scattered electron (BSE) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra 
were observed using a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi SU-70, EDAX Genesis Apollo XP).  
 
Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured using a SQUID 
magnetometer (MPMS, Quantum Design) down to 2.0 K under a field of 10 Oe, and the field was 
applied parallel to the c-axis. Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was measured down to 
2.0 K, using a standard four-probe method with constant current mode by a Physical Property 
Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). The electrodes were attached in the ab-plane with 
silver paste.

3. Results and Discussion 
3.1 Crystal structure of the La(O,F)BiSe2 
BSE image of the typical single crystal is shown in Fig.1(a). The image suggests the crystal has a 
uniform composition, and no local precipitation of metal. The composition was analyzed by EDX 
point analysis at several sections of the crystal. Fig.1(b) shows a typical EDX spectrum at a point 
marked by the red cross in Fig.1(a). The averaged compositional ratio of elements is estimated to be 
La : Bi : Se : O : F = 0.98 : 0.92 : 2 : 0.50 : 0.19, in which the ratio was normalized to Se = 2. The 
atomic ratio except for O and F elements is in good agreement with the nominal composition, 
suggesting that the single crystal has a composition La(O1-xFx)BiSe2. It should be noted that the 
analysis always detected a slight excess of La in relation to Bi.  
 
The X-ray single crystal analysis was successfully performed. Details of the single-crystal 
structure analysis at 160 K and crystallographic parameters are listed in Table 1 and Table 2. The 
compound crystallizes with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a = 4.1408(2) Å, c = 14.1096(6) 
Å, and Z = 1). All atoms were located on special position and their anisotropic displacement factors 
were all positive with the similar values, appearing physically reasonable. The basic structure of this 
compound showed isostructure with La(O,F)BiS2 [3] and previously reported polycrystalline 
La(O,F)BiSe2 [17]. The ratio of O and F was estimated to be O : F = 0.82 : 0.18, namely 
La(O0.82F0.18)BiSe2, from the occupancy refinement under constrain of Occ.(O) + Occ.(F) = 1. The F 
content x is in good agreement with the F content of EDX result of x = 0.19.

A schematic illustration of the crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2(a). The crystal has an 
alternate stacking of BiSe2 pyramids and La2(O/F)2 layer similar to BiS2-based superconductors. The 
ORTEP representation is shown in Fig. 2(b). It is necessary to mention about residual peaks/holes 
around Bi and La sites. There are relatively large residual maximum densities (<~5 e-/Å3) around Bi 
and La sites even though the R1 value falls as small as ~3 %. Fig. 3 shows the precession 
photographs reconstructed from the observed single crystal diffraction data. It is clearly shown that 
no modulated structure was observed. This finding suggests that the large residual densities are 
attributed to local disorder of Bi/La-sites in its crystal structure similar to X-ray absorption 
spectroscopy results in BiS2-based materials [21]. Since the EDX result always shows La-rich 
content compare than that of Bi, one of a possibility is that a little amount of La migrates into Bi site 
as shown in Fig. 2(b) (Bi’ and La’ sites). In this model, the total occupancy and valence of Bi and La 
were constrained to keep 1.0 and +3, respectively. The final refined composition was 
La1.010(O0.82F0.18)Bi0.992Se2. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of self-disorder of Bi atoms. 
There are no considerable differences in R1 values between the case of Bi self-disorder and Bi/La 
disorder, although the lowest R1 value was obtained in the model described above.   
 
Some selected bond distances and angles are given in Fig. 2(b) and Table 3. Bi atoms are 
six coordinated and bonded with Se atoms in three kinds such as Bi-Se1, intra-plane Bi-Se2, and 
inter-plane Bi-Se2 bondings. The interatomic distance of intra-plane Bi-Se2 is 2.9317(1) Å. On the 
other hand, the inter-plane Bi-Se2 is much longer (3.3242(9) Å) and the Bi-Se1 is shorter (2.6752(8) 


 
8 
 
Å) than that of the intra-plane Bi-Se2. This tendency of bond lengths is similar to that of 
La(O,F)BiS2 [3]. The intra-plane Se-Bi-Se angle in the present crystal is 174.262(15) °. In the 
La(O,F)BiS2, it has been reported that the amount of F affects not only carrier concentration but also 
a distortion of the Bi-S plane [14]. The Bi-Se plane is more distorted than the Bi-S plane in 
La(O1-xFx)BiS2 with x ~ 0.23.  
 
 Bond valence sum (BVS) was estimated from the observed bond distances and the r0 and 
B values of nominal valence La3+, Bi3+, Se2-, O2-, F- provided by Brown [22]. The BVS values are 
also listed in Table.2. According to the refined composition La1.010(O0.82F0.18)Bi0.992Se2, the nominal 
valence summation should be +0.19, based on nominal valences. On the other hand, the BVS of Bi 
and La was estimated to be +6.11, indicating +0.11 different from charge neutrality. Both results 
indicate the refined structure is slightly cation rich, suggesting the charge neutrality should be kept 
by modification of valence state of Bi like as the result of X-ray photoemission spectroscopy [23].  
 
3.2 Superconductivity 
Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for the single crystal 
La(O,F)BiSe2. The diamagnetic signal corresponding to superconductivity appears below 3.6 K. The 
shielding and Meissner volume fraction at 2 K was estimated to be ~8 % and ~7 %, respectively. The 
inset shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity along the ab-plane in the single crystal. It 
showed a sharp resistivity drop at 3.6 K, and zero resistivity was observed at 3.2 K, in accordance 


 
9 
 
with the superconducting transition temperature Tc found in the magnetic susceptibility 
measurement.  
 
Note that the Tc is 1 K higher than that of previously reported polycrystalline result [17]. 
Currently, the reason of the Tc difference is unclear but assuming that it is attributed to the F content 
and higher crystallinity. X-ray single crystal analysis showed the corrugation in the Bi-Se layer is 
slightly larger than the Bi-S layer of the BiS2-based superconductor. A flat Bi-S plane would result in 
better hybridization of the px/py orbitals of Bi and S [15]. If the Bi-Se plane could flatten by applying 
chemical or physical pressure, such as optimizing the F-content or uniaxial compression, overlapping 
in Bi- and Se-p orbitals would be better and may realize higher Tc in this system.  
 
4. Conclusion 
Single crystals of La(O,F)BiSe2 were successfully grown by the CsCl flux method. The X-ray 
structural analysis revealed La(O,F)BiSe2 crystalized with space group P4/nmm (lattice parameters a 
= 4.1408(2) Å, c = 14.1096(6) Å). The magnetic susceptibility and resistivity measurement clearly 
showed the superconducting transition at 3.6 K. The structural analysis suggested a possibility of 
raising up the Tc if the corrugated Bi-Se layer could be flatten by applying chemical or physical 
pressure as well as BiS2-based superconductors.
