Abstract 
Here we report further investigation on the thermodynamic, and transport properties, and the first 
assessment of theoretical calculations for the BiS2-layered Bi3O2S3 superconductor. The polycrystalline 
sample is synthesized with the superconducting transition temperature of Tc
onset = 5.75 K and Tc
zero = 4.03 
K (≈Tc
mag), that drops to 3.3 K by applying hydrostatic pressure of 6 kbar. Density-of-states calculations 
give substantial hybridization between Bi, O and S, with the largest Bi component at DOS, which 
supports the idea that BiS2 layer is relevant for producing electron-phonon coupling. The electron charge 
carrier concentration of only 1.5 x 1019 cm-3 for Bi3O2S3 is additionally suggestive of strong electron-
phonon interaction in Bi-O-S system. The analysis of Seebeck coefficient results strongly suggests that 
Bi3O2S3 is a semimetal. In fact, the semimetallic or narrow band gap behavior may be general in the BiS2-
layered class of materials, including that of Bi4O4S3.

1 Introduction 
Understanding reasons for superconductivity in Bi-O-S system is important, especially since 
high-temperature superconductivity is seen in other Bi-based materials such as Ba1-xKxBiO3 and 
Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x [1].  The superconducting members of Bi-O-S system are based on BiS2-layers with 
large unit cells composed of various spacer layers. The members include Bi4O4S3 with Tc = 4.4 K, Hc2(0) ~ 
3 T, and dominant-electron concentration of ~ 2 × 1019 cm-3 at 300 K [2-4]. The enhanced density of 
states at Fermi level from Bi 6px and 6py, and the strong Fermi surface nesting of quasi-one-dimensional 
bands are predicted to play a role in Cooper pairing [2]. Theoretical tight-binding calculations on a similar 
BiS2-layer-based system of LaOBiS2 (F-doping; Tc = 10.6 K) [5] shows that dominating bands for 
electron conduction and superconductivity are those derived from four Bi 6p-S 3p orbitals that give nearly 
half-filled, electron-hole symmetric, quasi-one-dimensional bands [6] that give nesting of the Fermi 
surface. Other members of Bi-O-S system include Bi6O8S5 [7], and Bi3O2S3 [8, 9]. Most recently, critical 
temperature at Tc = 4.5 K was discovered in Bi3O2S3 [8] that appears to be an unconventional 
superconductor with a low Tc
onset = 5.8 K, upper critical field of Hc2 = 4.8 T and low electron-dominant 
carriers of ~ 1019 cm-3 [9]. This manuscript focuses on Bi3O2S3 by advancing investigations into reasons 
of superconductivity through theoretical calculations and bulk thermodynamic and transport property 
results. A schematic image of the unit cell is shown in the right inset of Figure 1a, depicting layers of 
(BiS2)2 (rock salt-type), Bi2O2 (fluorite-type) and S2. We find that Tc decreases by application of 6 kbar, 
similar to Bi4O4S3 [10]. From Seebeck coefficient results and calculations, we find that Bi3O2S3 is a 
semimetal and the band overlap is most likely in the range of 27 – 41 meV. The unusual low carrier 
concentration of only 1.5 x 1019 cm-3 obtained from Hall measurements suggests a particularly strong 
interaction and one that could presumably be strengthened significantly via charge doping, if feasible, 
leading to larger Tc for this new Bi-S-O system.   
 
2 Experimental 
Polycrystalline sample of Bi3O2S3 was prepared by a conventional solid state reaction method 
according to the literature precedent [8, 9]. The Bi2O3 powders and S pieces were weighed by targeting 
“Bi12O18S13”, fully mixed, ground and then pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed in an evacuated 
silica tube and placed in a pre-warmed furnace at 430 °C. After four hours, the sample was quenched in 
ice water. The sample was removed from the tube, reground and repressed, and then sealed in another 
quartz tube.  The tube was placed back in the pre-heated furnace at 430 °C. After 14 hours, the sample 


3 
 
was quenched down to 0 °C with ice water.  After another regrinding and pelletizing, the pellets was 
sealed in an evacuated silica tube and placed in a pre-heated furnace at 520 °C for 17 hours, and then 
quenched again. The resultant sample looked black and dense. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was 
collected by a PANalytical X’Pert PRO MPD x-ray powder diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The 
Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns was done with FullProf software suite, using the reported 
Wyckoff positions [8] and I4/mmm space group. The electrical and thermal transport measurements were 
performed in a Quantum Design (QD) Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS), using a standard 
four-probe method. Magnetization measurements were performed in a QD Magnetic Property 
Measurement System (MPMS). The application of pressure was performed in a Mcell 10 pressure cell 
(easyLab Technologies) inside the MPMS; the applied pressure was estimated from the Tc of the Pb 
manometer. First principles calculations were performed using the linearized augmented plane-wave code 
WIEN2K [11], employing the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew, Burke and 
Ernzerhof [12]. RKmax was set to 9.0, where R is the smallest muffin-tin radius and Kmax the largest 
planewave wavevector. Muffin tin radii for all calculations, in units of the Bohr radius a0, were as follows:  
Bi – 2.31, O – 1.89, S – 2.08 except for the dimerized S, which were taken as 1.8. All internal coordinates 
were optimized until forces were less than 2 mRyd/ Bohr, while lattice parameters were taken from 
experiment. 1000 or more k-points in the full Brillouin zone were used for all calculations. Spin-orbit 
coupling was included for all calculations excepting the optimization. We also performed Boltzmann 
transport calculations of the thermopower using the Boltztrap code [13]. For these calculations as many as 
40,000 k-points in the full Brillouin zone were used. 
 
3 Results and discussion 
Figure 1a shows the XRD pattern for polycrystalline Bi3O2S3, which looks very similar to that 
reported in Ref [8]. Only tiny impurity amounts of Bi2OS2 [8], Bi2S3 and Bi are present, which have also 
been taken into account for a refinement that improved the fitting. The refined lattice constants are a = 
3.9645(5) Å and c = 41.3165(4) Å. Impurity phases were estimated using the Hill and Howard method 
[14], and their total contents were less than 8% by mass.  
Temperature dependence of resistivity is shown in Fig. 1b. In zero field, Tc
onset = 5.75 K and Tc
zero 
= 4.03 K. Upon application of 1 T magnetic field it can be seen that the Tc
onset shift to lower temperature 
and the sample does not reach zero resistivity down to 2 K. Inset of Fig. 1b shows resistivity up to room 
temperature. It displays a typical metallic behavior, similar to that of Bi4O4S3[2]. Temperature

dependence of magnetic susceptibility is shown in Fig. 1c. The sharp transition in c(T) indicates that the 
sample is rather homogeneous. The value of Tc, defined by the divergence of zero-field-cooled and field-
cooled results, is about 4.1 K. The shielding volume fraction at 1.8 K is ~ 93%. Higher field 
measurements (inset of Fig. 1c) reveals that Bi3O2S3 exhibits a diamagnetic behavior without any abrupt 
drop or anomaly, indicating there is no magnetic ordering in this system. Compressing the structural 
lattice parameters by applying external pressure is believed to be an effective method of exploring the 
optimized condition for superconductivity. To this end, we have performed a pressure study of the 
temperature dependence of susceptibility for Bi3O2S3 below 5 K. The hydrostatic pressure does not 
improve the superconductivity of the sample, while on the contrary, the transition temperature Tc
mag ~ 4 K 
at ambient pressure decreases to 3.3 K at 6 kbar, as shown in Fig. 1d. Although similar Tc suppression 
was seen in Bi4O4S3 [10], further theoretical work on DOS and structural analysis at high-pressure could 
be useful for a better understanding of this effect. 
The band structure calculation of Bi3O2S3 is shown in Fig. 2a; it suggests that this material is a 
semiconductor with a very small band gap (approximately 25 meV) and substantial band degeneracy, 
particularly in the conduction bands, where a second band minimum occurs less than 50 meV above the 
primary band minimum, with all these extrema at or very near the N point. The calculated density-of-
states for this material is shown in Fig. 2b. The plot shows a comparatively heavy band just below the 
valence band maximum, and a somewhat lighter band in the conduction band. Given the Hall 
measurements indicate n-type behavior [9] (Fig. 1b inset), we focus our attention on the conduction band. 
This shows substantial hydridization between the Bi, O and S. Previous papers have argued for the 
importance of the BiS2 layers in generating electron-phonon coupling [2], and this hybridization is 
supportive of this idea. 
One natural interpretation of our experimental data in light of these plots is that Bi3O2S3 is indeed 
a narrow band semiconductor, with an extrinsic n-type doping level of approximately 1.5 x 1019 cm-3, as 
suggested by the Hall data.  However, one immediately finds two problems with this explanation.  Firstly, 
this carrier concentration is the same as found in the prior work (Ref. [9]), and were this simply a 
semiconductor such a coincidence in extrinsic doping levels would seem rather unlikely. Secondly, and 
more compellingly, the thermopower data presented in Fig. 3 shows strong evidence of semi-metallic, 
rather than semiconducting behavior. In Fig. 3 we plot the experimental Seebeck data, along with two 
theoretical fits to the data.  These fits were generated using the first principles calculated band structure, 
with the thermopower calculated via the Boltzmann transport code Boltztrap [13], using the constant 
scattering time approximation, which has shown considerable success in describing doped 
semiconductors.

The first fit (dashed line) was plotted using the first principles-calculated band gap of 30 meV for 
a chemical carrier concentration of n = 1.2 x 1019 cm-3, comparatively near the Hall data generated value 
(note that these two need not be exactly equal). This fit shows a low temperature thermopower slope S/T 
(T < 50K) approximately ten times the measured value, and then rapidly enters the bipolar regime soon 
thereafter.  Neither of these behaviors resembles the gently increasing curve in the experimental data (we 
suspect this data would show a maximum at T ~ 350 K). We have also tried fitting the data with a much 
heavier chemical doping (n = 1.5 x 1020 cm-3, not shown). While one can fit the initial slope of S(T) in 
this way, the thermopower magnitude at temperatures above 50 K continues to increase linearly, reaching 
magnitudes much larger than the experimental value. This is not surprising considering that EF (T=0) in 
this case is approximately 150 meV above the conduction band minimum, and nearly 180 meV above the 
valence band maximum, so that bipolar effects are minimal in this temperature range at this doping. The 
second curve (black solid line) was generated using the first principles calculated band structure with a 
“scissors shift” employed. In this “scissors shift” the conduction and valence band structures are taken as 
unchanged, but the band gap is adjusted. The plot indicates that band overlap of 0.003 Rydberg=41 meV 
(i.e. a -41 meV band gap) produces a good fit to the experimental data. We take this as strong evidence 
that Bi3O2S3 is in fact a semimetal, not a semiconductor. Note that we are also able to fit the data with a 
somewhat smaller band overlap of 27 meV, so we can say that the actual band overlap is most likely in 
the range of 27 – 41 meV. 
With the electronic structure established, let us consider the superconductivity itself in more 
detail. We note that superconductivity with Tc of ~ 5 K is rather unusual in a material with a carrier 
concentration of only 1.5 x 1019 cm-3, and is suggestive of strong electron-phonon interaction. Let us now 
make an approximate estimate of this interaction, using present and previous data. In Ref. [9] a value of 
the T-linear specific heat constant γ= 1.65 mJ/mol-K2 was reported.  On a density-of-states basis this is 
0.7/eV-formula unit, or 0.23/eV-BiS unit, noting that previous references [6] have argued the BiS2 layers 
to be the relevant component producing electron-phonon coupling, the presumed pairing source.  
Assuming a modified BCS expression Tc ~ωD exp(-(1+λ)/λ), including the Eliashberg mass 
renormalization and neglecting the Coulomb pseudopotential μ*, a 5 K Tc with the 188 K Debye 
temperature estimated in Ref. [9] corresponds to an electron-phonon coupling constant λ = NoV of 0.38. 
This yields a modified electron-phonon interaction potential V of 1.5 eV per BiS unit.  This rough 
calculation suggests a particularly strong interaction and one that could presumably be strengthened 
significantly via charge doping, if feasible, leading to larger Tc.   
We note that the same features suggestive of semimetallic behavior in Bi3O2S3 – the increasing 
thermal conductivity above the Debye temperature and likely saturation and turning-over of the 


6 
 
temperature dependent thermopower – appear to be present in the related material Bi4O4S3 [15]. In this 
case we cannot easily distinguish between a semimetal and narrow band gap semiconductor, but note that 
both cases are strongly at odds with the band structure calculations for this material published in Ref. 2, 
which depict a band edge some 0.6 eV above EF – i.e. metallic behavior. Hence the observance of 
semimetallic or narrow band gap behavior may be more common or general in this class of materials than 
previously thought. 
 
4 Conclusions 
In summary, we have synthesized and confirmed the bulk superconductivity by both resistivity 
and magnetic susceptibility measurements in the new BiS2-layer-based superconductor Bi3O2S3.. Hall 
results suggest that electronic charge carriers are dominant in normal state with the unusual low 
concentration of only 1.5 x 1019 cm-3, indicating the sample has particularly strong electron-phonon 
interaction, as also confirmed by DOS calculations. The thermopower data shows strong evidence of 
semi-metallicity for this new Bi-S-O system, and the band overlap is most likely in the range of 27 – 41 
meV.
