Electric transport and scanning tunneling spectrum (STS) have been investigated on polycrys-
talline samples of the new superconductor Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating behavior in the resistive
curve has been induced in the normal state when the superconductivity is suppressed by applying
a magnetic ﬁeld. Interestingly, a kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity near
4 K at all high magnetic ﬁelds above 1 T when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed.
This kink associated with the upper critical ﬁeld as well as the wide range of excess conductance
at low ﬁeld and high temperature are explained as the possible evidence of strong superconduct-
ing ﬂuctuation. From the tunneling spectra, a superconducting gap of about 3 meV is frequently
observed yielding a ratio of 2∆/kBTc ≈16.6. This value is much larger than the one predicted by
the BCS theory in the weak coupling regime (2∆/kBTc ≈3.53), which suggests the strong coupling
superconductivity in the present system. Furthermore, the gapped feature persists on the spectra
until 14 K in the STS measurement, which suggests a prominent ﬂuctuation region of supercon-
ductivity. Such superconducting ﬂuctuation can survive at very high magnetic ﬁelds, which are far
beyond the critical ﬁelds for bulk superconductivity as inferred both from electric transport and
tunneling measurements.

Superconductivity is induced by quantum condensa-
tion of a large number of paired electrons. The pairing
is supposed to be established between the two electrons
with opposite momentum and spins by exchanging the
phonons.
According to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer
(BCS) theory, a linear relationship between the electron
pairing gap ∆and superconducting (SC) critical tem-
perature Tc, i.e., 2∆/kBTc = 3.53 exists in the weak
coupling regime. In recent years, the original proposal
about the pairing based on the electron-phonon coupling
has been gradually replaced by the more exotic pairing
mechanism, such as through exchanging the magnetic
spin ﬂuctuations, and Tc can be increased to a higher
level. The SC pairing mechanism of the cuprates1 and
the iron pnictides2, although not yet being settled down
completely, should have a close relationship with strong
correlation eﬀect. In cuprates3 and pnictides4, the ratio
2∆/kBTc is generally much larger than that predicted
by the weak coupling BCS theory, implying the strong
coupling superconductivity (in some conventional BCS
superconductors, like Pb, Hg and PbBi, the coupling is
also strong5). Another important issue for cuprates is
that the electron correlation in the normal state may in-
duce strong superconducting ﬂuctuation which has been
widely investigated6–10. However, the ﬂuctuation region
in iron pnictides seems not that wide11,12. SC ﬂuctua-
tion was used to be associated with another characteris-
tic property, the so-called pseudogap eﬀect in cuprates13.
However the SC ﬂuctuation temperature was proved to
be diﬀerent from the pseudogap temperature by further
experiments14,15. Although pseudogap has a very close
relationship with superconductivity, there is however no
consensus yet on the origin of it in cuprates. The scan-
ning tunneling spectra show a continuous evolution from
the SC gap feature to the pseudogap feature which exists
at temperatures far above Tc16. High-Tc superconductiv-
ity should have a close relationship with the correlation
eﬀect of electrons from the 3d orbitals17–19. In the heavy
Fermion systems20 and organic materials21, a similar con-
clusion may be achieved. In this regard, it is natural to
explore new superconductors with possible higher transi-
tion temperatures in compounds with transition metal el-
ements in which the electron correlations could be strong.
The electrons in the p-orbital, especially those from the
5p or 6p orbits, are normally assumed to have weak re-
pulsive potential and quite wide band width, and hence
have very weak correlation eﬀect. It would be surprising
to ﬁnd out superconductivity with exotic feature in the
p-orbital based compounds.
Recently, Mizuguchi et al.22 discovered superconduc-
tivity with T onset
c
= 8.6 K (determined from the point
where resistivity deviates from the linear extrapolation
of normal-state value) and T zero
c
= 4.5 K in the so-called
BiS2 based compound Bi4O4S3. This compound has a
layered structure with the space group of I4/mmm or
I-42m. Shortly the same group reported superconductiv-
ity at about 10.6 K in another system LaO1−xFxBiS2 by
doping electrons into the material through substituting
oxygen with ﬂuorine23. By replacing the La with Nd or
Ce, other new BiS2 based materials were reported24,25.
Quickly followed is the theoretical work based on the ﬁrst
principles band structure calculations26, which predicts


2
that the dominating bands for the electron conduction
as well as for the superconductivity are derived from the
Bi 6px and 6py orbits. In this paper, we present a set of
data for an intensive study on the transport and scan-
ning tunnelling spectroscopy (STS) measurements of the
new superconductor Bi4O4S3. Our results clearly illus-
trate the strong coupling superconductivity and promi-
nent superconducting ﬂuctuation in this interesting su-
perconductor.
I.
EXPERIMENTS
The polycrystalline samples were synthesized by using
a two-step solid state reaction method. Firstly, the start-
ing materials bismuth powder (purity 99.5%, Alfa Ae-
sar) and sulfur powder (purity 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) were
mixed in a ratio of 2:3, ground and pressed into a pellet
shape. Then it was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube
and followed by annealing at 500 ◦C for 10 hours. The
resultant pellet was smashed and ground together with
the Bi2O3 powder (purity 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and sulfur
powder, in stoichiometry as the formula Bi4O4S3. Again
it was pressed into a pellet and sealed in an evacuated
quartz tube and burned at 510 ◦C for 10 hours. Then it
was cooled down slowly to room temperature. The sec-
ond step was repeated in achieving good homogeneity.
The resultant sample looks black and very hard. We cut
the sample and obtained a specimen with a rectangular
shape for the resistive measurements. The resistivity was
measured with Quantum Design instrument PPMS-16T.
The temperature stabilization was better than 0.1% and
the resolution of the voltmeter was better than 10 nV.
The magnetization was detected by the Quantum De-
sign instrument SQUID-VSM with a resolution of about
5 × 10−8 emu.
The sample was shaped as a bar with
a typical size of 2mm × 2mm × 0.5mm
for the STS
measurements. Since the sample is very hard, which al-
lows us to polish the sample surface and obtain a shiny
and mirror-like surface.
The top surface was polished
by sandpapers with diﬀerent grit sizes (smallest of ISO
P10000). The tunnelling spectra were measured with an
ultra-high vacuum, low temperature and high magnetic
ﬁeld scanning probe microscope USM-1300 (Unisoku Co.,
Ltd.). In STS measurements, Pt/Ir tips were used. The
set points of the bias voltage and tunneling current are
40 mV and 100 pA respectively to ﬁx the tip height in to-
pographic mode. Then the diﬀerential conductivity was
recorded while the bias voltage was swept with the tip
held at a ﬁxed vertical distance with z -piezo-feedback
oﬀfor the STS measurements. There is no atomically
resolved topography measured on the sample since it is a
polycrystalline one. The roughness of the surface for STS
measurements is about 2 nm, while on some ﬂat surface
of a grain the roughness is about 0.5 nm locally. The STS
spectra are repeatable at diﬀerent positions in one grain.
In reducing noise of the diﬀerential conductance spectra,

RESULTS
The crystallinity of the sample was checked by x-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) with the Brook Advanced D8 diﬀrac-
tometer with Cu Kα radiation.
The analysis of XRD
data was done by the softwares Powder-X and Topas.
The XRD pattern looks very similar to that reported by
Mizuguchi et al.22.
The result of Rietveld ﬁtting was
done with the Topas program in Fig. 1, yielding a 80%
volume of Bi4O4S3 with 20% of impurities which are
mainly Bi2S3(15%) and Bi(5%).
In Fig. 2(a) we present the temperature dependence of
resistivity measured at three magnetic ﬁelds: µ0H =0,
6 and 14 T. In addition to the moderate magnetoresis-
tance, one can see that a weak insulating behavior is
induced by the magnetic ﬁeld. This weak semiconduct-
ing behavior is of course anti-intuitive for a normal state
with Fermi liquid characteristic. A simple explanation
would be that the insulating feature is given by an ad-
jacent competing order here, once the superconductivity
is suppressed, the latter is getting promoted. However,
we should mention that the insulating behavior starts ac-
tually at 25 K (at 6 and 14 T) which is far beyond the
SC transition temperature here. Someone may argue the
minimum in the resistivity is caused by some impurities
of Bi2S3, which shows a minima around 25 K27, but this
may be excluded because we do not see this phenomenon
in zero magnetic ﬁeld.
Another possibility is that the
conduction band has a very shallow band edge, as il-
lustrated by the band structure calculations26. When a
magnetic ﬁeld is applied, the density of states (DOS) of
the spin-up and spin-down electrons will become asym-

metric given by the Zeeman eﬀect. Therefore we have
some polarized electrons which induce the weak insulat-
ing behavior. Clearly this insulating behavior needs to be
further checked, better with single crystals in the future,
and to be explained satisfactorily. In Fig. 2(b) we present
the magnetization data measured in the zero-ﬁeld-cooled
(ZFC) and the ﬁeld-cooled mode (FC). The SC magnetic
transition starts at about 3.6 K. Superconducting transi-
tion temperature in this paper is a little lower than that
in previous report by Mizuguchi et al.22, probably due
to mutual doping between the O and S elements. From
the resistive curve in the transition region as shown in
Fig. 3(a), the critical temperature taken from 5% of the
normal state resistivity (T zero

or Tirr) is 3.7 K. The on-
set transition temperature T onset

crossing point of the normal state line and the extrapo-

is about 6.2 K. It should be noted that the excess con-
ductivity region in which the resistivity starts to deviate
from the normal state line (inset of Fig. 3(a)) can extend
to the temperature above 10 K. This excess conductiv-

ference between the resistive curve and the normal state back-
ground extends to a very high temperature shown in the inset,
which suggests that the SC ﬂuctuation may be strong in this
material. (b) An enlarged view for the temperature depen-

increments of 1 T; and 9, 12, 14 T. It is found that the bulk
superconductivity can be quickly suppressed by the magnetic
ﬁeld, while the onset transition temperature changes slightly,
indicating a strong ﬂuctuation eﬀect. (c) Temperature depen-
dence of the resistivity (as shown in (b)) normalized at 10 K.
A kink can be clearly seen at about 4 K when the magnetic
ﬁeld is high and the bulk superconductivity is suppressed com-
pletely. The red arrowed line traces out the evolution from
the SC onset transition in the low ﬁeld region to a kink at
high magnetic ﬁelds.

ity is usually regarded as the SC ﬂuctuation from the
residual Cooper pairs above bulk Tc(99%ρn). This super-
conducting ﬂuctuation is actually expected by the band
structure calculations which foresee a low dimensional-
ity of the electronic structure, and can be corroborated
by the quickly broadened resistive transition under mag-
netic ﬁelds, as shown in Fig. 3(b). One can see that the
transition temperature with zero resistivity can be sup-
pressed blow 2 K by a magnetic ﬁeld as low as 0.4 T, while
the bulk superconductivity is suppressed completely by
a magnetic ﬁeld of 5 T. However, even if the bulk super-
conductivity is easily suppressed, a kink appears on the ρ
vs T curve at a high magnetic ﬁeld where one cannot see
the diamagnetization. If following the onset transition of
the resistivity, as shown in Fig. 3(c), we can see that the
kink has very close relationship with the upper critical
ﬁeld µ0Hc2 in the low ﬁeld and high temperature region.
Because it is really diﬃcult to deﬁne the temperature
below which ρn ﬁrst deviates from its high temperature
behavior, we use these kink positions to deﬁne the up-
per critical ﬁelds above 1 T. Surprisingly, this kink stays
at about 4 K even with a magnetic ﬁeld of 14 T. We
interpret this kink as the temperature below which the
residual Cooper pairs exist in the system even the bulk
superconductivity is completely suppressed.
Following
the tendency of this kink, a very high critical ﬁeld can be
expected in the zero temperature limit, which certainly
exceeds the Pauli limit given by µ0Hp = 1.84Tc28.
To make further analysis on the superconducting prop-
erty, we measured STS spectra on this sample. Several
typical STS curves measured at 1.6 K below the bulk
SC transition are shown in Fig. 4(a). Most of the spec-
tra are symmetric with very clear suppression of DOS
within a certain energy scale, and clear coherence peaks
can be found on some spectra. However the coherence
peaks on most of the curves are somewhat broad and the
zero-bias conductance values are remarkably large, which
maybe due to the contamination of the surface on this
polycrystalline sample. The gap values determined from
the coherence peaks or the kink position to the supercon-
ducting valleys (arrows in Fig. 4(a)) are mainly 3 meV for
most of the spectra, while some of the spectra show much
larger gap sizes or even two-gap features. In high-Tc su-
perconductors, sometimes a bosonic mode which exhibits
as a peak feature at a higher energy outside of the super-
conducting gap is found by STS measurements29,30. The
second gap in Bi4O4S3 resembles the bosonic mode fea-
ture. However such high-energy peaks are quite rare to
occur in hundreds of measured spectra, so we just regard
it as a possible second gap. In order to know the aver-
age value of the superconducting gap, we do the statistic
analysis to the gap size ∆taken from 400 spectra and
present in Fig. 4(b).
One can see that the mean gap
value ∆is about 3 meV. Considering the bulk supercon-
ducting transition temperature T onset
c
of 4.2 K, we get
the ratio 2∆/kBTc ∼16.6, which is almost 5 times of
the value given by the BCS theory in the weak coupling
regime. It is even higher than the values of most high-Tc

superconductors. This suggests the very strong coupling
superconductivity in the superconductor. Since the scat-
tering is really strong in the polycrystalline sample, it is
very diﬃcult to judge the pairing symmetry from the ﬁt-
ting to the spectra. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the gap size
can extend to a very large value, e.g., exceeding 10 meV.
Such inhomogeneity of SC gap sizes needs to be veriﬁed
by other experiment tools which may make it an inter-
esting new material.
In Fig. 5(a), we show the temperature evolution of the
STS spectra obtained by warming up the samples from
1.6 K through Tc to 20 K. One can see that the su-
perconducting feature marked by the depression of the
density of states near the Fermi energy persists at tem-
peratures above the bulk Tc(99%ρn) ∼6 K. Such a fea-
ture disappeared at temperature above some ﬂuctuation
temperature Tf = 14 K leaving only a V-shaped back-
ground.
If we use the spectrum measured at 20 K as
the background, we can obtain the normalized curves at
diﬀerent temperatures as shown in Fig. 5(b). Supercon-
ducting feature is weakened with the increasing of tem-
perature and evolve to a continuous background at the
temperature above Tf. In traditional superconductors,
the superconducting gapped features on tunnelling spec-
tra vanish at the temperature just above Tc.31 In contrast
such feature in cuprates could exist at the temperature
far beyond Tc, which has been regarded as the pseudo-

gap eﬀect16. Even in some iron pnictides, the gapped fea-
ture was observed to extend to a very high temperature32
and was explained by the presence of possible pseudogap
eﬀect33. The pseudogap eﬀect can also be observed from
the kink in resistive curve in cuprates13. Because we can-
not ﬁnd any trace of pseudogap from the transport mea-
surements, this eﬀect at high temperature is supposed to
be the SC ﬂuctuation instead of the pseudogap. In addi-
tion, the estimation is consistent with excess conductivity
at the temperature above bulk Tc. If using Tf = 14 K as
the pairing temperature, we get the ratio 2∆/kBTf ∼5.0
which is still a large value but comparable with the value
calculated from the SC gap and the pseudogap tempera-
ture in cuprates3. It should be noted that some SC gap
values could extend to very high, i.e., larger than 7 meV,
which gives a much larger value of 2∆/kBTf. The detailed
reason for this large energy gap remains unresolved.
Figure 6(a) shows the STS spectra taken at diﬀerent
magnetic ﬁelds at the same temperature 1.6 K. The bulk
upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2 judged from the 99% of the nor-
mal state resistance at 1.6 K is about 5 T. The suppres-
sion to the DOS on the spectra are apparently without
any variation when crossing this bulk transition temper-
ature, and it is more clear for the normalized spectra
by dividing out the background spectrum taken at 20 K
and 0 T as shown in Fig. 6(b). As described above, the

gapped feature on the spectra existing above Tc(99%ρn)
is consistent with the picture of ﬂuctuating supercon-
ductivity. Since the spectra at high magnetic ﬁelds are
similar to those taken at zero ﬁeld but at high temper-
atures, this suppression of DOS near Fermi energy ob-
served above bulk Hc(99%ρn) can also be attributed to
the SC ﬂuctuation and preformed Cooper pairs.

DISCUSSION
Next we present a phase diagram based on the trans-
port and STS measurements in Fig. 7 and give discussions
on the possible mechanism of superconductivity. The SC
transition point of critical ﬁeld Hc(99%ρn) is shown by
the red ﬁlled circles. The bulk superconductivity is es-
tablished in a very small area covered by the irreversibil-
ity line Tirr (blue up-triangles). The large area between
them indicates a strong SC phase ﬂuctuation. This is ac-
tually consistent with the theoretical expectation because
the electronic system has one dimensional feature(px and
py). The bulk superconductivity is established between
the one dimensional ﬂuctuating superconducting chains.

normal state background and the extrapolated line of
the steep resistive transition part.
The most puzzling
point is the kink appearing in the ρ vs. T data at a high
magnetic ﬁeld. The curve marked with Hkink
c2
shows the
critical ﬁeld determined from the kinky point of the resis-
tive data shown in Fig. 3(c), by following the trace of the
arrowed red line there. We add the ﬂuctuation temper-
ature Tf from the tunnelling spectrum at zero magnetic
ﬁeld to the phase diagram, and get a wide ﬂuctuation re-
gion at zero magnetic ﬁeld. Since this line traces very well
to the transition point marked by Hc(99%ρn) in the low
ﬁeld and high temperature region, we naturally attribute
it to the existence of residual Cooper pairs. If this kink
can be interpreted as the onset for the pairing, that would
indicate a very strong pairing strength or gap, which can
be inversely supported by the tunneling data. In a sim-
ple BCS picture, we have Hc2 = (πΦ0/2ℏ2v2
F)∆2, where
Φ0 is the ﬂux quanta, vF is the Fermi velocity. Such a
strong pairing needs certainly a reasonable cause, which
exceeds the limit of the simple phonon mediated pairing
picture. By taking account of the weak correlation eﬀect
in the Bi 6p electrons, some other novel mechanism, such
as the valence ﬂuctuation of the Bi2+ and Bi3+, may play
an important role in this new superconductor.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we perform the resistive and scanning
tunnelling spectroscopy measurements on the new BiS2
based superconductor Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating be-
havior is induced in the normal state when a high mag-
netic ﬁeld is applied. This can be induced either by an
adjacent competing order, or the very shallow px and py
band and small Fermi energy. A kink appears on the tem-
perature dependence of resistivity at all high magnetic
ﬁelds when the bulk superconductivity is completely sup-
pressed. This kink can be regarded as the presence of
local pairing, or the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(T). The SC
ﬂuctuation region from the STS measurement extends to
about 14 K although the bulk superconducting transition
temperature is only about 3.7 K. The gapped feature
near the Fermi energy can also extend to a high mag-
netic ﬁeld ( 5 T), which is consistent with the resistive
measurements, again indicating a strong superconduct-
ing ﬂuctuation.
From the tunnelling spectra, a mean
superconducting gap of 3 meV is widely observed, which
leads to a very high ratio of 2∆/kBTc ≈16.6, suggesting
strong coupling superconductivity.
We appreciate the useful discussions with WANG Fa,
FU Liang, WANG QiangHua and LI JianXin.
