Abstract. Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is a new BiS2-based superconductor system. In Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-
xSex, electron carriers are doped to the BiS2 layer by the substitution of Eu by La. Bulk 
superconductivity in this system is induced by increasing the in-plane chemical pressure, which 
is controlled by the Se concentration (x). In this study, we have analysed the crystal structure of 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex using synchrotron powder diffraction and the Rietveld refinement. The 
precise determination of the structural parameters and thermal factors suggest that the emergence 
of bulk superconductivity in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex is achieved by the enhanced in-plane chemical 
pressure and the decrease in in-plane disorder. 
1.  Introduction 
The BiS2-based superconductors have been drawing much attention as a new layered superconductor 
family [1-3]. The typical crystal structure is tetragonal (P4/nmm) and is composed of alternate stacks of 
the electrically conducting BiS2 layers and the insulating (blocking) layers, which resembles those of 
the Cu-based and the FeAs-based high transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [4,5]. The 
parent phase of the BiS2-based compounds is a semiconductor with a band gap [1,6,7]. Upon the 
generation of the electron carriers in the BiS2 layers, metallic conductivity is induced, and 
superconductivity is observed in the electron-doped compounds. With this scenario that the 
superconductivity can be induced by the electron carrier doping, many BiS2-based superconductors have 
been discovered [3]. Recent studies, however, have suggested that the emergence of superconductivity 
in BiS2-based compounds is related with not only the carrier doping but also the crystal structure 
optimization. For example, although the superconducting transitions are observed in LaO1-xFxBiS2 when 
electron carriers were doped by substitution of F for O, bulk superconductivity never appears while 
filamentary superconductivity with a small shielding volume fraction is observed. In addition, Tc in the 
filamentary superconducting phase is less than 3 K for optimally doped x = 0.5 [2]. The absence of bulk 
superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 would be caused by the long bond length of in-plane Bi-S, in which 
orbital overlaps between Bi and S are small. According to our recent report, the enhancement of in-plane

chemical pressure, which is related to the enhancement of orbital overlaps, are required to induce bulk 
superconductivity in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system [8]. 
Similar situation is observed in Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2, which has a lattice structure similar to the LaO1-
xFxBiS2 system [9]. Although the electron carriers are doped by the substitution of Eu by La, bulk 
superconductivity is not observed. Instead, superconductivity is induced by the external pressure effect. 
Tc is also enhanced to ~10 K by the application of external pressure [9]. The bulk superconductivity 
states of BiS2-based compounds can be induced by not only the external pressure effect but also the 
chemical pressure effect. We demonstrated the Se substitution for the Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2 system. 
Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex were synthesized up to x = 1, and the emergence of bulk 
superconductivity with a Tc of ~ 4 K for x ≥ 0.6 was confirmed by the electrical resistivity and magnetic 
susceptibility measurements [10]. From powder X-ray diffraction with the conventional laboratory X-
ray source (a CuK radiation) and the Rietveld refinements, we have suggested that the Se substitution 
resulted in the enhancement of the in-plane chemical pressure, and hence, the bulk superconductivity is 
induced. This result is consistent with previous studies on LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, 
in which the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure induced bulk superconductivity [8,11,12]. To 
confirm that the in-plane chemical pressure scenario is universal to the BiS2-based superconductors, 
precise analyses of the sample purity and crystal structure parameters of the newly discovered 
superconductor Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex are needed. In this study, we have performed synchrotron powder 
X-ray diffraction for Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. The evolution of crystal structure is analyzed by the Rietveld 
method. 
2.  Experimental details 
The polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex used in this study were prepared using a 
conventional solid-state-reaction method as described in Ref. 10. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
experiment was performed at the beam line BL02B2 of Spring-8 under a proposal No. 2016B1078. The 
synchrotron X-ray with an energy of 25 keV was used. Using the one-dimensional semiconductor 
detector (MYTHEN), diffraction data with a step of 0.006º were collected. All the experiments were 
performed at room temperature. The Rietveld refinements were performed using the RIETAN software 
[13]. For the in-plane Bi and chalcogen (Ch) sites, the Rietveld analyses were performed with the 
anisotropic thermal factors. The crystal structure image was drawn using the VESTA software [14]. 
3.  Results and discussion 
The X-ray diffraction patterns for x = 0–1 were refined using a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. For x = 
0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, fluoride impurities (BiF3 and LaF3) with populations of 4%, 4%, 5%, and 7% were 
found, respectively. For x = 0.8 and 1, small impurity peaks of the fluorides and unidentified broad peaks 
at 2 = 6.2º and 9.3º were observed. Although the broad impurity peaks would be selenides because of 
the appearance at higher nominal concentration of Se, we could not refine the impurity phase. Figure 1 
displays the typical synchrotron X-ray diffraction pattern and Rietveld refinement fitting result for x = 
0.6. Assuming the major phase (x = 0.6) and two fluoride impurities, the diffraction pattern is well fitted, 
and the resulting reliability factor (Rwp) is 8%. 
With the obtained structural parameters, we discuss the evolution of crystal structure of Se-substituted 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show the Se concentration dependences of lattice constant of 
a and c. The lattice constant of a monotonically increases with increasing x. In contrast, the lattice 
constant of c does not change for x = 0–0.6 and slightly increases at x ≥ 0.8. These results are consistent 
with the previous study performed with a laboratory X-ray diffractometer [10] and suggests that the Se 
is selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site (see the inset of Fig. 1 for the definition of the Ch1 and Ch2 
site). As experimental facts, we have not succeeded the refinement of Se occupancy at the Ch1 and the 
Ch2 sites because of the resulting negative small value of Se occupancy at the Ch2 site, which may be 
due to the fact that almost 100% Se goes to the in-plane Ch1 site. Therefore, we did the Rietveld 
refinements with the fixed Se occupancy as the nominal values x.

and LaF3) analysis method for Eu0.5La0.5FBiS1.4Se0.6 (x = 0.6). 
 
 
Figure 2(c) shows the Se concentration dependence of the Ch1-Bi-Ch1 bond angle. With increasing 
x, the bond angle decreases. Therefore, the flatness of the Bi-Ch1 plane becomes worse by Se 
substitution. This tendency is consistent with the structural evolution in the sister system 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S,Se)2 [11]. Figures 2(d)–2(f) show the in-plane Bi-Ch1 bond distance, Bi-Ch2 bond 
distance, and inter-plane Bi-Ch1 bond distance. The evolution of the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance seems to 
be correlating with the lattice constant of a. In contrast, the changes in the Bi-Ch2 distance and the inter-
plane Bi-Ch1 distance seem to be correlating with the lattice constant of c. These direct correlation 
between the local structure parameters and the lattice constant also suggest the selective occupancy of 
Se at the in-plane Ch1 site. 
As demonstrated in Refs. 8 and 10, the in-plane chemical pressure parameters (CP) were calculated 
using the obtained in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance and the ionic radii using the equation, CP = (RBi and RCh/(in-
plane Bi-Ch1 distance). RBi is the ionic radius of Bi2.5+, estimated in a previous structural analysis of a 
single crystal of La(O,F)BiS2 [15]. RCh (= 104.19 pm) is the average value of the ionic radius at the Ch1 
site, which is calculated using nominal x and ionic radii of S (184 pm) and Se (198 pm). With increasing 
Se concentration, the in-plane chemical pressure increases. Although the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance 
increases by Se substitution (Fig. 2(d)), the in-plane packing density increases by Se substitution, which 
results in the enhancement of orbital overlap between Bi and Se. As proposed in Refs. 8 and 10, we have 
confirmed that the enhancement of the in-plane chemical pressure is essential for the emergence of bulk 
superconductivity in this system as well.  
Finally, we discuss the evolution of the in-plane disorder by Se substitution. One of the advantages 
of synchrotron X-ray diffraction is the precise determination of the thermal factor, which can represent 
information about structural disorder. Since the superconductivity is induced in the Bi-Ch1 plane, we 
performed the Rietveld refinements with the anisotropic thermal factors for Bi and Ch1. Figure 2(h) 
shows the Se concentration dependences of the anisotropic thermal factor U11 for in-plane Bi and Ch1 
sites. U11 for Bi does not show a remarkable changes with increasing x. In contrast, U11 for Ch1 shows 


 
 
 
 
 
 
4 
 
a notable dependence on x. With increasing Se concentration, U11 for Ch1 decreases, which indicates 
that the in-plane disorder is suppressed by Se substitution. Generally in the BiS2-based compounds, the 
existence of huge in-plane disorders has been detected using several probes (neutron diffraction, X-ray 
diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy) [16-20]. We consider that the effect of the in-plane 
chemical pressure on the emergence of superconductivity in Se-substituted Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex would 
be the suppression of the in-plane disorder. This scenario is consistent with the results of extended X-
ray absorption fine structure studies on BiS2 compounds, in which the in-plane Bi-S1 bond intensity is 
enhanced by the in-plane chemical pressure effect generated by the small RE (rare earth ion) substitution 
in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 [8,20]. Therefore, with the present structural studies on the Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex system, 
we propose the relationship between the local in-plane disorder, the in-plane chemical pressure effect, 
and the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based superconductor family. To further confirm 
this scenario, structural studies with local scale and/or single crystal studies are needed.

4.  Summary 
In this study, we have performed synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction for the new BiS2-based 
superconductor system Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex, in which the bulk superconductivity was induced by Se 
substitution. The obtained structural parameters suggest four structural tendencies: (1) the selective 
occupancy of Se at the in-plane Ch1 site, (2) the direct correlation between Bi-Ch bond distances and 
the lattice constants, (3) the enhancement of the in-plane chemical pressure, and (4) the suppression of 
the in-plane disorder by Se substitution. These results will be useful for understanding the relationship 
between superconductivity and crystal structure in the BiCh2-based superconductor family.
