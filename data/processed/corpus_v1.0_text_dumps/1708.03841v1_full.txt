Abstract 
We have investigated the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 using neutron 
diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. From structural refinements, we found 
that the two metal sites, occupied by Bi and Pb, were differently surrounded by the sulfur 
atoms. Calculated bond valence sum suggested that one metal site was nearly trivalent 
and the other was nearly divalent. Neutron diffraction also revealed site selectivity of Bi 
and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. These results suggested that the crystal structure 
of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as alternate stacks of the rock-salt-type Pb-rich sulfide 
layers and the LaOBiS2-type Bi-rich layers. From band calculations for an ideal 
(LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer were hybridized with 
the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which resulted in the electronic 
characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2. Stacking the rock-salt type sulfide 
(chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2-based layered structure could be a new strategy to 
exploration of new BiS2-based layered compounds, exotic two-dimensional electronic 
states, or novel functionality.

Designing a new layered structure is one of the strategies for creating functional 
materials because low dimensional electronic states could be generated, and the 
electronic states could be easily tuned by altering stacking layer types. Among them, 
BiS2-based compounds, whose crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of an 
electrically conducting BiS2 bilayer and various kinds of insulating layers (blocking 
layers), have recently drawn much attention as superconductors [1-11] and 
thermoelectric materials [12-16]. As were the Cu-oxide and Fe-based high-transition-
temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [17,18], the superconducting properties and the 
thermoelectric performance of the BiS2-based compounds, such as RE(O,F)BiS2 (RE: rare 
earth), can be enhanced by replacing the elements at the blocking layer [19,20] and/or 
the conducting BiS2 layers [21-24], which modifies the electronic states and local crystal 
structure [25-30]. As the strategies for designing new BiS2-based compounds, 
explorations of new blocking layer structure or new types of conducting layers have been 
used, so far. Since the BiS2-based compounds have a layered structure with van-der-
Waals gap, making a stacking structure with ions or molecule layers, like intercalation, 
should be another strategy for creating new compounds with notable functions, as were 
FeSe-based, TNCl-based (T = Hf, Zr), and Bi2Se3 [31–35]. 
In this study, we have focused on a layered chalcogenide LaOBiPbS3, which was 
firstly reported by Sun et al. in 2014 [15]. According to the previous report, the 
conducting layer is composed of rock-salt-type M4S6 layers with M = Bi and Pb; the M 
sites are randomly occupied by Bi and Pb. However, we noted that the bond lengths of 
M1-S and M2-S are apparently different in LaOBiPbS3 (see Fig. 1 for the definitions of 
the M1 and M2 sites), which would indicate that the crystal structure of the M4S6 layer 
is not simple as described in Ref. 14. Therefore, we have analyzed the crystal structure 
of LaOBiPbS3 using neutron diffraction and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The 
structural refinements revealed site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. 
The Bi and Pb atoms preferably occupy the M1 and M2 sites, respectively. These results 
suggest that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as the alternate stacks 
of the rock-salt-type PbS-type layers and the LaOBiS2-type layers, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Insertion of rock-salt-type chalcogenide layers into the van-der-Waals gap of LaOBiS2 
could be a new strategy to exploration of new BiS2-based layered materials, exotic 
electronic states, or novel functionality. 
 
The LaOBiPbS3 polycrystalline samples were prepared by the solid-state reaction 
method. The La2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Bi2S3, and PbS (99.9%) powders were mixed, 


3 
 
pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 940 K for 25 hours. The 
obtained sample was ground, mixed to homogenize, pelletized, and heated at 1020 K for 
25 hours. The phase purity of the prepared pellets was examined using laboratory X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) with Cu-K radiation. Neutron diffraction experiment was performed 
at room temperature by using a time-of flight type super-high-resolution powder 
diffractometer (SuperHRPD) [36-38] of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex 
(J-PARC). The powder sample was installed into a Vanadium-Nickel Cell. We used the 
Z-Rietveld software [38] to perform Rietveld analysis. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
(SXRD) was performed at BL02B2 of SPring-8 with energy of 25 keV (project number: 
2016B0074). The synchrotron XRD experiments were performed with a sample rotator system at 
room temperature, and the diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional 
semiconductor detector MYTHEN with a step of 2 = 0.006º. The crystal structure parameters were 
refined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [39]. Schematic images of the crystal structure 
were drawn using VESTA [40]. 
 
Figure 2 displays the neutron diffraction pattern and the Rietveld refinement results 
for the LaOBiPbS3 sample. The obtained pattern could be refined using the structural 
model with the tetragonal P4/nmm space group (No. 129) with small impurities of 
La2O2S and PbS. The refined lattice constants were a = 4.09676(1) Å and c = 19.7996(6) 
Å. Assuming that concentrations of Bi and Pb in LaOBiPbS3 are the same, the refined 
occupancies of Bi for M1 and M2 were converged with 0.89 and 0.11, respectively: Bi:Pb 
= 89(2):11(2) for M1 and Bi:Pb = 11(3):89(3) for M2 are obtained. The final reliability 
factor Rwp was 5.16%. The refinement with the random model, in which M1 and M2 site 
was a fixed occupancy of Bi:Pb = 50:50, resulted in slightly higher reliability factor: Rwp 
= 5.19%. Indeed, the M1 site is selectively occupied by Bi, while the M2 site is selectively 
occupied by Pb in LaOBiPbS3.  
Figure 3 shows the SXRD pattern and the Rietveld refinement result for the 
LaOBiPbS3 sample. The obtained pattern was refined using a structural model with the 
tetragonal P4/nmm space group, as well. Impurity phases of La2O2S (11%) and PbS (7%) 
were detected. The refined lattice constants were a = 4.09717(4) Å and c = 19.7933(2) Å. 
The reliability factor Rwp was 7.5%. Note that the occupancies for M1 and M2 were fixed 
as the values obtained from neutron diffraction in the final Rietveld refinement of the 
SXRD pattern presented in Fig. 3. The refined lattice constants and atomic positions 
were close to those determined by neutron diffraction. The crystal structure parameters 
obtained from neutron diffraction and SXRD were listed in Tab. 1. In Tab. 2, the typical 
bond lengths and the bond angles around the M1 and M2 sites are listed. From the 


4 
 
refined bond lengths, we calculated bond valence sum for the M1 and M2 sites as 3.17 
and 2.19, respectively. These values of bond valence sum also suggest that the M1 and 
M2 sites are selectively occupied by Bi3+ and Pb2+, respectively, which is consistent with 
that obtained from neutron diffraction. 
To visualize the refined structure, the typical bond lengths and bond angles are 
displayed with a crystal structure image of LaOBiPbS3 in Fig. 4. The M1 site is 
surrounded by S1 and S2, forming Bi-rich M1S5 pyramids, in which M1 and S2 locate 
the bottom center and the apical position, respectively. The Bi-rich M1S5 pyramid 
structure is quite similar to that in LaOBiS2 [30]: shorter M1-S2 bonds and longer M1-
S1 bonds form the pyramid. The M2-S3 bonding forms rock-salt-like layers. As shown in 
Fig. 4, the in-plane M2-S3 bond length and the M2-S3 bond length along the c-axis 
direction are 2.8987 and 2.9443 Å, respectively. From the almost isotropic bonding in the 
M2-S3 layers, the structure can be regarded as a distorted rock-salt structure. In fact, 
the bond length of Pb-S in rock-salt-type PbS is 2.989 Å [41], which is close to the M2-S3 
lengths in LaOBiPbS3. From these structural characteristics, the structure of 
LaOBiPbS3 can be described as Bi-rich LaOM1S2 sandwiched by Pb-rich M2S layer. The 
in-plane (M1-S1) bond length in LaOBiPbS3 is slightly longer than the in-plane Bi-S1 
distance in LaOBiS2, which can be explained by the misfit between Bi-rich M1-S1 and 
Pb-rich M2-S2. 
On the basis of the refined crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3, we proposed that the 
crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 could be regarded as the alternate stacks of PbS-type 
(rock-salt-type) and LaOBiS2-type layers, as shown in Fig. 1. Insertion of rock-salt-type 
sulfide layers into the BiS2-type layered structures, should be a concept useful for 
designing new BiS2-based superconductors, thermoelectric materials, and functional 
materials. Since there are many kinds of BiS2-based compounds with various types of 
blocking layers, the material design concept presented here will expand the playground 
of chemistry and physics of BiS2-based functional materials. 
 
To understand the effects of the insertion of PbS-type layers into the LaOBiS2-type 
layers on the electronic states, we have calculated the band structure of the ideal 
LaOBiPbS3 structure with 100% occupancy (complete site selectivity) of Pb at the M2 
site, such as (LaOBiS2)(PbS). Figure 5 presents the first-principles band structure and 
the (partial) density of states calculated with the WIEN2k code [42] using the Perdew-
Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA-
PBE) [43]. We found that the S bands of the PbS layers are hybridized with the Bi bands 
of BiS plane around the Fermi energy. The band edge of the Pb bands and the S bands 


5 
 
of the BiS plane near the X point are located at around 1.2 eV above and 1 eV below the 
Fermi energy, respectively. The calculated electronic structure with density of states at 
Fermi energy looks quite different from LaOBiS2, although it is not decisive whether 
LaOBiPbS3 (with 100% occupancy of Pb at the M2 site) is metallic since the GGA-PBE 
approximation is known to underestimate the band gap. We expect, however, tunable 
band structure by the insertion of various kinds of chalcogenide layers, like PbS into the 
van-der-Waals gap of the BiS2-based compounds. Thus, stacking the rock-salt-type 
sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2-based layered structure should be a new 
strategy of band engineering for designing new BiS2-based layered superconductors, 
thermoelectric materials, or novel functional materials. 
 
In conclusion, the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 has been examined using 
neutron powder diffraction and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The structural 
refinements revealed that two metal sites, M1 and M2 sites, were differently surrounded 
by sulfur atoms. Furthermore, we found site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 
structure. The structural characteristics around the M1 and the M2 site are close to the 
Bi site of LaOBiS2 and the M2 site are close to the Pb site of rock-salt-type PbS, 
respectively. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be 
regarded as alternate stacks of the Pb-rich PbS-type layers and the Bi-rich LaOBiS2-type 
layers. From band calculations for an ideal (LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S 
bands of the PbS layer are hybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the 
Fermi energy, which results in the electronic characteristics different from that of 
LaOBiS2. Thus, stacking the rock-salt type sulfide (chalcogenide) layers and the BiS2-
based layered structure can largely modify the electronic structure and should be a new 
strategy of band engineering for designing new BiS2-based layered superconductors, 
thermoelectric materials, or novel functional materials.
