Abstract 
 
 Recently, new layered superconductors having a BiS2-type conduction layer have been 
discovered. NdO1-xFxBiS2 is a typical BiS2-based superconductor with a maximum Tc of 
5.4 K. In this study, the effect of element substitution within the superconducting layer 
of BiS2-based NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was investigated. We systematically synthesized two 
kinds of polycrystalline samples of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 and NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 by a 
two-step solid-state reaction method. The phase purity and the changes in lattice 
constants were investigated by x-ray diffraction. The superconducting properties were 
investigated by magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements. It was 
found that the partial substitution of S by Se resulted in the uniaxial lattice expansion 
along the a axis. The superconducting transition temperature were gradually degraded

with increasing Se concentration in NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. When Bi was partially 
substituted by Sb, the uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis was observed in 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2. In the Sb-substituted system, a metal-insulator transition was 
observed with increasing Sb concentration.

1. Introduction 
 
 Since the discovery of the novel layered superconductor Bi4O4S3, many studies for 
exploring new superconductors and clarifying the mechanisms of superconductivity in 
the BiS2 family have been carried out [1]. So far, three types of BiS2-based 
superconductors, Bi4O4S3 [1], REOBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) [2-9], SrFBiS2 
[10,11], have been discovered. The highest record of the transition temperature (Tc) is 11 
K in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 synthesized using a high-pressure technique. These BiS2-based 
superconductors basically have a layered structure composed of common BiS2 
superconducting layers and the blocking layers, which is quite similar to those of the 
cuprate and the Fe-based superconductors [13,14]. The superconducting properties of 
the BiS2 family can be tuned by changing the structure of blocking layer. To induce 
superconductivity in the BiS2-based layered materials, electron doping into the BiS2 
layers is required [15-20]. For example, in the LaOBiS2 system, superconductivity is 
induced by a partial substitution of O2- by F- or a partial substitution of La3+ by M4+ 
[2,21] at the blocking layers. Namely, the element substitution at the blocking layer is 
effective to induce/tune superconductivity in the BiS2-based family. Furthermore, it was 
reported that the superconducting properties are sensitive to the change in the local 
crystal structures [22]. For the REOBiS2 systems (RE = La, Ce and Pr), the optimal (the 
highest) superconducting properties are obtained by optimizing the crystal structures by 
using a high-pressure technique [2,4,6,23-27]. 
Although there are many reports on element substitution effects of blocking layers in 
REO1-xFxBiS2, the effect of element substitution at the superconducting layer has been 
reported in only one report. In Bi4O4S3, partial substitution of S by Se decreased its Tc 


4 
 
[28]. In this study, the effect of element substitution at the superconducting layers on 
superconductivity of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was investigated. We synthesized Se-substituted 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 
and 
Sb-substituted 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2. 
These 
element 
substitutions basically generate the changes in the lattice constants without any change 
in the carrier concentration. 
 
 
2. Experimental 
 
In this study, the F concentration was fixed to be x = 0.5 because the highest Tc was 
obtained 
for 
x 
= 
0.5 
in 
NdO1-xFxBiS2. 
The 
polycrystalline 
samples 
of 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 and NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 (x, y = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) were prepared by 
the 
two-step 
solid-state 
reaction 
method. 
The 
starting 
materials 
for 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 are Nd2O3 powders, Nd2S3 powders, NdF3 powders, Bi grains, 
BiSe2 powders and S grains. The starting materials for NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 are Nd2O3 
powders, Nd2S3 powders, NdF3 powders, Bi grains, Sb powders and S grains. The 
mixtures 
with 
the 
nominal 
compositions 
of 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 
and 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 were mixed-well, ground, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz 
tube and heated at 800 °C for 15 h. The obtained products were ground, pelletized, 
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and annealed at 800 °C for 15 h again. The obtained 
samples were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using the θ - 2θ method 
with a CuKα radiation. The lattice constants were calculated using the peak positions. 
The temperature dependence of magnetization was measured by a superconducting 
quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 5 Oe. The 


5 
 
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was measured by the four-probe 
method. 
 
 
3. Results 
 
 Figure 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of (a)NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 and 
(b)NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 (x, y = 0, 0.1 and 0.2). These XRD patterns were indexed using 
the P4/nmm space group. In the XRD patterns of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2, impurity peaks 
appeared in the doping range of y ≥ 0.1. In contrast, the impurity peaks were not 
detected upon Sb substitution in the XRD patterns of NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2. Almost all of 
the peaks became slightly broader in the substituted samples. The lattice constants a and 
c were calculated using the positions of the (200) peaks and the (004) peaks, 
respectively. 
 The Se-concentration dependences of the lattice constants of the a axis and c axis for 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. With increasing Se 
concentration, the lattice constant of the a axis increased while the lattice constants of 
the c axis did not change obviously in NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. The Se substitution for the 
S site resulted in a uniaxial lattice expansion along the a axis. 
 The Sb-concentration dependences of the lattice constants of the a axis and c axis for 
NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 is shown in Figs. 2(a) and (b), respectively. With increasing Sb 
concentration, the lattice constants of the a axis did not change obviously while the 
lattice constant of the c axis decreased in NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2. The Sb substitution for 
the Bi site resulted in a uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis.

 The temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility (χ) of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 
(x = 0, 0.1 and 0.2) are shown in Fig. 3. The inset shows the Se-concentration 
dependences of the Tc_onset and the Tc_10%. The Tc_10% is defined as a temperature where 
the value of χ becomes 10 % of χ(2 K).  The Tc_onset and Tc_10% decreased with 
increasing Se concentration. The shielding volume fraction of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 
also decreased drastically. On the basis of these results, we concluded that the Se 
substitution for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor degraded superconducting properties 
and finally destroyed the superconducting states. 
 For the NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 system, superconductivity was strongly suppressed by the 
Sb substitution. Even for y = 0.1, superconducting transition was not observed in the 
magnetic susceptibility measurements. Therefore, we performed electrical resistivity 
measurements to investigate the Sb substitution effect on the physical properties. Figure 
4 shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2. 
The resistivity drastically increased with increasing Sb concentration. When the Sb 
concentration was y = 0.1, the value of resistivity was 1.90×102 mΩcm at 6 K. When the 
Sb concentration was y = 0.2, resistivity was 1.35×105 mΩcm at 6 K. The value of 
resistivity for y = 0.2 was about 103 times larger than that of y = 0.1. The remarkable 
change suggests that the Sb substitution for the Bi site results in the metal-insulator 
transition in the NdO1-xFxBiS2 system. Having considered the one-dimensional character 
of the electronic states in the BiS2-based materials [15], we speculate that the observed 
metal-insulator transition would be related to the Anderson localization. To investigate 
further, detailed studies on transport properties and crystal structure using single crystals 
are needed.

4. Conclusions 
 
 The effect of the element substitution within the superconducting layer on 
superconductivity in the BiS2-based superconductor NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was investigated. 
The polycrystalline samples of NdO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 and NdO0.5F0.5Bi1-ySbyS2 (x, y = 0, 
0.1 and 0.2) were synthesized by the two-step solid state reaction method. When S was 
substituted by Se, the lattice constant of the a axis increased, and the superconducting 
properties (Tc and shielding volume fraction) were degraded. When Bi was substituted 
by Sb, the lattice constant of the c axis decreased, and a metal-insulator transition was 
observed. The element substitution within the superconducting layer degrades 
superconductivity in the NdO1-xFxBiS2 system.
