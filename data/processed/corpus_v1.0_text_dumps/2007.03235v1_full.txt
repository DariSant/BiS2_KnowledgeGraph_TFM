Abstract  
We have investigated the in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis magnetoresistance (MR) in 
both superconducting and normal states of single crystals of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 under in-plane 
magnetic fields. In the superconducting states of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, four-fold-symmetric in-plane 
anisotropy of the c-axis MR was observed below the superconducting transition temperature. 
Since the crystal structure of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is tetragonal, the rotational symmetry in the 
superconducting state is preserved in the present compound. This result is clearly different from 
the previous report observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals, where the in-plane MR in the 
superconducting state shows two-fold symmetry. On the other hand, in the normal states of 
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, two-fold symmetric MR with a small amplitude was observed. The possible origin 
of the two-fold-symmetric behavior was discussed with the presence of local structural disorder 
in the conducting plane of BiCh2-based compounds.

1. Introduction 
The BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductor family was discovered in 2012 [1–3] and has 
been extensively studied because the layered crystal structure resemble those of the cuprate and 
Fe-based high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [4,5]. The typical REOBiCh2 
(RE: Rare earth) system has a layered structure composed of the alternate stacks of REO 
insulating layers and BiCh2 conducting layers [2,3]. Fluorine substitutions for the oxygen site lead 
to electron carriers in the BiCh2 layers, which results in the emergence of superconductivity at 
low temperatures. The superconducting mechanisms in BiCh2-based superconductors have been 
extensively studied from both theoretical and experimental aspects. From theoretical studies, the 
possibilities of conventional s-wave, extended s-wave, d-wave, and g-wave states including weak 
topological superconductivity states have been investigated for BiCh2-based superconductors [6-
12]. Many experimental studies, such as thermal conductivity measurement, magnetic penetration 
depth, specific heat, and muon spin resonance (SR) propose conventional s-wave 
superconducting mechanism in BiCh2-based superconductor [13-15]. However, angle resolved 
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement indicated the presence of anisotropic 
superconducting gap in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 [17]. Also, the anomalous superconducting gap states 
have been reported by scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) for Nd(O,F)BiS2 [18]. In addition, 
the absence of isotope effect on Tc was confirmed in LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, Se)2 by using 76Se and 80Se 
isotopes [19]. These results suggest possibility of unconventional superconductivity in BiCh2-
based superconductors. Thus, the discussion about the mechanisms of superconductivity in 
BiCh2-based superconductors is still controversial. 
   
Recently, electronic nematicity has been a hot topic in the field of superconductivity. 
Electronic nematicity results in electronic states which break rotational symmetry of the crystal 
lattice. This electronic nematicity has been particularly studied in Fe-based superconductors [20, 
21]. Moreover, the nematicity in superconducting state (called nematic superconductivity) has 
been reported in the candidates of topological superconductor; typical examples are doped Bi2Se3 
[22-25]. In the nematic superconductivity, the rotational symmetry of superconducting gap 
amplitude breaks underlying symmetry of the crystal lattice. More recently, we have observed 
two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis magnetoresistance (MR) in the 
superconducting states of LaO1-xFxBiSSe single crystals (x = 0.1 and 0.5) [26,27]. Since the crystal 
structure is tetragonal (P4/nmm) with four-fold symmetry in the ab-plane, the observed two-fold-
symmetry in the superconducting states is resulting after breaking rotational symmetry of the 
crystal lattice. In addition, from a structural phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiSSe, we confirmed that 
a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic at low temperatures is completely suppressed 
by 4%-F substitution for the O site, i.e., x > 0.04 [28]. However, the universality of symmetry-
breaking MR in various type of BiCh2 superconducting family is still an open question, and thus 


3 
 
further investigation including different compositions would be helpful to clarify the overall 
features of MR symmetry in the superconducting states. In this study, we show that in-plane 
anisotropy of the c-axis MR for BiCh2-based superconductor NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystals in 
both superconducting and normal states. We found that four-fold symmetry of the c-axis MR in 
the superconducting states. This result is clearly different from those observed for LaO1-xFxBiSSe 
in which two-fold symmetry was observed in superconducting states [26,27]. 
 
 
2. Experimental details 
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystals were grown by a high-temperature flux method in an 
evacuated quartz tube [29]. Polycrystalline samples of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 were prepared by the solid-
state-reaction method using powders of Nd2S3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.999%), and BiF3 (99.9%) and 
grains of Bi (99.999%) and S (99.999%). A mixture of the starting materials with a nominal ratio 
of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 was mixed, pressed into a pellet, and annealed at 700 ºC for 15 h in an evacuated 
quartz tube. The obtained sample was grounded, mixed, pelletized, and heated at same 
temperature. The polycrystalline powder of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 (0.5 g) was mixed with CsCl/KCl flux 
(3.0 g), and the mixture was sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was heated at 800 ºC 
for 15 h and slowly cooled to 600 ºC with a rate of -1.0 ºC /h, followed by furnace cooling to 
room temperature. At room temperature, the quartz tube was opened under air atmosphere, and 
the product was filtered and washed with pure water. Single crystals were analyzed by scanning 
electron microscopy (SEM) TM3030 (Hitachi high-tech). As shown in Fig. 1(a), plate-like 
crystals were obtained. The plate surface with a square shape is corresponding to the ab-plane of 
tetragonal NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 [3,29]. The chemical composition of the obtained crystals was 
investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on the SEM. The average ratio of 
the constituent elements (except for O and F) was Nd : Bi : S = 1 : 1.0 : 2.1, which was normalized 
by the Nd value. The analyzed atomic ratio is almost consistent with the nominal composition. 
   
 The MR measurement was performed using a superconducting magnet at the high field 
laboratory of Institute for Materials Research (IMR), Tohoku University. To precisely control the 
magnetic field direction, a two-axes rotational probe was used. Figure 1(b) shows a schematic 
image of the terminal configuration, which was made using Au wires and Ag pastes, for the c-
axis resistivity measurements.  
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1(c) shows the temperature (T) dependence of the c-axis resistivity (c) of 
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The inset of Fig.1 (c) shows enlarged temperature dependence of the c (c-T) 


4 
 
around superconducting transition. The Tconset is 5.8 K, and Tczero is 5.2 K. A small upturn behavior 
on the c-T is observed at low temperature. Similar upturn behavior is observed for some layered 
superconductors having two-dimensional transport characteristics, such as cuprate and Fe-based 
superconductors [30,31].  
As shown in Fig. 2(a),  and  are defined.  is measured from the c-axis, and  is 
azimuth angle measured from the a-axis to the b-axis, while the a-axis and the b-axis are 
equivalent in a tetragonal crystal. Note that the charge current is always perpendicular to the 
magnetic field when the magnetic field is in the conducting plane since the c-axis resistivity was 
measured. Figure 2(b) shows the  angle dependence of the c-axis electrical resistivity at  = 180˚, 
B = 14 T, and T = 2.7 K. As shown in Fig. 2(b), B || ab, which was defined as the MR where the 
magnetic field is exactly parallel to the ab-plane, was estimated and used to investigate the in-
plane anisotropy.  
Figure 2(c) shows the  angle dependences of the B || ab at B = 14 T measured at 
temperatures from 10.0 to 2.5 K. Four-fold symmetry of the B || ab was observed in the 
superconducting states, which is trivial behavior because ab-plane of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystal 
has a tetragonal square Bi-S plane with four-fold symmetry. The result suggests that rotational 
symmetry in the crystal lattice is preserved when we see the in-plane anisotropy of the 
superconducting properties in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. Similar four-fold-symmetric in-plane MR in the 
superconducting states was observed for a crystal taken from a different batch (See supplementary 
information). This fact is clearly different from the two-fold symmetric MR observed in the 
superconducting states of LaO1-xFxBiSSe single crystals [26,27].  
Although we cannot conclude the origins of the switching between the two-fold-
symmetric and four-fold-symmetric superconducting properties in BiCh2-based superconductors 
so far, here we briefly discuss the possible origins of the different behaviors of the in-plane 
anisotropy for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 and LaO1-xFxBiSSe to encourage further theoretical and 
experimental studies on those systems. First, in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, two-fold-symmetric behavior was 
observed for x = 0.1 and 0.5. Since the carrier concentration and the Fermi surface topology could 
be different each other for those F concentrations, one can assume that the emergence of two-
fold-symmetric behavior is not affected by the carrier concentration. Then, we compare the 
constituent elements in the superconducting layer in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 and LaO1-xFxBiSSe. 
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 contains Bi-S superconducting planes, while LaO1-xFxBiSSe contains nearly Bi-
Se superconducting planes, according to the structural analysis of LaO1-xFxBiSSe [31]. The Se 
substitution for S at the superconducting plane should enhance spin-orbit interaction, and the spin-
orbit interaction is known as an important parameter to understand the electronic states and 
superconducting characteristics in the BiCh2-based systems [33-36]. The importance of spin-orbit 
interaction is also pointed out in the doped Bi2Se3 systems, which show nematic superconducting 


5 
 
behavior. Thus, the stronger spin-orbit interaction in the conducting plane of LaO1-xFxBiSSe might 
be crucial for the symmetry breaking MR in this compound. To conclude the origins for four-fold 
and two-fold-symmetric anisotropies of the MR in the superconducting states in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 
and LaO1-xFxBiSSe, further studies are desired. 
 
On the normal state properties, we observed two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of 
MR, as shown in Fig. 3(a). For comparison, the normal-state MR anisotropy for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe 
is shown in Fig. 3(b), in which four-fold symmetry is dominant. Note that the amplitude of those 
signals is very small as shown in Fig. 2(c). We consider that those anisotropy observed in the 
normal states is not directly linked to those in the superconducting states for both systems. 
Basically, the BiCh2-based compounds possess in-plane structural disorder due to the presence of 
Bi lone-pair electrons [37-40]. From extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies, in-plane 
local structures were explained using two different Bi-Ch bonds. However, the local disorder can 
be suppressed by chemical pressure effects [37,38], which is higher in a Bi-Se plane than in a Bi-
S plane [40]. Therefore, we expect disordered local structure in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 than LaO1-
xFxBiSSe. Although the samples used in the experiments are single crystals, such intrinsic local 
disorder (formation of local domains) would exist in both systems, and that should be more 
prominent in the transport properties of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 than LaO1-xFxBiSSe. 
 
4. Summary 
We have investigated the in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis MR in both superconducting 
and normal states of single crystals of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 under in-plane magnetic fields. In the 
superconducting states, four-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of MR was observed below the 
Tc. Since the crystal structure of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is tetragonal, the results suggest no symmetry 
breaking in the in-plane anisotropy of MR in the superconducting states. This is clearly different 
from those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals, in which two-fold-symmetric anisotropy 
of MR was observed in its superconducting states. We consider that the switching between two-
fold-symmetric and four-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR in the superconducting properties of 
those systems is related to the constituent elements at the superconducting planes, which is 
expected to modify the spin-orbit interactions. In the normal states of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, two-fold 
symmetric MR with a small amplitude was observed, while four-fold-symmetric anisotropy was 
observed in the normal states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. We consider that the normal-state in-plane 
anisotropy of MR in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is caused by local structural instability that is commonly 
observed in BiCh2-based compounds and tunable by chemical pressures.
