Abstract 
 High-quality polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were obtained using 
high-pressure synthesis technique. The LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample prepared by heating 
at 700 ºC under 2 GPa showed superconductivity with superconducting transition 
temperatures (Tc) of Tconset = 11.1 and Tczero = 8.5 K in the electrical resistivity 
measurements and Tconset = 11.5 and Tcirr = 9.4 K in the magnetic susceptibility 
measurements, which are obviously higher than those of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
polycrystalline samples obtained using conventional solid-state reaction. It was 
found that the high-Tc phase can be stabilized under high pressure and 
relatively-low annealing temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the 
high-Tc phase possessed a small ratio of lattice constants of a and c, c/a.

 The BiS2-based superconductors are novel layered superconductors [1,2]. The 
crystal structure is basically composed of an alternate stacking of double BiS2 
conduction layers and blocking layers such as RE2O2 (RE: Rare earth), Sr2F2 or 
Bi4O4(SO4)1-x layers[1-11]. Because of the layered structure similar to the cuprtes 
and the Fe-based family [12,13], appearance of novel mechanisms of 
superconductivity and high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) has been 
expected. Band calculations suggested that the parent material is a band insulator, 
and the BiS2-based materials could be superconductive when electron carriers were 
generated at the Bi-6p orbitals within the BiS2 conduction layers [14]. 
 LaO1-xFxBiS2 is a typical BiS2-based superconductor [2]. The parent phase LaOBiS2 
is semiconducting, and partial substitution of O by F generates electron carriers 
within the BiS2 layers. The superconducting transition temperature Tc of 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 becomes highest at x ~ 0.5. The Tc of the polycrystalline samples 
prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction (annealing in an evacuated quartz 
tube) is less than 3 K. However, the Tc can be largely enhanced up to 10 K by 
applying high pressure (HP) using a HP cell [15-17]. Recently, Tomita et al. showed 
the possibility of structural transition from tetragonal (low-Tc) to monoclinic 
(high-Tc) on the basis of the results of X-ray analysis under HP and the molecular 
dynamics simulations of density functional theory calculations. Another way to 
enhance the Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2 is HP annealing. The sample annealed at 600 ºC 
under 2 GPa showed Tconset = 10.6 and Tczero = 7.8 K [2,18]. The enhancement of Tc 
was explained by the uniaxial lattice strain along the c axis [19]. These scenarios of 
the appearance of high-Tc phase in LaO1-xFxBiS2 concluded in refs. 17 and 19 are 
basically consistent. However, to clarify the correlation between superconductivity 
and the crystal structure and to investigate physical properties of the high-Tc phase, 
the preparation of homogeneous samples with Tc higher than 10 K is much 
important. Here we report the HP synthesis of high-quality LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
polycrystalline samples with Tconset = 11.1 and Tczero = 8.5 K in the electrical 
resistivity measurements and Tconset = 11.5 and Tcirr = 9.4 K in the magnetic 
susceptibility measurements. 
 
 Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were prepared using a HP synthesis 
technique with a cubic-anvil-type 180 ton press. The starting materials are La2S3 
(99.9 %), Bi2O3 (99.99 %), BiF3 (99.9 %) and Bi2S3 powders and Bi (99.99 %) grains. 
The Bi2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Bi and S (99.99 %) grains. The mixture 
with a nominal composition of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 was well-mixed and pressed into a 


3 
 
pellet. The sample was sealed into a BN sample space and inserted into a HP cell. 
The HP cell was pressed with a pressure of 2 GPa and heated with various 
annealing temperatures and times. The detailed annealing conditions are listed in 
Table 1. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity below 300 K was 
measured using the four-terminal method. The DC magnetic susceptibility was 
measured 
using 
a 
superconducting 
quantum 
interference 
device 
(SQUID) 
magnetometer after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The Tconset in 
the susceptibility measurement was estimated to be a temperature where the 
susceptibility began to decrease. The error of the Tconset in the phase diagram (Fig. 4) 
was estimated by considering the real value of the susceptibility error at normal 
conducting states around 15 K. For Tcirr, the reliable estimation of error was quite 
difficult due to drastic change of susceptibility around Tcirr. Hence we did not plot in the 
phase diagram. The powder X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) experiments were carried 
out using a Rigaku SmartLab powder diffractometer equipped with a CuKα1 
monochrometer. To compare XRD patterns of various samples precisely, the standard Si 
powder was mixed with the samples, and used as the reference of the calibration of the 
peak shift. 
 
 The highest Tc and shielding property were obtained for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample 
prepared with heating at 700 ºC for 1 h under 2 GPa. The temperature dependence 
of electrical resistivity for the HP sample was displayed in Fig. 1(a). For comparison, 
resistivity data of the solid-state-reacted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline sample was 
plotted together. The Tc of the HP sample is obviously higher than that of the 
solid-state-reacted sample. The Tconset and Tczero are 11.1 and 8.5 K in the electrical 
resistivity measurement. The onset temperature was defined as a temperature 
where the resistivity began to decrease due to the evolution of the superconducting 
states as shown in Fig. 1(c). Figure 1(b) shows the temperature dependence of 
magnetic susceptibility for the HP and solid-state-reacted samples. In the 
susceptibility measurements, Tconset and Tcirr are 11.5 and 9.4 K, respectively. The 
Tcirr is a bifurcation temperature between the ZFC and FC curves as shown in Fig. 
1(d). 
 Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of the HP sample prepared with heating at 700 ºC 
for 1 h under 2 GPa (HP-700 ºC). The Miller indices are displayed over the 
corresponding peaks. The obtained XRD pattern shows an almost single phase, 
except for the tiny impurity phase of Bi2S3. By converting peak positions of the (200) 
and (003) reflections to the lattice constants a and c for the tetragonal unit cell, we 


4 
 
obtained a = 4.0748(1) Å and c = 13.2830(10) Å for the HP-700 ºC sample. As 
summarized in Table 1, the single-phase samples were obtained when the heating 
temperature was above 700 ºC. This fact indicates that the formation of the 
LaOBiS2-type structure requires a heating temperature higher than 650 ºC under a 
high pressure of 2 GPa. For the HP sample prepared at 800 ºC (HP-800 ºC), single 
phase was obtained by heating only for 0.5 h. However the Tc of the HP-800 ºC 
sample becomes lower than those of the HP-700 ºC sample.  
In Fig. 3, we plot XRD profiles around the (003) and (200) peaks for the 
solid-state-reacted sample, HP-700 ºC sample (the high-Tc phase) and HP-800 ºC 
sample (the low-Tc phase), respectively. As in the case of the HP-700 ºC sample, the 
lattice constants of the HP-800 ºC sample are obtained as a = 4.0727(1) Å and c = 
13.2920(10) Å. The lattice constants of the solid-state-reacted sample are a = 
4.0709(1) Å and c = 13.3475(3) Å. One can see the broadening of the peaks when the 
Tc of the sample is increased. Moreover, the peak positions of the (003) and (200) 
reflections monotonically increases and decreases, respectively. Therefore, we think 
that there is a close correlation between the lattice parameters and the appearance 
of the high-Tc phase in the BiS2-based superconductor. We discuss its detail below. 
Firstly, we compare the solid-state-reacted sample and the HP-700 ºC sample. The 
position of the (003) peak for the HP-700 ºC sample is higher than that of the 
solid-state-reacted sample. This indicates that the length of the c axis for the 
HP-700 ºC sample is clearly shorter than that of the solid-state-reacted sample. In 
contrast, peak position of the (200) peak for the HP-700 ºC sample is lower than that 
of the solid-state-reacted sample. This indicates that the length of the a axis in the 
HP-700 ºC sample is longer than that of the solid-state-reacted sample. Namely, a 
small c/a ration is important for the appearance of the high-Tc phase. These 
tendencies are basically consistent with the uniaxial contraction along the c axis 
observed in the HP-post-annealing studies [2,18,19]. Although the previous X-ray 
studies for the solid-state-reacted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample under HP suggested that 
the monoclinic phase appeared under HP, we did not observe a clear evidence of the 
structural phase transition to the monoclinic structure in the present studies on the 
HP-synthesized samples. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the (003) and (200) 
peaks are broader than those of the solid-state-reacted sample, implying a little but 
finite lattice distortion into the HP-700 ºC sample. Therefore, we speculate that the 
high-Tc phase of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 requires an intermediate lattice structure 
between tetragonal and monoclinic structure.

 Next, we discuss the differences in the superconducting properties and crystal 
structure between the HP-700 ºC sample and HP-800 ºC sample. As shown in Fig. 1, 
the Tc of the HP-700 ºC sample is the highest, Tconset = 11.5 K and Tcirr = 9.4 K, and 
the shielding volume fraction estimated using a value of ZFC magnetization at 2 K 
is almost 100 %. In contrast, the HP-800 ºC sample does not show bulk 
superconductivity; the estimated Tc are Tconset = 8.6 K and Tcirr = 4.1 K and the 
shielding volume fraction calculated using a value of ZFC magnetization at 2 K is 
~3.5 %. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the position of the (003) peak for the HP-800 ºC 
sample is slightly lower than that of the HP-700 ºC sample. In contrast, the position 
of the (200) peak is higher than that of the HP-700 ºC sample as shown in Fig. 3(b). 
This means that the HP-800 ºC sample possesses a shorter a axis and a longer c axis 
than those of the HP-700 ºC sample. To visualize the relationship between Tc and 
the c/a ratio, the data for the solid-state-reacted, the HP-700 ºC and the HP-800 ºC 
samples are plotted in Fig. 4. It is clear that the appearance of higher-Tc 
superconductivity requires the smaller c/a ratio. Furthermore, the peaks of the 
HP-800 ºC sample are sharper than those of the HP-700 ºC sample. Thus, the 
HP-800 ºC sample could be considered as almost a normal tetragonal phase. On the 
basis of these facts, we consider that the smaller c/a ratio and/or lattice strain 
toward a lower-symmetry structure such as monoclinic are essential for the 
appearance of higher-Tc superconductivity in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor. As 
an important fact, the high-Tc phase of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor can be 
obtained under the environment of high pressure and low reacting temperature. To 
analyze the local structure in detail, growth of the single crystal of the high-Tc 
phase is required. 
 
 In conclusion, high-quality polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were obtained 
using high-pressure synthesis technique. The LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample prepared by 
heating at 700 ºC for 1 h under 2 GPa showed the highest Tc and shielding volume 
fraction. The estimated transition temperatures were Tconset = 11.1 and Tczero = 8.5 K 
in the electrical resistivity measurements and Tconset = 11.5 and Tcirr = 9.4 K in the 
magnetic susceptibility measurements. These values are higher than those of the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples obtained from a conventional solid-state 
reaction. It was found that the high-Tc phase can be stabilized under high pressure 
and relatively-low heating temperature. XRD experiments indicated that to realize 
the high-Tc phase in BiS2-based superconductor, the smallest value of the c/a ratio of 
the lattice constants is essential. Since the superconducting properties of the 


6 
 
HP-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample is better than those of the solid-state-reacted 
samples 
and 
the 
HP-post-annealed 
samples, 
detailed 
investigations 
of 
superconducting properties using the HP sample will provide us with important 
information for elucidating the mechanisms of BiS2-based superconductivity.
