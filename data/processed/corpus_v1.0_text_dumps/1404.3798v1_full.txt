Abstract 
 
 Superconducting properties under high magnetic fields for the novel BiS2-based layered 
superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (polycrystalline sample prepared using the high-pressure 
synthesis method) have been investigated. The anisotropy of the upper critical field was 
discussed by analyzing the temperature dependence of the temperature derivative of resistivity. 
The temperature dependence of upper critical field showed an anomalous behavior with a 
characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We revealed that the anomalous behavior was caused by 
the existence of three kinds of upper critical field, 0HC2
max, 0HC2
mid and 0HC2
min in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field 0HC2
min is regarded as the 0Hc2 where the 
superconducting states of the grains with an orientation of H // c are suppressed. The 0HC2
max 
and 0HC2
mid are regarded as the 0Hc2 where the superconducting states of the grains with an 
orientation of H // ab are suppressed. The difference between the 0HC2
max and 0HC2
mid could be 
explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S plane. The estimated 
anisotropy parameter of the upper critical fields was about 7.4 for the high-pressure-synthesized 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline sample. Since the value was clearly lower than the anisotropy 
parameter of over 30 observed in the previous report on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystals grown 
under ambient pressure, we concluded that a larger anisotropy of superconductivity was not 
essential for the enhancement of Tc, and lower anisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in 
LaO1-xFxBiS2.

1. Introduction 
 
 Layered superconductors have drawn many research attentions because of the appearance of 
unconventional superconductivity and a high transition temperature (Tc). So far, two kinds of 
high-Tc layered superconductors, cuprates and Fe-based superconductors, have been discovered 
[1,2]. Both the high-Tc superconductors possess a crystal structure composed of an alternate 
stacking of common superconducting layers and spacer layers. Recently, we have discovered 
novel layered superconductors with the BiS2 superconducting layers [3,4]. This family possesses 
a crystal structure composed of an alternate stacking of the common BiS2 superconducting 
layers and the various spacer layers such as RE2O2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Yb) [4-11], Sr2F2 
[12,13] and Bi4O4(SO4)1-x layers [3]. Their crystal structure at room temperature and under 
ambient pressure is categorized into the tetragonal space group of P4/nmm. Basically, a parent 
phase of the BiS2 family is a semiconductor with a band gap. The BiS2-based materials become 
metallic with electron doping into the BiS2 layers and then exhibit superconductivity at low 
temperatures. In the superconducting phases, two Bi-6p orbitals of 6px and 6py are essential for 
the evolution of superconducting states [14-20]. 
 So far, the highest Tc in the BiS2-based family is Tc
onset ~ 11 K of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The 
superconducting properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are highly sensitive to application of pressure. 
Although as-grown LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 prepared by solid-state reaction shows a superconducting 
transition with Tc ~ 3 K [2], the Tc can be enhanced to over 10 K by applying high pressure 
[21-23]. The higher-Tc phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be obtained by annealing the as-grown 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample under high pressure of 2 GPa. Namely, the higher-Tc (high-pressure) 
structure could be memorized even after the sample is put at ambient pressure after the 
high-pressure annealing [2,23]. One-step high-pressure synthesis can also provide a higher-Tc 
phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under the optimal synthesis condition of 2 GPa and 700 ºC [24]. Crystal 
structure analysis revealed that the higher-Tc phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be induced by uniaxial 
lattice contraction along the c axis [25]. Furthermore, Tomita et al. reported that the lattice 
contraction under high pressure could be explained by a structural transition from tetragonal to 
monoclinic on the basis of analysis of the x-ray diffraction patterns under high pressure and 
optimization of the atomic positions by using density functional theory calculations [23]. In this 
article, we show a largely anisotropic magnetic field-temperature (H-T) phase diagram of 
superconductivity in the higher-Tc phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
 
2. Experimental details 
 A polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 was prepared using high-pressure synthesis with a 
cubic-anvil-type 180 ton press. The starting materials are the La2S3 (99.9 %), Bi2O3 (99.99 %), 


3 
 
BiF3 (99.9 %) and Bi2S3 powders and the Bi (99.99 %) grains. The Bi2S3 powder was prepared 
by reacting the Bi and S (99.99 %) grains. The mixture with a nominal composition of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 was well-mixed and pressed into a pellet. The sample was sealed into a BN 
crucible and inserted into a high-pressure cell composed of a carbon heater, pyrophyllite cube 
and electrodes. The high-pressure cell was pressed with a pressure of 2 GPa and heated at 700 
ºC for 1 hour. The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (-T) was measured using 
a four-terminal method under magnetic fields up to 14 T. The magnetic field dependence of the 
electrical resistivity (-H) in pulsed magnetic fields of up to ~ 56 T was measured by utilizing a 
non-destructive pulsed magnet using the four-terminal method. The duration of the pulsed 
magnetic field was about 36 msec. In the electrical resistivity measurements, the direction of 
current was parallel to the applied magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of the magnetic 
susceptibility after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) was measured using a 
superconducting interference devise (SQUID) magnetometer with applied magnetic field up to 3 
T. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
 Figure 1(a) shows the temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
under a field of 0.5 mT. Below 11 K, diamagnetic signals corresponding to the evolution of 
superconducting states are observed. The irreversible temperature (Tc
irr), which is a bifurcation 
point between the ZFC and FC curves, is 8.5 K. Figure 1(b) displays the temperature 
dependence of the FC susceptibility for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 with applied fields of 0.5 mT, 0.5 T and 1 
T. It is found that the superconducting states can be destroyed by applying a relatively small 
field of 1 T. At the same time, we clearly note that the onset of Tc is robust against the 
application of high magnetic fields. 
 Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under 
magnetic fields up to 14 T. The Tc
onset and Tc
zero under 0 T are 10.8 K and 7.7 K, respectively. 
Here, we define the Tc
onset as a temperature where resistivity begins to decrease in the -T 
measurements. Figure 2(b) shows the enlargement of the temperature dependence of the 
resistivity near the Tc
onset. With increasing magnetic field, the Tc
zero is largely suppressed, and the 
zero-resistivity state is not observed above 3 T within a temperature range of T > 2 K. In 
contrast, the kink observed at Tc
onset under 0 T is robust against the application of high magnetic 
fields and still observable at 14 T. As will be discussed later, the (T) curves above 6 T show 
additional anomaly (see Fig. 2(b)). To obtain further information under higher magnetic fields, 
we performed the -H measurements in pulsed magnetic fields up to 56 T. Figure 3 shows the 
field dependence of the electrical resistivity at 1.4 K, 2.4 K, 3.4 K and 4.2 K. The onset point 
(0Hc2 (pulse)) of the superconducting transition is estimated using a criterion of 99 % of the 


4 
 
normal state resistivity. Above 0Hc2, the resistivity is almost constant as a function of fields. 
The 0Hc2 is estimated to be 18.7 T, 15.4 T, 12.7 T and 10.7 T for 1.4 K, 2.4 K, 3.4 K and 4.2 K, 
respectively. 
 To analyze the obtained data of the resistivity under various magnetic fields, we plotted the 
0Hc2 and 0Hirr estimated using the Tc
onset and Tc
zero in the -T measurements in Fig. 4. The 
0Hc2 estimated from the -H measurements with pulsed magnetic fields is also plotted in Fig. 4. 
The 0Hc2 (pulse) agrees with the Hc2 (-T). It is found that the 0Hirr is much lower than the 
0Hc2. This can be understood by the large anisotropy of superconductivity in the BiS2-based 
superconductors. Recently, Nagao et al. reported that the anisotropy of superconductivity in 
REO1-xFxBiS2 was quite large and was relevant to those of cuprate superconductors [27,28]. The 
sample used in this study is polycrystalline; hence, the grain orientation should be random. 
Generally in the layered superconductors with large anisotropy of superconductivity, the 
superconducting states in the grains whose c axis is parallel to the applied magnetic fields are 
strongly suppressed with applying high magnetic fields. It is conceivable that the large 
suppression of the fraction of the FC susceptibility at high magnetic fields is caused by the large 
anisotropy of superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. In other words, the superconducting states for 
some grains are suppressed by applying magnetic fields. 
 As shown in Fig. 4, the temperature dependence of the 0Hc2 shows an anomalous curve with a 
characteristic field of ~ 8 T. To clarify the anomalous behavior of the 0Hc2, we analyzed the 
anisotropy of the 0Hc2 using the method proposed by Bud’ko et al. [29]. They showed that the 
anisotropy of the 0Hc2 for the randomly oriented powder samples of layered superconductors 
can be estimated by analyzing the temperature dependence of the temperature derivative of 
magnetization (dM/dT). In the method, the maximum upper critical field 0Hc2
max, which could 
be regarded as the Hc2 for the grains with a grain orientation of H//ab, can be estimated from the 
onset of dM/dT; we call the onset temperature Tmax. The minimum upper critical field Hc2
min, 
which can be regarded as the 0Hc2 for the grains with H//c can be estimated from the kink in 
the dM/dT-T curve; we call this temperature Tmin. 
 The temperature dependence of the dM/dT for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under various magnetic fields of 
0.5 T, 1 T, 2 T and 3 T is shown in Fig. 5(a-d), respectively. As represented in Fig. 5(b), we 
clearly observe the Tmax and Tmin as observed in the MgB2 and LuNi2B2C superconductors [29]. 
However, the signal to noise ratio (S/N) becomes smaller at high magnetic fields due to the 
large suppression of bulk characteristics of superconductivity. Therefore, we discuss the 
0Hc2
max and 0Hc2
min by analyzing the temperature derivative of the electrical resistivity to 
clarify the anomalous behavior of the 0Hc2-T curve under high magnetic fields. As shown in 
Fig. 5(a-d), it was confirmed that the Tmax and Tmin estimated using the dM/dT-T curve almost 
correspond to those estimated using the d/dT-T curve under all magnetic fields up to 3 T. 


5 
 
Furthermore, the S/N ratio of the d/dT-T curve is clearly better than that of the dM/dT-T curve. 
Therefore, we here investigate the anisotropy of the 0Hc2 by analyzing the d/dT-T data. 
 As shown in Fig. 5(a-d), both the Tmax and Tmin shift to lower temperatures with increasing 
magnetic field. In particular, the Tmin is rapidly suppressed with increasing field and becomes 
below 2 K above 4 T. Therefore, the 0Hc2
min(0 K) is expected to be less than 5 T. At above 5 T, 
we observed an additional inflection point in the d/dT-T curves. Figure 6(a) shows the d/dT-T 
and -T curves for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under a magnetic field of 8 T. The onset point, Tmax, is still 
above 9 K. The Tc
onset (-T) is corresponding to the temperature where the value of the d/dT 
equals to zero. The inflection point appears at ~5.3 K; here, we call this characteristic 
temperature Tmid. Below the Tmid, the value of the d/dT begins to increase rapidly. At the same 
time, the resistivity begins to decrease largely, which indicates the evolution of the 
superconducting current path below the Tmid. Figure 6(b) displays the enlargement of 
temperature dependence of the resistivity under various magnetic fields up to 14 T. The Tmid 
estimated from the d/dT-T curves using the method same as in Fig. 6(a) is indicated by arrows 
in Fig. 6(b). With increasing magnetic fields, the anomaly at Tmid in the -T curve is more 
pronounced. Then, the Tmid overlaps with the Tc
onset under magnetic fields above 10 T. It can be 
considered that the Tc
onset, which denotes the evolution of superconducting current path, 
corresponds to the Tmax under lower magnetic fields while it corresponds to the Tmid under 
higher magnetic fields. Hence, the anomalous behavior of the 0Hc2-T curve was observed in 
Fig. 4. 
 In Fig. 7(a), we plotted the 0Hc2
max(T), 0Hc2
mid(T) and 0Hc2
min(T) with the data points of the 
0Hc2 (-T), 0Hirr (-T) and 0Hc2 (pulse). The 0Hc2
min(T) is obviously lower than the 0Hc2
max 
and 0Hc2
mid at whole temperatures, and it is located near Hirr(T). As mentioned above, the low 
0Hc2
min can be understood by the large anisotropy of superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Namely, the superconducting current path can be easily destroyed under magnetic fields for the 
grains with a grain orientation of H // c. Next, we discuss the difference between the 0Hc2
max 
and 0Hc2
mid. As shown in Fig. 7(a), the curve of temperature dependence of the 0Hc2 (-T) 
almost overlaps with the 0Hc2
max(T) curve under magnetic fields up to 5 T. Then, it deviates 
from the 0Hc2
max(T) curve. Interestingly, the curve of the temperature dependence of the 0Hc2 
(-T) finally overlaps with the 0Hc2
mid(T) curve under magnetic fields at above 10 T. The 
observed anomalous behavior of the 0Hc2-T curve implies that the superconducting current path 
is generated below Tmax under lower magnetic fields while it is generated below Tmid under 
higher magnetic fields. Therefore, there should be a factor, which affects upper critical field, 
except for the difference in the grain orientation between H//ab and H//c. 
 To explain the difference of two kinds of upper critical field, 0Hc2
max and 0Hc2
mid, we assume 
that the superconducting states within the ab plane are anisotropic. The structure distortion (or 


6 
 
strain) could exist in the present sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 prepared using the high-pressure 
synthesis technique, as observed in the previous high-pressure studies on superconductivity and 
crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [23]. Although the evidence of lowering of symmetry of the 
crystal structure was not detected in the x-ray diffraction measurements, the broadening of the 
(h00) and (00l) peaks was observed in the high-pressure LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples [25,26]. 
Therefore, it is conceivable that the crystal structure of the present LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
polycrystalline sample is not a perfect tetragonal structure. If the ab plane is distorted (or 
strained), the superconducting states along the a axis could be non-equivalent to that along the b 
axis. In that case, the upper critical field for the a-axis direction and the b-axis direction could 
be different due to the difference of effective mass. In addition, a previous theoretical study 
suggested that the one-dimensional nature of the Bi bands (Bi-6px and Bi-6py) provides good 
nesting of the Fermi surface in the LaO1-xFxBiS2 system [14]. Furthermore, Suzuki et al. showed 
that the band structure of the BiS2 family could be largely affected by the change in the local 
crystal structures [15]. These theoretical studies could suggest a possibility of the appearance of 
the anisotropic superconducting states within the ab plane when the degeneracy of Bi-6px and 
Bi-6py is lifted. Therefore, it is conceivable that there are the different upper critical fields of 
0HC2
a-axis and 0HC2
b-axis in a distorted (or strained) Bi-S plane of LaO0.5F0.5BiS. On the basis of 
the discussion, the evolution of the anisotropic superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under 
magnetic fields is summarized as below. All the grains are superconducting at 0H < 0HC2
min. 
At magnetic fields of 0HC2
min < 0H < 0HC2
mid, superconducting states of the grains with a 
grain orientation of H // c are suppressed. Then, under 0HC2
mid < 0H < 0HC2
max, the 
superconducting states of the grains with an orientation of H // a or H // b are suppressed; we 
cannot distinguish the a-axis orientation from the b-axis orientation within the results of present 
study. Above 0HC2
max, all the grains become non-superconducting. 
 To discuss the anisotropy of upper critical field, we have plotted the values of the 0HC2
max(T), 
0HC2
mid(T) and 0HC2
min(T) in Fig. 7(b). The data points for the 0HC2
mid and 0HC2 (pulse) 
exhibit a linear temperature dependence. Therefore, we estimated the d0HC2
max/dT, 
d0HC2
mid/dT and d0HC2
min/dT by fitting the data points with a linear function of temperature to 
discuss the anisotropy. The estimated d0HC2
max/dT, d0HC2
mid/dT and d0HC2
min/dT are -7.05 
(T/K), -2.60 (T/K) and -0.95 (T/K), respectively. The anisotropy parameter estimated using the 
values of the d0HC2
max/dT and d0HC2
min/dT is 7.4. The anisotropy parameter estimated in this 
work are clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over 30 for LaO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals 
(Tc ~ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure [28]. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of 
superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of the Tc, and the lower anisotropy may 
be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Furthermore, the evolution of the in-plane 
anisotropy within Bi-S plane may play an important role for the enhancement of Tc. To elucidate 


7 
 
the mechanism of superconductivity in the BiS2 family, high-field studies using LaO1-xFxBiS2 
single crystals with higher Tc are needed. To achieve it, single crystal growth of the high-Tc 
phase of LaO1-xFxBiS2 is required. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 We have studied magnetic and transport properties of the high-pressure-synthesized 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 poly crystalline sample under high magnetic fields. The temperature dependence 
of upper critical field shows anomalous behavior with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We 
found that the anisotropy of upper critical field of the polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
can be estimated by analyzing the characteristic temperatures in the d/dT-T curve. It was found 
that there were three kinds of upper critical field in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical 
field 0HC2
min is regarded as the 0Hc2 when the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the c axis 
of the grain. The 0HC2
max and 0HC2
mid are regarded as the 0Hc2 where the superconducting 
states are suppressed for the grains with an orientation of H // ab. The difference between the 
0HC2
max and 0HC2
mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the 
Bi-S plane, which is possibly caused by the lattice distortion or strain within the Bi-S plane. 
Hence, the upper critical fields 0HC2
 a-axis and 0HC2
b-axis are different due to the difference of 
effective mass. The fraction of the grains in superconducting states decreases with increasing 
magnetic field in the order of 0 T, 0HC2
min, 0HC2
mid and 0HC2
max. Above 0HC2
max, all the 
grains become non-superconducting. The estimated d0HC2
max/dT, d0HC2
mid/dT and 
d0HC2
min/dT are -7.05 (T/K), -2.60 (T/K) and -0.95 (T/K), respectively. The anisotropy 
parameter for upper critical field estimated using d0HC2
max/dT and d0HC2
min/dT is 7.4, which is 
clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over 30 in the previous report for LaO1-xFxBiS2 
single crystals (Tc ~ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of 
superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and the lower anisotropy might be 
important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Moreover, the evolution of the in-plane anisotropy 
within the Bi-S plane may play an important role for the enhancement of Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.
