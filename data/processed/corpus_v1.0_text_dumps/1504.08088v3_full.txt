Abstract  
We have investigated the effect of La doping and high pressure on superconducting properties of EuBiS2F 
which is a newly discovered superconducting material (Tc ~ 0.3 K) [Phys. Rev. B 90, 064518 (2014)].  An 
enhancement of Tc to 2.2 K is observed in Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F. Upon application of pressure Tc is further 
enhanced upto ~10 K (P = 2.5 GPa). Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F is semiconducting down to 3 K. An onset of 
superconductivity like feature is seen at 2.2 K at ambient pressure. At a pressure above 1.38GPa, the Tc
onset 
remains invariant at 10 K but the Tc(ρ=0) is increased to above 8.2 K. There is a possible crystallographic 
transformation by application of pressure from a structure of low Tc to a structure corresponding to high Tc.

1. Introduction  
Tremendous surge for finding new materials or modifying the existing materials for various 
applications has led to discovery of superconductivity in many compounds which were previously 
known but not investigated for their superconducting properties. LnOBiS2 is one such family of 
materials. Discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 at 4.5 K kick-started the research in layered 
Bi ̶ S based materials [1,2]. This led to discovery of superconductivity in F-doped LnOBiS2 (Ln = 
La, Ce, Pr, Nd and Yb; with Tc ~ 2.5 ̶ 10 K) [3–10]. Undoped LnOBiS2 is a band 
semiconductor/insulator [11]. Structurally it consists of alternating rock-salt type BiS2 layers and 
fluorite type edge-shared tetrahedral Ln2O2 layers [12]. Superconductivity could be induced in these 
materials by electron doping; either by F- substitution at O sites or by tetravalent ion (Ti, Zr, Hf and 
Th) substitution at Ln sites [3,4,8–10]. Hole doping has been unsuccessful in inducing 
superconductivity so far [13]. Tc is low (2.5 ̶ 5 K) [9] for the electron-doped samples but could be 
enhanced upto 10 K either by annealing samples under high pressure [3,14,15] or by application of 
external high pressure [16–19]. Very recently a new structurally analogous compound SrBiS2F [20] 
was reported which itself is an semiconductor even under high pressure [21]. It becomes 
superconducting only upon doping with electrons (via La or Ce substitution at Sr site) [22,23]. It is 
noteworthy that Tc increases significantly upon applying hydrostatic pressure in this material 
[24,25]. Since Eu+2 and Sr+2 are similar in size, hence replacement of Sr by Eu to form EuBiS2F 
was tried successfully by Zhai et al [26]. However unlike SrBiS2F, EuBiS2F compound was 
surprisingly found to be metallic and even superconducting though with very low Tc (~ 0.3 K). A 
mixed valence of Eu present in this material leads to self doping and superconductivity [26]. Till 
now there has been no report of any kind of doping or high pressure studies on EuBiS2F. In this

short manuscript we report enhancement of Tc to 2.2 K in Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F and further enhancement 
of Tc to an impressive 10 K by applying external pressure. To our knowledge, this is the first case 
where such a drastic enhancement in Tc has been observed in Bi-S based materials. 
2. Experimental – Polycrystalline sample of nominal composition Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F was synthesized 
via solid state method by the reaction of EuF3, La2S3, Bi2S3 and Eu metal. La2S3 and Bi2S3 were 
presynthesized by the reaction of their respective elements at 800oC and 500oC respectively for 15 h 
in vacuum. Stoichiometric amounts of reactants were mixed well and sealed in an evacuated quartz 
tube and heated at 800oC for 24 hours. The resultant product was reground, pelletized and heated 
again under same conditions. The pellet was black, without luster and stable in air for weeks. 
Sample was characterized by powder x-ray diffraction technique using Cu ̶ Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 
Å). For crystal structure analysis, Rietveld refinement of the powder XRD data was performed by 
using Topas software. Pressure dependent resistivity measurements were carried out by Physical 
Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design). Pressure was applied using HPC ̶ 
33 Piston type pressure cell with Quantum design DC resistivity option. Hydrostatic pressures were 
generated by a BeCu/NiCrAl clamped piston-cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a fluid 
(Daphne Oil) pressure transmitting medium in a Teflon cell. Annealed Pt wires were affixed to 
gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-wire 
configuration.  
3. Results and discussion – Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of the sample confirms the presence 
of EuBiS2F phase as shown in figure 1. Some minor impurity peaks were also detected which 
correspond to Bi2S3 (*) and (#) EuF2.4 (<10 % total). The sample crystallizes in tetragonal CeOBiS2

structure [12] with P4/nmm space group (#129). Crystal structure of (Eu,La)BiS2F is presented in 
figure 1 (b). It consists of Eu2F2 edge shared tetrahedral layers alternating with square pyramidal 
BiS2 layers. Structural parameters were calculated by Rietveld fitting of powder X-ray diffraction 
data in the 2 range 10 – 70o, results of which are shown in Table 1. The obtained lattice parameters 
were a = 4.0744(1) Å and c = 13.3336(7) Å and volume V = 221.35(2) Å3. The c-parameter and 
unit cell volume for La-doped EuBiS2F are markedly smaller than those of the undoped EuBiS2F (c 
=13.5338 Å and V = 222.076 Å3) [26]. This reduction in the cell parameter is indicative of effective 
doping as La3+ ion (1.16 Å) is smaller as compared to Eu2+ (1.25 Å) assuming VIII coordination.  
Resistivity measurements at ambient pressure for Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F are shown in figure 2 (a). A small 
drop in resistivity observed at 2.2 K indicates an onset of superconductivity. We do not observe 
zero resistance at ambient pressure as our measurements were limited down to 2 K only. Certain 
features of these resistivity measurements deserve to be pointed out. 1) An anomaly in resistivity 
around 280 K associated with a charge density wave in undoped EuBiS2F. This has been 
completely suppressed. 2) A semiconducting like normal state behavior is observed (inset of figure 
2 (a)) in our sample which is in contrast with the metal like behavior observed in undoped material 
below CDW (280 K)[26]. This kind of semiconducting behavior is also observed in LnO1-xFxBiS2 
[3,4,9] and Sr0.5Re0.5FBiS2 [22,23] at ambient pressure. Application of pressure creates marked 
effects on these features. Resistivity as a function of temperature under variable pressure is 
presented in figure 2 (b). As the applied pressure increases the semiconducting behavior is 
gradually suppressed and the superconducting transition becomes more and more clearly visible. A 
gradual decreasing trend in resistivity is observed with pressure. The drop in resistivity at 2.2 K (at 
P = 0 GPa) indicating the Tc onset gradually shifts to higher temperatures with application of 


 
 
5 
pressure. This drop in resistivity seems pronounced at higher pressure (upto P = 0.55 GPa). Also at 
this pressure a kink in resistivity starts appearing at ~ 9 K. This kink could be attributed to 
superconductivity in a high Tc phase as it becomes prominent with increasing the pressure (see 
figure 3). It is to be note that a zero resistance state is not observed till a pressure of 0.55 GPa and 
only at 0.97GPa did we observe a zero resistance state with a broad transition width (Tc
onset of 10 K 
and Tc
zero ~ 3 K (figure 3)). On increasing the pressure beyond 1 GPa, the transition width decreases 
and a clear superconducting state is achieved with Tc onset remaining unchanged ~ 10 K but Tc
zero 
shifts to higher temperature with a maximum of 8.2 K for pressure ~ 2.5 GPa (figure 3). The 
criterion on selection of Tc is demonstrated in figure 3. The semiconducting state is suppressed 
completely and a metallic behavior is observed in the normal state at high pressures. Such change 
of semiconducting to metallic state coupled with an appearance of high temperature 
superconducting state is also observed in Sr0.5Re0.5FBiS2 under pressure [24,25]. The sudden jump 
in Tc near 1 GPa indicates a possible transformation of a low Tc phase (Tc < 4 K) to a high Tc phase 
(Tc ~ 9 ̶ 10 K). This jump is clearly evident from Tc v/s pressure phase diagram as shown in figure 4. 
There are already few examples reported in literature which show such kind of phase 
transformation on application of pressure [18,19,27]. But this is the first time it is reported for 
EuBiS2F. A possible structural transformation to a lower symmetry is not ruled out as observed in 
La(O,F)BiS2 [18] and very recently in EuFBiS2[28,29]. 
Moreover to estimate the upper critical field, Hc2 magnetic field dependent resistivity at constant 
pressure (2.5GPa) has been measured and results are shown in figure 5(a). Tc onset shifts only 
slightly upon application of magnetic field but Tc
zero decreases very readily. The value of Hc2(0) is 
estimated using WHH formula; Hc2(0) = -0.693Tc (dHc2/dT) [30]. The Hc2(T) curve fitted with 


 
 
6 
WHH equation is shown in figure 5b which gives the estimated value of Hc2(0) = 10 T. This value 
of Hc2 is significantly smaller than those obtained for Sr0.5Ln0.5FBiS2 under pressure (14  ̶  20 T) 
[24,25]. The upper critical field as estimated by WHH model is quite smaller than the Pauli 
paramagnetic limit Hp = 1.84Tc = 18 T. We also observe flattening of Hc2 curve at high fields (~5 T) 
which we think is due to Pauli spin paramagnetic effect. 
4. Conclusions – We have observed superconductivity with Tc (onset) as high as 10 K in 
Eu0.5La0.5BiS2F under pressure. The possible charge density wave occurring at 280 K in undoped 
material is suppressed upon electron doping and a semiconducting behavior is observed before the 
onset of superconductivity at 2.2 K. Application of external pressure further increases the Tc upto an 
impressive value of 10 K. This is the first report of significant enhancement of Tc by electron 
doping and high pressure in EuBiS2F. We also speculate a possible phase transformation on 
application of pressure.
