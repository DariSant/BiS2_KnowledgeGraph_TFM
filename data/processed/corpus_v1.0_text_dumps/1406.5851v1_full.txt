We present an optical spectroscopy study on F-substituted NdOBiS2 superconducting single crystals grown
using KCl/LiCl ﬂux method. The measurement reveals a simple metallic response with a relatively low screened
plasma edge near 5000 cm−1 . The plasma frequency is estimated to be 2.1 eV, which is much smaller than the
value expected from the ﬁrst-principles calculations for an electron doping level of x=0.5, but very close to the
value based on a doping level of 7% of itinerant electrons per Bi site as determined by ARPES experiment.
The energy scales of the interband transitions are also well reproduced by the ﬁrst-principles calculations. The
results suggest an absence of correlation eﬀect in the compound, which essentially rules out the exotic pairing
mechanism for superconductivity or scenario based on the strong electronic correlation eﬀect. The study also
reveals that the system is far from a CDW instability as being widely discussed for a doping level of x=0.5.

INTRODUCTION
The newly discovered bismuth oxysulﬁde superconductors
have attracted much attention in the past two years. Soon after
the discovery of superconductivity at 4.4 K in Bi4O4S3,1,2 sev-
eral new members of this family, e.g. ReO1−xFxBiS2 (Re= La,
Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb), Sr1−xLaxFBiS2, and La1−xMxOBiS2 (M= Ti,
Zr, Hf, Th), were found.3–10 Those compounds have layered
structures consisting of alternate stacking of superconducting
BiS2 layers and diﬀerent blocking layers. The stacking struc-
ture is analogous to those of high-Tc cuprates11 and Fe-based
superconductors12. Typically, superconductivity arises when
charge carriers are introduced into the parent compound, and
the superconducting transition temperature Tc reaches a max-
imum value at the nominal doping level of x=0.5.3
First principle calculations indicate that the parent com-
pound is a semiconductor with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV,
and superconductivity induced by electron doping is derived
mainly from the 6px/py orbitals in the BiS2 layers.13,14 At the
doping level of x=0.5, a good nesting between the large par-
allel Fermi-surface segments with wave vector q = (π, π, 0)
has been found. It is therefore suggested that the BiS2-based
superconductorsare conventionalphonon-mediatedsupercon-
ductors closed to charge density wave instability.14,15 How-
ever, this picture was not supported by subsequent neutron
scattering experiment.16 The electron-phonon coupling could
be much weaker than theoretically expected. It was proposed
that the strong Fermi surface nesting would enhance the spin
ﬂuctuations, and the electron correlations may play a major
role in superconducting pairing.17–20 At present, there is no
consensus on the origin of superconductivity in those com-
pounds. It is important to distinguish between diﬀerent pic-
tures by performing various experimental measurements.
Most of the early experimental investigations were done
on polycrystalline samples due to the lack of single crys-
tals. Recently, millimeter-sized single crystals were success-
fully grown from alkali metal chloride ﬂux in vacuum,21,22
and two angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)
studies on the electronic structures of NdO1−xFxBiS2 were
reported.23,24 Ye et al. found that the electron correlation is
very weak and the carrier doping is much smaller than that
expected from the nominal ﬂuorine component which they at-
tributed to the Bismuth deﬁciency.23 Another ARPES report
by Zeng et al. based on our samples also indicates rather small
electron pockets around X point corresponding to an elec-
tron doping level of roughly 7% per Bi site.24 Consequently,
most of previous theoretical studies based on the high electron
doping (close to x=0.5) becomes unreliable, and more exper-
iments based on the single crystals are highly desired.
In this work, we report an optical spectroscopy study on
Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystals in combination with the ﬁrst prin-
ciple band structural calculations. The optical measurement
reveals a simple metallic response with a plasma frequency of
2.1 eV. Taking the doping level of 7% of itinerant electrons
per Bi site as determined by ARPES experiment on the same
batch of crystals, the band structure calculations yield almost
the same plasma frequency. Furthermore, the interband transi-
tions at higher energies observed in optical measurement can
also be well reproduced by the band structure calculations.
Those results reveal essentially an absence of correlation ef-
fect in the compound. The study also indicates that the doping
level of superconducting sample is far from CDW instability,
which was widely discussed for a doping level of x=0.5.

EXPERIMENT
F-doped NdOBiS2 superconducting single crystals were
grown using KCl/LiCl (molar ratio KCl:LiCl=3:2) ﬂux
method.
The raw materials with nominal composition of
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 were weighted and mixed with the KCl/LiCl
ﬂux.
The crystal growth procedure is similar to that de-
scribed by Tanaka21 except that we use a diﬀerent molar ratio
of KCl/LiCl:NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 = 25:1. Many dark-grey shiny
plate-like single crystals were obtained. The typical size is 1-
2 mm, and obvious layered structure can be observed under
the microscope with a typical thickness of ∼60µm.
The obtained single crystals were characterized by X-
ray diﬀraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope
equipped with energy dispersion X-rays spectrum (EDX).


2
Bulk magnetization was measured using a Quantum De-
sign superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID-
VSM). Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity was mea-
sured by a standard four-probe method in a Quantum Design
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The opti-
cal reﬂectance measurements were performed on Bruker IFS
113v and 80v spectrometers in the frequency range from 80
to 24 000 cm−1 (10 meV∼3 eV). An in situ gold and alu-
minum overcoating technique was used to obtain the reﬂec-
tivity R(ω). The real part of conductivity σ1(ω) is obtained
by the Kramers-Kronig transformation of R(ω). The Hagen-
Rubens relation was used for low frequency extrapolation; at
high frequency side a ω−1.2 relation was used up to 300 000
cm−1 , above which ω−4 was applied.
We also performed ﬁrst-principle calculations for the elec-
tronic band structure of NdOBiS2 on the basis of the real crys-
tal structure. The optical constants were calculated and com-
pared with experimental results. A detailed description about
the calculations will be presented in the following section.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern for the Nd(O,F)BiS2 single
crystal at room temperature. Only (0 0 l) peaks were observed,
indicating a well developed ab-plane orientation for the crys-
tal sheets. For the as-grown crystals, the c-axis lattice param-
eters was obtained as 13.49 Å, in consistent with the previous
reports.21,22 The averaged composition of the as-grown single
crystals is approximately Nd0.95±0.02OyF0.44±0.1Bi0.94±0.02S2 as
determined by EDX analysis on several pieces of samples.
The composition was normalized to S=2. No Li, K, Cl were
detected in the crystals. In the following part, we use nominal
component Nd(O,F)BiS2 to represent the actual composition
Nd0.95±0.02OyF0.44±0.1Bi0.94±0.02S2.

to the values at 300 K. For the as-grown crystal, the resistiv-
ity values decrease with decreasing the temperature from 300
K, but increase below 100 K before it undergo the supercon-
ducting transition with Tonset
c
= 5.7 K and Tzero
c
= 3.6 K. The
low temperature upturn is likely due to the disorder/defects
of the crystals during the growth procedure. In order to re-
duce the eﬀect, we have sealed the as-grown crystals in an
evacuated silica tube and annealed them at 400 ◦C for 10
hours. After such heat treatment, the in-plane resistivity ρab
reveals a metallic behavior over the entire temperature range
between room temperature and Tzero
c
= 4 K. The zero-ﬁeld-
cooled (ZFC) and ﬁeld-cooled (FC) dc magnetic susceptibility
of the annealed Nd(O,F)BiS2 crystals with H = 10 Oe along
c-axis is displayed in the inset of Fig. 1. A sharp diamagnetic
signal is observed below 3.8 K, indicating a bulk supercon-
ductor. The positive background signal could be due to the
paramagnetism of the Nd ion in the crystals. Apparently, the
annealing reduces the defects and improves the quality of the
crystals. The optical spectroscopy results presented below are
based on the annealed Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystals.
Figure 3 (a) and (b) show the reﬂectance and real part
of conductivity spectra of Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystal over a
broad energy scale at diﬀerent temperatures, respectively. The
value of R(ω) at low frequency is high and increases further
with decreasing temperature, yielding compelling evidence
for a good metallic response. With increasing frequency, R(ω)
drops quickly to a minimum value near 5000 cm−1 , which
is known as the screened plasma edge. Above the edge fre-
quency, the reﬂectance becomes roughly temperature inde-
pendent. The relatively low edge position reveals a low carrier
density, being consistent with a low electron doping level re-
vealed by ARPES.24 As displayed in Fig. 3 (b), the Drude-like
conductivity are observed for all spectra at low frequencies.
At high energies, several interband transition features, for ex-
ample, at 10 500 cm−1 , 14 400 cm−1 , and a weak feature near
18 000 cm−1 , could be well resolved.

where ǫ∞is the dielectric constant at high energy, and the mid-
dle and last terms are the Drude and Lorentz components, re-
spectively. The Drude component represents the contribution
from conduction electrons, while the Lorentz components de-
scribe the interband transitions. The optical conductivity spec-
tra below 20 000 cm−1 could be reasonably ﬁt by one Drude
and three Lorentz components. As an example, we show in
Fig. 4 the room temperature spectrum and decomposed Drude
and Lorentz components. The plasma frequency obtained for
the Drude components is 17 000 cm−1 (∼2.1 eV), and it keeps
roughly unchange at diﬀerent temperatures, while the width,
i.e. the scattering rate 1/τ, in the Drude term decreases with
decreasing temperature, as displayed in the inset of Fig. 3 (a).
The three Lorentz terms centered at 10 500, 14 400 and 17 800
cm−1 , respectively, are attributed to the interband transitions,
and their origins will be discussed below.

lated plasma frequency for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is 5.99 eV.14 This
value is much larger than the value determined by optics in
this work for Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystal. However, as we ex-
plained in the introduction, the recent ARPES measurements
on Nd(O,F)BiS2 actually revealed only smaller Fermi pock-
ets encircling the midpoints on the edge of BZ with a doping
level of roughly 7% per Bi site.24 On this account, we have
to compare the experimental results to theoretical calculations
only at such small doping level.
We performed the ﬁrst-principle calculations of electronic
structure by using the full-potential linearized-augmented
plane-wave(FP-LAPW) method implemented in WIEN2K
package for the real crystal structure of undoped NdOBiS226.
The exchange-correlation potential was treated using the
generalized gradient approximation(GGA) based on the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof(PBE) approach27. Spin-orbit cou-
pling(SOC) was included as a second variational step self-
consistently. The radii of the muﬃn-tin sphere RMT were 2.37
Bohr for Nd, Bi and S and 2.1 Bohr for O, respectively. A
18×18×6 k-point mesh has been utilized in the self-consistent
calculations. For the optical properties calculation28 a ﬁne
grid mesh with 25×25×7 was adopted. The truncation of the
modulus of the reciprocal lattice vector Kmax, which was used
for the expansion of the wave functions in the interstitial re-
gion, was set to RMT ∗Kmax = 7. This parent compound is
a band semiconductor and its Fermi level (EF, set as zero en-
ergy) locates in the energy gap. With electron doping by F
substitution for O, the Fermi level should shift up. Figure 5 (a)
and (b) shows the calculated band dispersions and the Fermi
surfaces with chemical potential being shifted up by 0.85 eV,
which roughly corresponding to a doping level of 7% per Bi
site. The shape and Fermi surface areas are in good agreement
with the ARPES measurement on the same batch of crystals.24
The calculated plasma frequency at this chemical potential is
2.078 eV, which is very close to the experimental value. Fig-

ure 5 (c) shows the real and imagine parts of dielectric func-
tion contributed for the interband transitions below 4 eV, the
free carrier contributions are not considered in this plot.
Since the scattering rate of free carriers is not a theoreti-
cally calculated quantity, the spectral shape of Drude compo-
nent could not be given by ﬁrst-principle band calculations.
For the reason of making a comparison with experiment, we
add a value of the scattering rate for the Drude component
by hand. Then the spectrum of the Drude part could also
be displayed. The calculated real part of conductivity by as-
suming a scattering rate value of 1600 cm−1 is also displayed
Fig. 4. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that the calculated conductiv-
ity curve can well reproduce the experimental curve not only
for the low frequency Drude component but also for the en-
ergy scales of the interband transitions. The diﬀerent val-
ues of the conductivities at high energy higher than 15 000
cm−1 could be largely attributed to the high energy extrapola-
tions in Kramers-Kronig transformation.
According to the band structural calculations, there should
be four major interband transitions below the energy of 4 eV,
as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 5. Those interband transi-
tions lead to peaks in the imaginary part of the dielectric func-
tion. The peak at the lowest energy near 0.25 eV is from the
transition between two parallel bands from Bi p orbitals being
caused by the Bi-Bi inter-layer coupling. The peak near 1.25
eV is from the transition between two parallel bands from Bi
px and py orbitals arising from the in-plane p-p σ-bond and
p-p π-bond. The peaks near 1.8 eV and 2.1 eV both come
from the transition between S or O p-bands to Bi p-bands.
The last three could be well resolved in the optical conductiv-
ity spectra at respective energies. However, the lowest inter-
band transition near 0.25 eV is embedded in the strong peak
from the Drude response of free carriers and could hardly be
distinguished from the experimental data. Since the plasma
frequency determined by experiment is even slightly higher
than that of ﬁrst-principle calculations, it is very likely that
such interband transition is indeed present in the experimen-
tal data. Nevertheless, this interband transition must be ex-
tremely weak in intensity and only a very small fraction of
spectral weight is taken from the Drude component.
Usually, the ratio of experimental kinetic energy Kexpt
to that of the theoretical kinetic energy Kband from density
functional calculations provides a measure of the degree of
correlation.29,30 The kinetic energy is proportional to the spec-
tral weight ω2
p/8 deﬁned as the area under the Drude part of
σ1(ω). The extremely close values of the plasma frequen-
cies determined by both experiment and GGA calculations
implies Kexpt/Kband = ω2
p,expt/ω2
p,band ≈1, suggesting that the
Nd(O,F)BiS2 crystal is a simple metal and correlation eﬀect is
almost absent. The result is consistent with the recent ARPES
report.23
The absence of the electronic correlation eﬀect and the sur-
prisingly good agreement of optical data between the exper-
imental measurement and the ﬁrst-principle calculations in-
dicate that the BiS2-based compound is an ordinary metal.
The scenario for the superconductivity based on the exotic
pairing mechanism or strong electronic correlation eﬀect is
not well grounded. The small plasma frequency, which is
in good agreement with the small Fermi surfaces observed
from ARPES measurements, suggests that the compound is
far from the CDW instability at the doping level of x=0.5
as proposed in early theoretical calculations. As proposed in
early work,23 the smaller doping level could be due to the pres-
ence of Bi vacancies in the samples.

SUMMARY
To summarize, we have grown F-substituted NdOBiS2 su-
perconducting single crystals using KCl/LiCl ﬂux method.
The annealed crystals show a typical metallic behavior with
a superconducting transition temperature near 4 K. We per-
formed a combined optical spectroscopy and ﬁrst principle
band structural calculation study on Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crys-
tal. The optical measurement reveals a simple metallic behav-
ior with a relatively small plasma frequency of 2.1 eV. Taking
the doping level of 7% of itinerant electrons per Bi site as
determined by ARPES experiment on the same batch of crys-
tals, the band structure calculations not only well reproduce
the spectral weight of the low frequency Drude component
but also the energy scales of the interband transitions. Those
results indicate essentially the absence of correlation eﬀect in
the compound. The study also illustrates that the doping level
of superconducting compound is far from the CDW instability
suggested in early studies for a doping level of x=0.5.
