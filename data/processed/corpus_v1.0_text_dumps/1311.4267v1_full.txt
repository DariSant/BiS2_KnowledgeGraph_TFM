Abstract 
 We show the observation of the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and ferromagnetism 
in CeO1-xFxBiS2(x = 0 - 1.0) prepared by annealing under high-pressure. In CeO1-xFxBiS2 
system, both superconductivity and two types of ferromagnetism with respective magnetic 
transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 K are induced upon systematic F substitution. This 
fact suggests that carriers generated by the substitution of O by F are supplied to not only the 
BiS2 superconducting layers but also the CeO blocking layers. Furthermore, the highest 
superconducting transition temperature is observed when the ferromagnetism is also enhanced,

which implies that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are linked to each other in the 
CeO1-xFxBiS2 system.

Introduction 
 Layered superconductors are attractive materials due to the discovery of superconductors 
with high transition temperatures and unconventional 
mechanisms 
behind their 
superconductivity, which cannot be explained by the conventional BCS theory [1-13]. 
Furthermore, some compounds show superconductivity which coexist with long range 
magnetic ordering [14-28]. Since long range magnetic ordering usually competes against 
superconductivity, the materials possessing the coexistence of superconductivity and 
magnetism are of great interest for basic physics and applications.   
Recently, new layered superconductors with superconducting BiS2 layers intermixed with 
blocking layers were discovered [29-40]. As-grown LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a typical BiS2-based 
superconductor and shows superconductivity with a temperature (Tc) of 3 K. The Tc increases 
up to 10 K by annealing under high-pressure. This fact indicates that the optimization of local 
crystal structure is important for superconductivity with a higher transition temperature in the 
BiS2-based superconductors [41-47]. Another typical BiS2-based material is CeO1-xFxBiS2, 
which shows weak signal of superconductivity around 3 K while exhibiting ferromagnetism 
in the CeO blocking layers at low temperature. This result suggests that ferromagnetism and 
superconductivity could coexist in this system. If bulk superconductivity of the BiS2 layers 
could be induced while keeping the ferromagnetic ordering in the CeO layers, CeO1-xFxBiS2 
could become one of the potential materials which achieves the coexistence of

ferromagnetism and superconductivity. 
  Here, we show the observation of the coexistence of ferromagnetism and bulk 
superconductivity in CeO1-xFxBiS2 annealed under high-pressure. Furthermore, the established 
phase diagram suggests that superconductivity in the BiS2 layers and ferromagnetism in the 
CeO layers are linked to each other. 
 
Experimental 
The polycrystalline samples of CeO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0 - 1.0) were prepared with a solid-state 
reaction and then annealed under high-pressure using a Cubic-Anvil-type high-pressure 
machine. Bi2S3 powders were obtained by sintering the mixtures of Bi grains and S grains in 
the evacuated quartz tube at 500 °C for 10 hours. Mixtures of Bi grains, Bi2S3 grains, Bi2O3 
powders, BiF3 powders and Ce2S3 powders with nominal compositions of CeO1-xFxBiS2(x = 
0.0 - 1.0) were ground, pelletized, and sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was 
heated at 800 °C for 10 hours. The obtained pellets were ground and annealed at 600 °C for 1 
hour under a hydrostatic pressure of 3 GPa. We denote as-grown samples as AG, and high 
pressure samples as HP in this paper. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray 
diffraction with Cu-K radiation using the -2 method. The temperature dependence of 
magnetic susceptibility was measured by a superconducting quantum interface device 
(SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 10 Oe. The resistivity measurements were 


 
5
performed using the four-terminal method from 300 to 2 K.  
Results 
  Figure 1(a) and (b) show the powder X-ray diffraction profile for the as-grown (AG) and 
high-pressure (HP) samples of CeO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.0 - 1.0), respectively. Almost all of the 
peaks are indexed to the space group P4/nmm for both the AG and HP samples. Impurity 
phases of Bi2S3 appear above x = 0.7. Enlarged XRD figures near the (110), (114) and (200) 
peaks for the AG samples are shown in Fig.1(c). These each present themselves as a single 
peak between x = 0.0 and 0.6. However, other peaks appear above x = 0.7 and become 
stronger with increasing F concentration. Furthermore, the peaks of the tetragonal phase 
seem to shift with increasing F concentration. These facts imply that another phase appears 
or the tetragonal structure is strained above x = 0.7. Tomita et al. reported a structural 
transition from tetragonal to monoclinic in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high-pressure [46]. Having 
considered the fact in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, structural transition or anisotropic strain could occur 
with decreasing lattice volume in the CeO1-xFxBiS2 system as well. The observed peaks of 
CeO1-xFxBiS2 samples may partly begin to be strained into a lower-symmetry phase due to 
lattice contraction upon F substitution. The lattice constants a and c of the AG and HP 
samples are plotted against the nominal x dependence in Fig. 1(d) and (e). These lattice 
constants were estimated from the 2values and the corresponding Miller indices. For the 
as-grown samples, the a lattice constant increases with increasing F concentration between x 


 
6
= 0.0 and 0.6, while they slightly decrease above x = 0.7. The c lattice constant markedly 
decreases between x = 0.0 and 0.6 and keeps an almost constant value from x = 0.7 to 1.0. 
This decrease in the c lattice constant between x = 0.0 and 0.6 indicates that F substitutes O 
as expected. After high pressure annealing, the a and c lattice constant exhibit almost the 
same behavior as the AG samples for all F concentrations. Therefore, the change of the 
crystal structure before and after high-pressure annealing is not large, but some local 
structures should be tuned because superconducting properties significantly change after 
high-pressure annealing.  
   The temperature dependence of resistivity for AG samples of CeO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0 - 1.0) 
are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (b). The resistivity for all F-doped samples increases with 
decreasing temperature. This semiconducting behavior in the normal-state region is the same 
as that of LnO1-xFxBiS2 (Ln=La, Nd, Pr, Nd, Yb) and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 [30-37]. The low 
temperature region is enlarged in Fig. 2(c) and (d). The Tc
onset is regarded as the crossing 
point of the fitting lines for resistivity in the normal state near the transition and the drop 
area during the transition. The Tc
zero is estimated as the crossing point of the line for zero 
resistivity and the -T curve. Superconductivity does not appear between x = 0.0 and 0.4. 
Above x = 0.45, the onset of the superconducting transition is observed for all the samples. 
Zero resistivity is observed between x = 0.45 and 0.7. The temperature dependence of 
resistivity for CeO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0 - 1.0) after high-pressure annealing is shown in Fig. 3(a).

All the samples show a semiconducting behavior in the normal state. The samples above x = 
0.3 exhibits the onset of the superconducting transition, as shown in Fig. 3(b). A Tc
onset is 
observed around 3 K for samples where x = 0.3, 0.4, 0.45, and 1.0. The sample with x = 0.6 
shows the onset of superconducting transition around 6 K. For x = 0.7 and 0.9, Tc
onset is 
observed around 8 K. Tc
zero is not observed between x < 0.6 in the temperature range down to 
2 K. For 0.6 ≤ x ≤ 0.9, bulk superconductivity is observed. Among them, CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 
shows the maximum Tc
onset of 7.8 K. The fact that bulk superconductivity with higher Tc 
appears for x ≥ 0.6 seems to be consistent with the observation of structural change revealed 
in Fig. 1(c).  
The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for the AG samples of the 
CeO1-xFxBiS2 is shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Paramagnetic behavior is observed for samples 
where x = 0.0 - 0.4. A superconducting transition appears around 2.5 K for samples where x 
= 0.45, 0.5 and o.6. In these samples, the magnetic susceptibility increases around 4.5 K with 
decreasing temperature. Furthermore, the x = 0.6 sample exhibits two anomalies at 4.5 K and 
7.5 K. Above x = 0.7, the magnetic susceptibility largely increases at 7.5K. The increase of 
magnetic susceptibility suggests that two ferromagnetic phases with respective magnetic 
transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 K exist. Magnetic susceptibility measurements for 
HP samples are presented in Fig. 5(a) and (b). After high pressure annealing, 
superconductivity around 6 K appears when x = 0.7 and 0.9. In this region, ferromagnetism 


 
8
at 7.5 K is dominant. CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 shows the strongest diamagnetic signal among all the 
samples, while exhibiting ferromagnetic ordering below 7.5 K. 
 
 We summarize the F concentration dependence of ferromagnetism and the 
superconducting transition temperature in the phase diagram of Fig. 6(a) and (b) to 
understand the physical properties of the CeO1-xFxBiS2 system. From Fig. 6(a), the 
ferromagnetic phases observed at 4.5 K and 7.5 K are given the terms lower temperature 
phase and higher temperature phase respectively. The lower temperature phase (4.5 K) exists 
between x = 0.45 and 0.6, and coexists with the higher temperature phase (7.5 K) at x = 0.6. 
Above x = 0.6, the higher temperature phase (7.5 K) can be observed. In Fig. 6(b), the AG 
samples show superconductivity from x = 0.45 to 1.0. After high-pressure annealing, 
superconductivity appears in a large region between x = 0.3 and 1.0. The Tc of the HP 
samples is obviously higher than that of the AG samples.  
   
Discussion 
  In this section, we will discuss the interesting points of CeO1-xFxBiS2. We found that 
ferromagnetism and superconductivity simultaneously develop with systematic F doping. In 
particular, two ferromagnetic phases with respective transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 
K were induced with increasing F concentration. This result indicates that carriers generated 
by F doping are provided to, not only the superconducting BiS2 layers, but also the blocking 


 
9
CeO layers. Thus, we suggest that the observed two ferromagnetic phases are a result of the 
change in the valence of the Ce ion with changing the F concentration. We found that bulk 
superconductivity of CeO1-xFxBiS2 could be induced with x ≥ 0.6 in the HP samples. 
Interestingly, the F concentration where bulk superconductivity appears corresponds to the F 
concentration where ferromagnetism with a transition temperature of 7.5 K. In this regard, we 
assume that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are linked to each other in the 
CeO1-xFxBiS2. In fact, the region with F concentration level of x ≥ 0.7 corresponds with the F 
concentration where the XRD peaks show the obvious change from the tetragonal phase with 
lower F concentration. Above x = 0.7, the crystal structure is possibly optimized for the 
appearance of both ferromagnetism and bulk superconductivity due to high F concentration. 
In order to reveal this simultaneous development of ferromagnetism and bulk 
superconductivity, it is quite important to carry out crystal structure analysis and 
measurements sensitive to the magnetic ordering and the valence state of the Ce ion using 
single crystals of CeO1-xFxBiS2.  
Conclusion 
  We found that the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and ferromagnetism can be 
realized in the BiS2-based superconductor CeO1-xFxBiS2 prepared by high-pressure annealing. 
In the as-grown samples, weak superconductivity phase and two kinds of ferromagnetic 
orderings with transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 K are induced through the continuous 


 
10
substitution of F. This result indicates that carriers generated by the F substitution contribute 
to both the superconducting and blocking layers. Furthermore, we found that Tc can be 
increased from 3 K to 8 K by high-pressure annealing at x = 0.7 and 0.9. These samples show 
strong diamagnetism while keeping the ferromagnetic ordering. Therefore, bulk 
superconductivity and ferromagnetism intrinsically coexist in CeO1-xFxBiS2 prepared with 
high-pressure annealing. The enhancement of Tc is achieved around x = 0.7, where the higher 
temperature ferromagnetic phase (7.5 K) becomes dominant. This fact implies that the 
appearance of the higher Tc is linked to the evolution of ferromagnetism with the higher 
magnetic transition temperature of 7.5 K. The CeO1-xFxBiS2 system is a potential system for 
discussing the correlation between superconductivity and ferromagnetism, and for further 
applications in superconductivity.
