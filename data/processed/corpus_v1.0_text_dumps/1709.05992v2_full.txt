In this study, the superconducting gap symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is elucidated through speciﬁc
heat measurements with one single crystal of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. A clear jump is observed at 3.95 K
in LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, suggesting bulk superconductivity. From speciﬁc heat measurements, ∆Ce/γTc
and 2∆(0)/kBTc are obtained as 2.31 and 4.5. These values indicate strong electron–phonon coupling
superconductivity. The temperature (T ) and magnetic-ﬁeld (H) dependence of the electronic speciﬁc
heat Ce(T, H) suggests that superconductivity is fully gapped. Our handmade system successfully
elucidates superconducting gap symmetry of the BiS2-based compound with a small single crystal.

INTRODUCTION
Superconductivity of the BiS2-based layered com-
pounds Bi4O3S4 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 has attracted much
attention[1–6].
Their crystal structure consists of the
LaO-blocking and BiS2-conducting layers, and is very
similar to FeAs-based high-Tc superconductor. By anal-
ogy with the FeAs-based superconductor and the BiS2-
based superconductor, it is highly possible that the origin
of the superconducting (SC) transition mechanism is un-
conventional.
The band structure calculation suggests the existence
of a strong nesting of the Fermi surface at wave vec-
tor k = (π, π)[7–10].
The importance of the nesting
is experimentally pointed out and shows the possibility
that electronic correlations play an important role in the
emergence of superconductivity of these systems. How-
ever, it was argued that eﬀect of the electron correlation
is a trivial factor in this system. The conduction band
in the 2D layer of BiS2-based compounds is mainly con-
tributed from 6px and 6py orbits of Bi[10]. Because of the
widely spread 6p orbitals, the electron correlation eﬀects
appear to be unimportant.
A strong electron correla-
tion is signiﬁcant for unconventional superconductivity.
Thus, it is central issue to elucidate whether interactions
that mediate the Cooper pair of superconductivity is un-
conventional.
Extensive theoretical studies have proposed the SC
gap structures, which are intimately related to the
paring interaction[7–13].
Experimentally, unconven-
tional superconductivity can be expected to be gener-
ated because an extremely large ratio of 2∆/kBTc ∼
17, which is about ﬁve times larger than the BCS the-
ory is found in scanning-tunneling microscopy (STM)
measurements[14].
To determine SC gap symmetry, µSR measurements
of polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 are per-
formed, and suggest that superconductivity is fully

sity of Science, Tokyo 125-8585, Japan; n-kase@rs.tus.ac.jp
gapped[15].
Furthermore, several measurements of a
single crystal of Nd(O, F)BiS2 imply fully gapped su-
perconductivity.
Raman scattering suggests a possi-
ble phonon-mediated superconductivity[16]. Penetration
depth and thermal conductivity measurements have been
reported for a fully gapped superconductor[17, 18]. How-
ever, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurement suggests that NdO0.71F0.29BiS2
is an unconventional superconductor that has compet-
itive or cooperative multiple pairing interactions[19].
Thus, SC symmetry of the BiS2-based compounds is con-
troversial.
Speciﬁc heat is one of the most signiﬁcant tool for un-
derstanding SC state and to conﬁrm bulk nature of super-
conductivity thermodynamically. However, speciﬁc heat
measurements have not been performed to clarify SC gap
symmetry in BiS2-superconductors, even though conﬁr-
mation about bulk nature of superconductivity has been
reported[20–22]. The diﬃculty in measuring the speciﬁc
heat of BiS2-compounds at low temperatures is due to the
need of treating a small single crystal with a small Som-
merfeld coeﬃcient. To overcome the present situation,
we constructed a hand-made sensitive calorimeter, which
allows us to implement high precision measurements, and
is a powerful tool to determine SC symmetry.
In this article,
we report temperature and mag-
netic ﬁeld dependences of speciﬁc heat C(T, H) of
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe by using the sensitive calorimeter with
one piece of single crystal (less than 1 mg).
The
Se-substituted compounds LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1−xSex)2 are
known to emergence bulk superconductivity with the op-
timum Se content x of 0.5[23, 24]. Through our measure-
ments, we have succeeded to elucidate the SC-gap sym-
metry of the BiS2-based compound by using one piece of
single crystal.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS AND RESULTS
Single crystals of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe
were grown by using a CsCl/NaCl-ﬂux method[25, 26].
As shown in Fig. 1(b), the typical size of the single crys-

tals is approximately 1 × 1 mm2. The crystal structure
of the synthesized sigle-crystalline sample was examined
through powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) implemented
using a conventional X-ray spectrometer equipped with
Cu-Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator (RAD-
2X, Rigaku). The lattice constants of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe
were estimated to be 0.41074 and 1.3486 nm, and of
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were 0.40512 and 1.3410 nm.
These
values are almost consistent with those of the previous
reports[23, 24].
Superconductivity was conﬁrmed by the T -dependence
of the electrical resistivity ρ(T ) measurements, which
were performed using a conventional four-probe method
with a current source (Model 6221, Keithley) and a nano
voltmeter (Model 2182A, Keithley), down to 0.5 K in zero
and various applied magnetic ﬁelds. Gold wires were at-
tached to the sample surface by Ag paste. Figure 1(c)
shows ρ(T ) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe up to
room temperature. ρ(T ) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows semi-
metallic behavior with a residual resistivity ρ0 of approx-
imately 5.8 mΩcm:
whereas ρ(T ) of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe
behaves as almost T -linear dependent with ρ0 = 0.47
mΩcm. Both compounds show superconductivity. Tc in
ρ(T ) is deﬁned as a 50% drop from ρ0, and the supercon-
ducting transition width ∆T is taken as the temperature
interval between 10% and 90% of ρ0. Tc is determined to
be 2.2 and 3.95 K with ∆T = 0.7 and 0.02 K, respectively.
Only one piece of specimen is suﬃcient to perform spe-
ciﬁc heat measurements, because the background value is

Speciﬁc heat measurements were performed through a
relaxation method down to 0.4 K by using a commer-
cial 3He refrigerator (Heliox-VL, Oxford Instruments)
equipped with a superconducting magnet (Oxford in-
struments). Our hand-made system consists of a heater
and thermometer (RuO2 chip resistor) without a sample
stage. The sample was sandwiched between the heater
and thermometer, which were hung by using NbTi SC
wires attached using an Ag paste on the surfaces of the
RuO2 chip resistor to form an electrode. As the bottom
of the chip resistor consists of an Al2O3 insulator, the
sample cannot be electrically contacted with the heater
and thermometer. Figure 1(d) presents the setup for the
measurement of C(T ). A single crystal of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
(1.40 mg) and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (0.42 mg) ﬁxed using N
grease between the heater and thermometer was used for
the measurements.
Figures 2(a) and (b) show the T -
dependence of the speciﬁc heat C(T ) divided by T of
raw data (sample + background) and background down
to 0.4 K. The contribution of the background is relatively
smaller than that of one specimen. The background value
is comparable to that of the sample even at 0.4 K. Thus,
we determined the validity that our hand-made system

enables to measure the accurate values of small single
crystals of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.
Figure 2(e) and (f) show C(T )/T of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe in zero magnetic ﬁeld. The bulk
nature of the superconductivity can be conﬁrmed because
of the clear jump at Tc = 3.95 K, which is consistent with
Tc determined by ρ(T ). The transition is very sharp with
a transition width of 0.2 K, indicating good sample qual-
ity. However, no jump was observed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2,
although the slope seems to change at the temperature
in which ρ(T ) shows zero resistivity. This result suggests
that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is not of bulk
nature. These results correspond to those of magnetic
susceptibility measurements.
Figure 3(a) shows C(T )/T of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe in mag-
netic ﬁelds of 0 and 1 T. To describe the speciﬁc heat data
at µ0H = 1.0 T, which exceeds Hc2(0), we use the follow-
ing expression: C(T )/T = γ + βT 2 + δT 4, where γ is the
electronic speciﬁc heat coeﬃcient (Sommerfeld constant),
and βT 2 + δT 4 (= Cph) is the lattice vibration contribu-
tion. We obtained parameters γ = 4.19 mJ/(mol·K2), β
= 1.34 mJ/(mol·K4), and δ = 0.0198 mJ/(mol·K6). In
a simple Debye model of the phonon contribution, the
β coeﬃcient is related to the Debye temperature ΘD =
( 12π4
5β nR)1/3, where R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) is the gas con-
stant and n = 5 is the number of atoms per formula unit.
From this relationship, ΘD is estimated to be 194 K.
Next, we discuss the detailed T -dependence of the elec-
tronic speciﬁc heat Ce(T ) of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.
Figure
3(b) shows Ce(T ) divided by T of the Se-doped sam-
ple. Ce(T )/T was ﬁtted to the theoretical curve assuming

where f = [exp(βE) + 1]−1 and β = (kBTc)−1. The en-
ergy of quasiparticles is given by E =

ε2 + ∆2(t)
1/2,
where ε is the energy of the normal electrons relative to
the Fermi energy. In addition, the T -dependence of an
energy gap varies as ∆(t) = ∆(0)δ(t), where δ(t) is the
normalized BCS gap, as calculated by Muhlschlegel[28].
The result reproduces the experimental data quite well
in a wide temperature range just below Tc down to 0.5
K. The entropy balance is satisﬁed, and we obtained Tc
= 3.95 K and ∆(0)/kBTc = 2.25, where ∆(0) is the am-
plitude of the SC gap at T →0 K (solid line).
The
value is clearly smaller than 2∆/kBTc ∼17 obtained from
STM[14]. For comparison, we also plot the BCS curve for
the weak electron–phonon coupling limit (dotted line).
As shown in Fig. 3(b), a clear residual linear term γ0 =
0.60 mJ/(mol·K2) is observed in the T →0 K limit from
C(T )/T . This may have originated from a small fraction
of the non–SC phases. After subtracting the impurity
concentration γ0, we found the Sommerfeld coeﬃcient to
be γn = γ – γ0 = 3.59 mJ/(mol·K2). The normalized
speciﬁc heat jump was estimated to be ∆Ce/γTc = 2.31,
which is larger than 1.43 in the weak-coupling limit. Our
results strongly suggest a strong electron–phonon cou-
pling.
Next,
we discuss the H-dependence of the low-
temperature part of the electronic speciﬁc heat Ce(H),
which is known to be very sensitive to the SC struc-
ture.
The inset of Fig.
3(b) shows Ce(H) divided by
T at 0.5 K in magnetic ﬁeld applied perpendicular to
the ab-plane (H||c). Ce(H)/T shows a H-linear depen-
dence in a wide magnetic-ﬁeld range. Rapid increase de-
tected from the H-dependence of the thermal conductiv-
ity κ(H) of NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 is not seen in Ce(H). We
note a small upturn of Ce(T )/T at approximately 0.5 K
in zero magnetic ﬁeld. The origin is likely to be a nu-
clear speciﬁc heat but the upturn is suppressed in higher
magnetic ﬁled. We consider that the upturn is ascribed
to the background contribution, which is insuﬃciently

subtracted from raw data[29]. The increase is about 0.18
and 0.015 mJ/(mol·K2) in magnetic ﬁelds of 0 and 0.2 T.
The eﬀect of the upturn on Ce(H) is vanishingly small
enough to discuss the SC gap even in 0.5 K. Thus, Ce(H)
also provides supporting evidence for a fully gapped SC
state.
The upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2(T ) was obtained from
the ρ(T ) measurements in several magnetic ﬁelds, as
shown in Fig.
4(a) and (b).
The µ0Hc2(T ) curves
show clear enhancement from the Wertharmer–Helfand–
Hohenberg (WHH) theory[30, 31] in the dirty limit (dot-
ted line) and upper curvature around Tc. The features
are usually understood as a multi-gap SC, but are also
originated from spin-orbit and/or strong electron-phonon
coupling[31, 32]. Because our measurements suggest sin-
gle SC gap, it is inadequate to employ the multi-gap
ﬁt. The Hc2(0) was estimated from the ﬁtting formula
Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)

1 −(T/Tc)3/23/2 for superconductors
with upper curvature[33]. The µ0Hc2(0) was evaluated
to be approximately 18.5 T for H || ab and 0.572 T for
H || c. This value is consistent with that of the previous
report[25]. The anisotropic parameter Γ was determined
using the anisotropic Ginzburg–Landau (GL) formula.

c2 = Φ0/(2πξ2
ab), where
Φ0 is the quantum ﬂux. The ξab and ξc were estimated
to be 24.0 and 0.742 nm.
The Γ was obtained to be
approximately 32.3, suggesting that the superconductor
has remarkably high anisotropy.
As shown in Fig. 4(c), the thermodynamic critical ﬁeld
µ0Hc(T ), which is directly related to the condensation
energy of the superconductor through ∆F = H2

estimated by using the relationship,

Inset of Fig. 4(c) shows that Hc(T ) follows the parabolic
form Hc(T ) = Hc(0)(1 −t2), where t = T/Tc, at low tem-
peratures. µ0Hc(0) is determined unambiguously from
an extrapolation to T = 0, and the obtained value is
µ0Hc(0) = 18.5 mT.

mately 0.123 and 1.89 mT and λ(0) was calculated to be

DISCUSSION
Lastly,
we
discuss
the
SC
gap
symmetry
of
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.
Our measurements of Ce(T, H) sug-
gest that a single SC gap is fully opened. µSR measure-
ments of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 show multiple SC gap. Speciﬁc
heat measurement is insensitive to light bands, because
Ce(T )/T at low temperatures is proportional to N(E).
It is likely that contribution from minor bands, which
is not detected from speciﬁc heat can be seen in µSR
measurements. Theoretically, the candidates of SC gap
symmetry are proposed as follows: the conventional s-
wave, spin triplet p, and d-wave symmetries. Although
speciﬁc heat measurements imply that the superconduc-
tivity is fully gapped, d-wave symmetry can be realized
in the disconnect Fermi surfaces. The Fermi surface of
the Se-doped compound is not elucidated at this stage.
Assuming that the Fermi surface of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe con-
tains disconnected small electron pockets at the Brillouin
Zone boundary, such as the under doped Nd(O, F)BiS2,
dxy symmetry is ruled out and dx2−y2 symmetry can be
realized. In addition, in the case of an increase in the Se-
doped value, which changes into the Fermi surface with
hole pockets around the Γ point, s± symmetry can be re-
alized. However, the emergence of unconventional super-
conductivity with sign reversal change is unlikely. Mean
free path ℓab is calculated from ℓab = µ0vab
F λ2
ab(0)/ρ0.
Fermi velocity vF is estimated to be 0.11 × 106 m/s by


5
using the relationship ξab = 0.18(ℏvab
F /kBTc).
We ob-
tain ℓab ∼10 nm, which is clearly shorter than ξab. The
result suggests that superconductivity is in dirty limit.
As superconductivity with sign-reversal change is very
sensitive to impurity scattering, it is likely that nodal
d-wave state cannot be realized in the Se-doped com-
pound.
In the case of s±-wave state seen in Fe-based
superconductors, the robustness against the impurities
should be proved in a more complete way, because sim-
ple substitution eﬀect could be insuﬃcient to reveal sign-
reversal change in SC gap. Since distinct multi-gap fea-
ture can be detected from speciﬁc heat measurements of
the Fe-based superconductors[34, 35], the eﬀective mass
of minor bands is signiﬁcantly large.
However, single-
gap structure detected in the Ce(T, H) measurements of
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe indicates that the mass of the minor
bands is negligible.
Therefore, we suggest that the s-
wave structure can be the best candidate for the SC-gap
symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.
IV.
CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, to conﬁrm bulk superconductivity and
reveal the SC-gap symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, speciﬁc
heat measurements were performed using a hand-made
sensitive calorimeter. Speciﬁc heat measurement shows
that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is of bulk na-
ture.
A large speciﬁc heat jump (∆Ce/γTc = 2.31)
shows strong electron–phonon coupling. 2∆(0)/kBTc ob-
tained from the T -dependence of the electronic speciﬁc
heat Ce(T ) below Tc is 4.5, and suggests strong electron–
phonon coupling. The value is much smaller than that
obtained from STM measurements (2∆/kBTc ∼17)[14].
T - and H-dependences of the speciﬁc heat measurements
imply that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is fully
gapped.
These results are consistent with the s-wave
symmetry proposed for the SC state of BiS2-based su-
perconductors.
