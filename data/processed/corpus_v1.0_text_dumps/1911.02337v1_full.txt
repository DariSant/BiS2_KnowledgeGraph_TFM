Abstract 
Superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were successfully grown using KI-KCl flux. The 
obtained single crystals were flat-shaped and their size was 500 μm. The structure and 
composition of the obtained single crystals were obtained using X-ray diffraction and X-ray 
spectroscopy. The lattice constants of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were evaluated 
to be a = 3.9672(4) Å and c = 13.417(6) Å, while their F/(O + F) molar ratio was approximately 
0.17. The superconducting transition temperature of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals 
was 4.8 K. This was different from the reported Sm(O,F)BiS2 with no superconducting transition 
above 2 K. The superconducting anisotropies of the upper critical field and effective mass model 
of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were estimated to be approximately 26 and 10, 
respectively.

1. Introduction 
The discovery of BiS2-layered superconductors, Bi4O4S3,1 brought about a variety of BiS2 
superconductors. In particular, R(O,F)BiS2 (R: rare earth element) were reported to present 
superconducting transition temperatures, Tc, ranging from 2 to 10 K.2-6 The correlation between 
Tc and R suggested that the high chemical pressure induced by rare earth elements featuring 
smaller ion radii caused higher Tc values.7 Indeed, the Tc of Nd(O,F)BiS2 (~5 K) was higher than 
those of Pr(O,F)BiS2 (~4 K), Ce(O,F)BiS2 (~3 K), and La(O,F)BiS2 (~3 K).8 Nonetheless, 
superconducting transition of Sm(O,F)BiS2 has not been observed above 2 K,9 even though the 
ionic radius of Sm is smaller than those of La-Nd.  
Growth of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals is important for evaluating the intrinsic properties of 
R(O,F)BiS2 superconductors, since impurities and grain boundaries could contribute to the 
properties of polycrystalline samples. Moreover, anisotropic properties cannot be evaluated using 
polycrystalline samples. To the best of our knowledge, superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals have not been grown yet. To grow R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals, alkali chloride fluxes, 
such as CsCl and CsCl-KCl, are generally used.10-14 We tried to grow Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals using CsCl-based flux. However, the major products were Bi2S3 single crystals. A new 
flux suitable for growing R(O,F)BiS2 may extend the variety of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals.  
In this paper, we report the growth and characterization of superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals using KI-KCl flux. Eutectic temperature of the flux is approximately 599 °C. The 
composition, physical properties, and superconducting properties of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals were subsequently investigated.

2. Experimental 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown using KI-KCl flux. The raw materials: Sm2S3, Bi2S3, 
Bi2O3, BiF3, and Bi were weighed to achieve the nominal composition of SmO0.5F0.5BiS2. The 
molar ratio of the KI-KCl flux was KI:KCl = 3:2. The mixture of raw materials (0.8 g) and KI-
KCl flux (5.0 g) (Molar ratio SmO0.5F0.5BiS2:KI:KCl = 1.00:12.78:8.52) were ground using a 
mortar and pestle, and then sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The quartz tube was heated at 
700 °C for 10 h, and subsequently cooled to 600 °C at the rate of 0.5 °C/h. Then, the sample was 
cooled to room temperature, while still in the furnace. The heated quartz tube was then opened in 
air, and the obtained materials were washed and filtered using distilled water to remove the KI-
KCl flux.  
The obtained single crystals were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, TM3030, 
Hitachi High-Technologies). The compositional ratio of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was 
evaluated using energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, Quantax 70, Bruker), and the 
obtained values were normalized using the atomic content of S (CS) = 2.00, while Sm and Bi 
were measured. On the other hand, the atomic ratio of O and F was determined using electron 
probe microanalysis (EPMA, JXA-8200, JEOL), and was normalized using CO + CF = 1.00, 
assuming that the molar ratio of (O+F):S is 1:2 according to the crystal structure of tetragonal 
La(O,F)BiS2 (P4/nmm).15 X-ray diffraction (XRD, MultiFlex, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation 
was employed to identify the crystal structure and determine their orientation and c-axis lattice 
constants. Synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SPXRD) measurements were performed at the 
BL02B2 of SPring-8 with the approval of 2018B1246. The wavelength of the radiation beam 


 
5
was determined to be 0.496345(1) Å using a CeO2 standard. The magnetization-temperature (M-
T) characteristics under zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals were measured using a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) 
magnetometer, which featured the applied field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis. Magnetization 
was converted to magnetic susceptibility (4πχ) using the density of SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 in the 
previous report.9 The resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) characteristics of the obtained single crystals 
were measured using the standard four-probe method, in constant current density (J) mode, 
employing the physical property measurement system (PPMS DynaCool, Quantum Design). The 
electrical terminals were fabricated using Ag paste. The ρ-T characteristics of Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystal were measured under a magnetic fields (H) parallel to the ab-plane and the c-axis 
with range of 0.1-9.0 T in the temperature range of 2.0-10.0 K.  
The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was 
estimated using the M-T and ρ-T characteristics. The superconductivity-onset temperature 
(Tc
onset) is defined as the temperature where the normal conducting state deviates from linear 
behavior in the ρ-T characteristics. The zero-resistivity critical temperature (Tc
zero) is defined as 
the temperature at which resistivity is lower than 3 or 20 μΩcm (in the absence or presence of 
applied magnetic fields, respectively). We presumed that the difference in criteria for reaching 
zero resistivity was due to the magnetic resistance of the single crystal.  
We measured the angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) in flux liquid state under various 
magnetic fields (H) and calculated the superconducting anisotropy (γs) using the effective mass 
model.16-18

3. Results and discussion 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown under different conditions: temperature, time, fluxes. 
As a result, largest crystals were obtained by the optimized condition described in the 
experimental section.  
Figure 1 shows the typical SEM image of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystal, which is 
flat-shaped, approximately 500 μm in size and 10 μm thick. Using EDS and EPMA, the 
composition of the obtained single crystals was estimated to be approximately Sm1.04 ± 0.03O0.83 ± 
0.05F0.17 ± 0.05Bi0.97 ± 0.03S2.00. No K, Cl, or I were detected with a minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 
wt%. Figure 2 presents the XRD pattern of the well-developed plane of the obtained single 
crystals. The diffraction peaks were identified to be the (00l) peaks of the ROBiS2 structure, and 
the ab-plane was well-developed.11 The c-axis lattice constant of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals was determined to be 13.38(4) Å. In order to confirm crystal structure and 
evaluate the lattice parameters parallel to ab-plane, SPXRD were used for crushed (powdered) 
single crystals. Even though the intensities of the observed peaks were low, owing to the small 
amount of crushed single crystals, the peaks at 3.415, 2.805, 2.152 1.984, and 1.715 Å were 
detected, and were indexed as the (102), (110), (114), (220), and (212) diffraction peaks of 
tetragonal structures, respectively. The lattice constants were calculated to be a = 3.9672(4) Å 
and c = 13.417(6) Å, and the obtained c-axis lattice constant value was in good agreement with 
that measured using the XRD pattern of the well-developed plane of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystal (Fig. 2). These lattice constants (a = 3.9672(4) Å and c = 13.417(6) Å) of the grown 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were shorter than those of Sm(O,F)BiS2 reported in a previous 
paper (a = 4.018(1) Å and c = 13.534(3) Å).9 The smaller c-axis lattice constant could be 


 
7
attributed to the higher F concentration,2,15,19 which would have triggered the superconducting 
properties described below.  
Figure 3 depicts the 4πχ-T characteristic of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals, which suggests the 
occurrence of the Meissner effect. Furthermore, Tc was estimated to be approximately 4.8 K. The 
superconducting transition was broad, which can be explained by possible inhomogeneous F 
distribution. The shielding volume fraction (4πχ) at approximately 2.5 K estimated from ZFC 
was more than one, which can be attributed to demagnetization coefficients.20 The direction of 
applied magnetic field for the susceptibility measurement was perpendicularity to the well-
developed plane of a plate crystal. Hence, the demagnetization coefficient perpendicular to the 
plane becomes close to 1, and then the superconducting volume fraction based on susceptibility 
would be overestimated. We tried to synthesize SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 poly-crystalline sample by 
heating the same starting material at 700 °C for 10 h without KI-KCl flux. However, XRD 
pattern of the product shows multiple phases and no diamagnetic signal down to 3 K by vibrating 
sample magnetometer (VSM).   
Figure 4 illustrates the ρ-T characteristic along the ab-plane of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystal. 
The Tc
onset and Tc
zero values were 5.45 and 3.91 K, respectively. The Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals 
exhibited metallic behavior along the ab-plane in normal state. However, Thakur et al.9 reported 
that Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals did not present superconducting transition or semiconducting 
behavior until the temperature reached 2 K. The reason is not very clear, but this can be 
attributed to the concentration of F of the reported sample being lower than that of the single 
crystal samples obtained in this study. Flux growth could slightly change the crystal structure as 
well as superconducting properties.21 It should be noted that Tc of R(O,F)BiS2 superconductors 


 
8
increased as the ionic radius of R3+ decreased,7,8 and the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals 
matched that trend.  
The ρ-T relationship below 10 K under magnetic fields (H) of 0.1-9.0 T, which were parallel to 
the ab-plane (H // ab-plane) and c-axis (H // c-axis) are presented in Figs. 5(a) and (b), 
respectively. The suppression of Tc under the effect of H // c-axis was more significant than that 
attributed to the H // ab-plane. This suggested that the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals presented 
high anisotropy. Both Tc
onset and Tc
zero were estimated from Fig. 5, and the field dependences of 
Tc
onset and Tc
zero under the effects of the H // ab-plane and H // c-axis are plotted in Fig. 6. From 
the linear extrapolations of the Tc
onset data, the upper critical field values, H//ab
C2 and H//c
C2, were 
predicted to be 29 and 1.1 T, respectively. On the other hand, using linear fitting to Tc
zero, the 
irreversibility fields H//ab
irr and H//c
irr were predicted to be 1.0 and 0.42 T, respectively. 
Furthermore, γs was calculated to be 26 using the upper critical fields according to Eq. (1):  
γs = H//ab
C2/H//c
C2.            (1) 
In addition, γs of the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystal was evaluated using the effective mass 
model.16 The angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) was measured at various magnetic fields 
(H) values in the flux (vertices) liquid state to estimate γs of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystal, as reported by Iye et al.17 and Iwasaki et al..18 The reduced field (Hred) was evaluated 
using Eq. (2) for the effective mass model: 
Hred = H(sin2θ + γs
-2cos2θ)1/2,          (2) 
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and magnetic field.16 The γs value was estimated using 
the best scaling of the graph illustrating the ρ-Hred relationship. Figure 7(a) depicts the angular 
(θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) at various magnetic fields (H = 0.1-9.0 T) in flux liquid state for 


 
9
the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystal. The ρ-θ curve presented almost two-fold symmetry. 
The ρ-Hred scaling obtained from Fig. 7(a) using Eq. (2) is presented in Fig. 7(b). The best 
scaling was obtained for γs = 10, as illustrated in Fig. 7(b). However, this plot deviates from the 
scaling at higher magnetic fields. Therefore, using the upper critical field and Eq. (1) we 
suggested that γs of Sm1.04 ± 0.03O0.83 ± 0.05F0.17 ± 0.05Bi0.97 ± 0.03S2.00 single crystals was 26. The γs 
values exhibit the difference between Eqs. (1) and (2). However, that reason is still unclear. 
Further research is required, and investigating Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals featuring various F 
amounts might reveal the origin of this difference.  
 
4. Conclusion 
We successfully grew superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals using KI-KCl flux. The 
shape of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was flat, the crystals were approximately 500 
μm in size and 10 μm thick, and their ab-plane was well-developed. The composition of the 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was Sm1.04 ± 0.03O0.83 ± 0.05F0.17 ± 0.05Bi0.97 ± 0.03S2.00, and the lattice 
constants were a = 3.9672(4) Å and c = 13.417(6) Å. The c-axis lattice constant value was 
smaller than that of non-superconducting Sm(O,F)BiS2,9 which suggested that the obtained 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals presented high F concentration. Superconducting transition was 
observed at approximately 4.8 K, which has not reported.9 The γs value of the obtained 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was evaluated to be 26 using upper critical field values.
