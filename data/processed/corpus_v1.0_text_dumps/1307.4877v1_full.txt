In this communication, we report the temperature dependence (3 – 300K) of the electrical 
resistivity of BiS2 based layered PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor at ambient and hydrostatic 
pressure of up to ~ 3GPa. Superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is marked by zero 
resistivity regions and also from the derivative of resistivity with respect to temperature plots. It 
is observed that Tc increases with pressure (< 2GPa) at the rate of dTc/dP= 0.45 K/GPa for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. The values of electron’s scattering factor (A) and residual resistivity 
(ρ0) are determined from the ρ(T)= ρ0+AT2 relation, while factor A is increased, the 
corresponding ρ0 is decreased with application of pressure. This indicates presence of substantial 
electron correlation effect in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 under external hydrostatic pressure.  Higher pressure 
(> 2GPa) studies are warranted to observe the saturation or decrease of Tc in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconductor. It is envisaged that one may increase the Superconducting transition temperature 
(Tc) of recently discovered PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor by applying hydrostatic external or 
internal chemical pressure via suitable on site substitutions.

Introduction 
Since the discovery of high-transition temperature (HTSc) superconductivity in layered 
copper oxides in excess of above 130K, lot of efforts have been put by both experimentalists and 
theoreticians to understand the mysterious phenomenon.  Later in year 2008, the Fe based oxy-
pnictides, i.e., LnFePnO (Ln= La, Pr, Ce, Nd, Sm; Pn: P and As) with a ZrCuSiAs type structure 
[1,2] exhibited superconductivity in excess of 50K [3,4]. The LnFePnO attracted much attention 
due to their parent phase being of semi-metallic nature and including a strong ferromagnetic (Fe) 
atom in the conduction layer instead of Cu in CuO layer of cuprate superconductors. The 
maximum superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 26 K was found at ambient pressure in 
Fe-based LaFeAsO1-xFx (x = 0.05-0.12) superconductor [3], which increases to 56 K by doping 
of Sm in the place of La [4]. Further, the application of external pressure enhanced the Tc of 
LaFeAsO/F from 26 K to 43 K at the pressure range of 4 GPa. These results have enabled 
materials scientist’s to explore new materials with possible higher Tc and think of 
superconducting runway mechanisms by using chemical doping, high magnetic field and 
external pressure. Besides the cuprates and Fe oxy-pnictides, more recently a BiS2 based layered 
Bi4O4S3 superconductor has appeared with Tc of 4K at ambient pressure [5, 6].  Soon after, 
another BiS2 based series i.e., REOBiS2 (RE = La, Pr, Nd and Ce) was reported with Tc in excess 
of 5 K [7-11]. Interestingly the structure of REOBiS2 is similar to that of LnFePnO pnictides. 
Mizuguchi et al. reported the onset Tc of 8.7K for high pressure synthesized Bi4O4S3 [12].  Later, 
in case of LaO1-xFxBiS2  (x = 0.5) maximum Tc of 10.5 K was attained through  high pressure 
and high temperature sintering method using cubic-anvil cell under applied pressure of 2 GPa 
[13].  
 
 The superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE=rare earth elements) is achieved through 
carrier doping (O/F). The spacer layer (REO) is used as charge reservoir similar to that as in case 
of Fe pnictides. The effect of external pressure on these new BiS2-based superconducting 
systems has not been fully investigated yet. The band structure calculations of BiS2 based 
superconductors show that the Fermi level with corresponding density of states are mainly 
originated from Bi (6P) orbitals [14]. The superconductivity in BiS2- based Bi4O4S3 and 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds is attributed to the rate of flow of carriers between insulating and 
conducting layers, which is strikingly similar to that as for high-Tc cuprate and Fe-pnictide

superconductors. Kotegawa et al. reported that the Tc of Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconductors were found to decreases at maximum pressure of (~ 1.9 GPa) due to instability 
in the Fermi surface resulting in band disorderedness appeared in these compounds [13]. Under 
external pressure effect, the rare earth BiS2-based superconductor with Nd (4f) atom moves 
further close to the Fermi level, and make more stronger hybridization between Nd (4f) and Bi 
(6P) atomic orbitals than the normal state in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 [15].   
 
As of  yet, superconductivity found in various strongly correlated electronic systems had 
been related to quantum critical transitions (QCT) where the perfect tuning of QCP’s have been 
taken with respect to chemical elements, magnetic field and external pressure [16-19]. In 
addition, to compare with chemical doping and magnetic field, the external pressure is one of the 
clean ways for altering atomic lattice without introducing impurities and thus to moderate the 
electronic band structure. Likewise, the electronic structure of recently discovered Bismuth 
oxysulfide superconductors could be changed by addition of chemical elements over the 
conducting layer as well as by applying external hydrostatic pressure.  In this report, here we 
have studied and investigated an effect of external hydrostatic pressure (P) on the electrical 
resistivity () and Tc of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 in the temperature ranges from 300 to 3.5K.  
Experimental Methods 
 
The polycrystalline samples PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 was synthesised by a two step solid state 
reaction method. The detailed study of sample preparation techniques, structural and magnetic 
properties were previously reported Jha et al. [10]. The normalised (dc) electrical resistivity 
measurements under pressure are carried out on a Closed Cycle Refrigerator- Variable 
Temperature Insert (CCR-VTI) in temperature ranges of 300- 3.5K by standard four probe 
technique. The external hydrostatic pressure up to ~ 3GPa was generated by homemade self-
clamp type hybrid pressure cell in which outer jacket and inner core was made by BeCu and 
NiCrAl materials. The Daphene 7373 was used as a hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium 
and applied pressure inside the cell was calibrated using structural change of bismuth (Bi) with 
fixed pressure point method at room temperature. For conventional four probe method, the four 
contacts are made by copper wire with diameter of 0.15 mm and high quality silver paste was 
taken for sample with copper wire connections. The polycrystalline samples used in these 
experiments had dimensions of nearly 1.0×0.8×0.4 mm3.

Results and discussion 
 
Figure (1) shows the room temperature Rietveld fitted XRD pattern of as synthesized 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern is carried out by using the 
Wyckoff positions of Bismuth (Bi), Praseodymium (Pr), and Sulfur (S1 and S2) atoms occupy 
the 2c (0.25, 0.25, z) site. On the other hand, O/F atoms are at 2a (0.75, 0.25, 0) site. The 
compound is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group structure. A small amount of Bi2S3 
impurity is also observed along with the main phase. The refined lattice parameters are a = 
4.015(5) Å, c = 13.362(4) Å. Inset of the figure (1) is showing the  AC magnetic susceptibility 
result in an applied field of 5 Oe in temperature range of 2–7K. The compound exhibits sharp 
diamagnetic transition at around 3.7K.  
Figure 2 depicts the temperature dependence of dc electrical resistivity (ρ) taken from 
150K to 3.5K for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor at ambient and different externally applied 
hydrostatic pressures of up to 3GPa. The onset of transition temperature (Tc
onset) under zero 
applied field is seen at 3.7K; being marked by the intersection of two extrapolated lines drawn on 
the normal resistivity curves as shown in the inset of figures (2). The dc resistivity gradually 
increases as a function of temperature down to 5K, which is reminiscent of slight 
semiconducting behaviour, and thereafter a sharp drop to Tc(ρ=0) can be seen at 3.5K for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. The normal state resistivity behaviour of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample in zero 
applied field is similar to that of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Nd) superconductors [8,9]. In order to 
understand a clear change of Tc by temperature, we have marked three different Tc as Tc
onset, Tc
mid 
and Tc
offset, these are marked the insert of figure 2. The onset Tc is determined from the 
intersection of the two extrapolated lines; one is drawn through the resistivity curve in the 
normal state just above Tc, and the other is drawn through the steepest part of the resistivity 
curve in the superconducting state. The midpoint Tc is determined at the temperature where the 
resistivity is dropped by 50% of its value at the onset Tc and the offset Tc is marked by Tc(ρ=0), 
i.e., zero resistivity state. With application of hydrostatic pressure (0.43GPa to 2.19GPa) the 
normal state resistivity (150K-5K) becomes slightly metallic and the superconducting transition 
temperature Tc(ρ=0) is increased. The evolution of metallic behaviour under applied pressure is 
similar to that as observed very recently for (La/Ce)O0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors [20]. At room 
temperature all the rare earth doped REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Pr, Nd and Ce) has the value of 


 
5
resistivity 10-3Ω-m, which is close to the range of semiconducting materials observed from ρ vs 
T curve at ambient pressure [7-13]. The increase in Tc(ρ=0) of  PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample under 
hydrostatic pressure will be discussed in next section.     
 
Figure (3a) shows the superconducting transition part of the electrical resistivity of 
polycrystalline PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample at different externally applied hydrostatic pressures in the 
low temperature range of 3 to 7K. 
In our previous study, the external hydrostatic pressure 
enhanced the Tc from 4.6K to 5K (1.31 GPa) for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and upon further increase in 
pressure, the same decreased to 4.8K [15].  In present case for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, the enhancement 
of Tc(ρ=0) is seen from 3.7K to 4.7K with change in pressure from 0 to 2.19 GPa. The mid point 
of Tc could be seen clearly from the dρ/dT peak being shown in Figure 3(b). It is clear from 
Figure 3(b) that bulk Tc of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound increases monotonically with pressure up to 
2.19 GPa. Simultaneously the normal state (near Tc onset) resistivity is suppressed from 1.6m Ω-
cm to 0.55m Ω-cm with application of hydrostatic pressure; see Figure 3(a).  The rate of Tc 
increases under external pressure is calculated to be 0.45K/GPa for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound.  It 
is clear that with in applied pressure range of up to 2.19GPa the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound reveals 
a positive pressure coefficient, which denotes an increase in density of charge carriers at Fermi 
surface under applied pressure. Kotegawa et al [13] reported stable electronic band structure with 
high density of states for these new BiS2-based superconductors (Bi4O4S3 and LnO0.5F0.5BiS2) 
and located them at the boundary between semiconducting and metallic states. Interestingly, Tc 
increases monotonically for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 for hydrostatic pressure up to 2.19 GPa, along with 
emergence of nearly metallic behaviour with positive d/dT.          
 
The figure 4 (a) shows the pressure dependent of superconducting transition (Tc) and the 
superconducting transition width (ΔTc = Tc
onset - Tc
offset) for the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. 
Superconducting transition Tc is increased from 3.7K to 4.7K and the transition width (ΔTc) is 
also increased slightly from 0.21K to 0.50K. This means the superconducting transition is 
slightly broadened under hydrostatic pressure for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. This is in agreement 
with earlier reports on similar compounds [12,13,15,20].  The relation between normal state 
resistivity, residual resistivity (ρ0) and electron-electron scattering factor (A) can be derived from 
ρ(T)= ρ0+AT2. The values of ρ0 and A at ambient and different hydrostatic pressure was 
calculated and plotted in figure 4 (b). The parameter A is increased from 1 x 10-6 Ω-cmK-2 to 


 
6
1.28 x 10-6 Ω-cmK-2 (2.19 GPa). At the same time the value of residual resistivity ρ0 is decreased 
from 1.56×10-4 Ω-cm to 6.12×10-5 Ω-cm with increase in pressure up to 2.19GPa. 
To consider some postulates involving the relation between ρ0 and A at particular 
pressure level of up to ~ 2.19 GPa, the Tc increases and ρ0 is decreased. Also, the change of ρ0 
and electron scattering factor (A) seems to be distinguishable with respect to Pr3+(4f) and 
Bi3+(6p) hybridizations with electron correlation effect in the conducting layers at ambient and 
external hydrostatic pressure. There is also a possibility of change of valance (3+ to 44+) in Pr at 
high pressure (2 GPa), which could enhance the conducting carrier interaction and reduce the 
rate of scattered electrons.  More likely scenario could be the changed interactions between PrO 
insulating and 6p (BiS2) conducting layers with applied pressure. The two layers (PrO/F and 
BiS2) act in different manners at Fermi surface. In order to understand the relation between 
effective electron correlation effect and change of Tc for these compounds, detailed theoretical 
studies of band structure and structural parameters under high pressure are strictly needed. 
 
Conclusion 
In summary, we have investigated the electrical resistivity under external hydrostatic 
pressures of up to 2.19GPa for BiS2-based polycrystalline PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 layered superconductor. 
The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is monotonically enhanced 
from 3.7 to 4.7K (2.19GPa). The positive pressure coefficient of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors 
denotes the possibility of a strong inherent carrier interaction on DOS at N(EF) under pressure. 
An observed decreasing of electron correlation effect from the values of electron-electron 
scattering factor (A) and residual resistivity (ρ0) seems noticeable which may occur due to 
unusual change of hybridization of Pr3+(4f) and Bi3+(6p) on the spacer and conducting layers 
under external hydrostatic pressure. Furthermore studies are required on both theoretical side and 
experimental high pressure investigations on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor.
