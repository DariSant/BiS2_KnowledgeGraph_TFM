Abstract 
We investigate the superconducting properties and possible nematic superconductivity of self-
doped BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductor CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 through the measurements of 
in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance. Single crystals of CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 were grown using 
a flux method. Single-crystal structural analysis revealed that the crystal structure at room 
temperature is tetragonal (P4/nmm). Bulk superconductivity with a transition temperature of 
3.3 K was observed through electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements. 
Investigation of anisotropy of upper critical field suggested relatively low anisotropy in the 
crystal as compared to other BiCh2-based superconductors. In the superconducting states of 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3, two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance was observed, 
which indicates the in-plane rotational symmetry breaking in the tetragonal structure and hence 
the possibility of nematic superconductivity in CeOBiS1.7Se0.3.

1. Introduction 
Recently, nematic superconductivity (NSC), which is typically characterized by 
spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the amplitude of the superconducting gap, has 
been observed in superconducting states of a topological superconductor system AxBi2Se3 (A = 
Cu, Sr, Nb).[1-7] Although AxBi2Se3 has a trigonal structure, the observed in-plane anisotropy of 
superconducting properties in those superconductors exhibit two-fold symmetry. This behavior 
indicates rotational symmetry breaking in the superconducting states and is called NSC. Since 
the system which shows NSC is limited, new system which shows NSC has been desired to 
obtain further knowledge about the emergence of NSC states in layered materials. 
Very recently, in single crystals of LaO1-xFxBiSSe (x = 0.1 and 0.5), which are BiCh2-
based layered superconductors (Ch: S, Se),[8-10] two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of c-
axis magnetoresistance (MR) was observed in the superconducting states,[11,12] while those 
phases have tetragonal symmetry.[13] Those experimental results proposed BiCh2-based 
superconductors to be a new platform to study NSC. Since both samples with different electron 
doping concentration (x = 0.1 and 0.5) exhibit NSC, Fermi surface topology seems not 
essentially affect the emergence/disappearance of NSC in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. However, in another 
BiCh2-based superconductor, NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, no features of NSC were observed in its 
superconducting states; MR in the superconducting states exhibited four-fold-symmetric in-
plane anisotropy.[14] Therefore, we need to clarify the factor, which is essential for the 
emergence/disappearance (switching) of NSC in BiCh2-based systems. For that purpose, 
comparison of properties of phases with different in-plane chemical pressure (CP) should be 
important.[15] Generally, superconducting properties of BiCh2-based systems are explained by 
in-plane CP because their superconducting properties are strongly affected by the in-plane local 
disorder, which locally lowers in-plane structural symmetry of the Bi-Ch1 network (see Figure 
1(b) for the definition of the Ch1 site).[15-20] With this respect, LaO1-xFxBiSSe possesses quite 
high in-plane CP because of nearly 100% occupancy of Se at the in-plane Ch1 site. For

Nd(O,F)BiS2, in-plane CP is lower than that for LaO1-xFxBiSSe,[15] while it is higher than other 
RE(O,F)BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, and Pr and hence shows bulk superconductivity. Therefore, 
there is possible scenario that the presence of weak local structural disorder suppresses the NSC 
states in BiCh2-based systems. Hence, we need further example of BiCh2-based 
superconductors, which shows NSC for clarifying the scenario above. 
This study is focused on the CeOBiS2-xSex system. Bulk superconductivity was 
observed in polycrystalline samples with x = 0.4 and 0.6 of CeOBiS2-xSex, and its Tc was ~3 
K.[21] The crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of a CeO blocking layer and a BiCh2 
conducting layer. Notably, external elemental substitution is not needed to generate electron 
carriers in BiCh2 layers because carriers are self-doped via the mixed valence states of Ce.[21,22] 
This situation is clearly different from the cases of other RE(O,F)BiCh2 systems, in which 
elemental substitutions are needed to dope electrons.[9,10] In addition, Se concentration in Bi-
Ch1 conducting plane is significantly lower than LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Hence, there are clear 
compositional differences in both blocking and conducting layers between LaO1-xFxBiSSe (x = 
0.1 and 0.5), NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, and CeOBiS2-xSex. In this study, we have investigated the in-plane 
anisotropy of MR in the superconducting states of CeOBiS2-xSex (x = 0.3) and observed NSC 
features. 
 
2. Experimental details 
CeOBiS2-xSex single crystals were grown by using a high-temperature flux method in 
an evacuated quartz tube. Polycrystalline powders of CeOBiS1.6Se0.4 were prepared by the 
solid-state-reaction method as described in Ref. 21. The mixture of the polycrystalline powders 
of CeOBiS1.6Se0.4 (~0.5 g) and CsCl flux (~3.8 g) with a molar ratio of 1:20 was mixed and 
then sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was heated at 950 °C for 15 h and slowly 
cooled to 650 °C at a rate of −2.0 °C/h, which was followed by furnace cooling to room 


 
 
4 
 
temperature. After the heat treatment, the quartz tube was opened under the air atmosphere, and 
the product was filtered and washed with pure water. 
The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction method (XRD) with a 
Cu-Kα radiation on a Miniflex-600 (Rigaku) by the θ–2θ method. The single crystals were 
analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and their chemical composition was 
investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). Single crystal X-ray structural 
analysis was carried out at room temperature on a XtaLAB (Rigaku). The structural parameters 
were refined with the tetragonal (P4/nmm) structural model using the refinement program 
SHELXL.[23] A crystal structure image was depicted using a VESTA software.[24] 
Electrical resistivity was measured by an in-plane four-terminal configuration. The 
terminals were fabricated using Au wire (25 μm) and Ag paste. In-plane anisotropy was 
investigated on a PPMS with a horizontal rotator (Quantum Design) and a sample holder for 
in-plane anisotropy measurements. The temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was 
measured by a superconducting interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field 
10 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) on a MPMS3 (Quantum Design). 
 
3. Results and discussion 
As shown in the inset of Figure 1(a), plate-like crystals were obtained. To confirm the 
c-axis direction of the obtained sample, powder XRD was performed on the CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 
single crystals; the plates of the crystal were loaded on a sample plate. As shown in Fig. 1(a), 
00l peaks were solely observed, which confirms that the ab-plane is well developed. The 
average ratio of the constituent elements (except for O) was estimated to be Ce : Bi : S : Se = 
1 : 1.00(1) : 1.74(2) : 0.30(1), where the Ce value was fixed to 1 for normalization. Considering 
the error in the EDX analysis, we concluded that the chemical composition of the single crystals 
is close to the nominal composition, and hence the sample was called CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 in this 
paper.

of CeOBiS1.7Se0.3. Ch1 and Ch2 denote the in-plane and out-of-plane chalcogen sites, 
respectively. 
 
Single crystal X-ray structural analysis on a CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 crystal was performed. 
Details of the analysis condition and the refined structural parameters are summarized in Tables 
I and II. Since the Se ions selectively occupy the in-plane Ch1 site,[25] Se occupation ratio for 
Ch2 site fixed to 0. The ratio of S and Se is consistent with the EDX analysis result. The 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystal crystallizes in a tetragonal space group P4/nmm and has lattice 
parameters of a = 4.0327(9) Å and c = 13.603(4) Å, which agrees with a report on 
polycrystalline samples.[21] As demonstrated in Ref. 26, the bond valence sum for Ce site was 
calculated using the following parameters: b0 = 0.37 Å, R0 = 2.151 Å for Ce–O bond, 2.62 Å 
for Ce–S bond, and 2.74 Å for Ce–Se bond. Bond distances between Ce and nine coordinating 
anions were determined by single crystal X-ray structural analysis. Site occupancies at the 


 
 
6 
 
chalcogen site were included in the calculation. The estimated valence of Ce is 3.25, which is 
consistent with the value for the polycrystal and indicates that Ce has the mixed valence state.[21] 
Hence, the phase is a self-doped system with mixed-valence Ce. 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for a 
CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystal measured with a current along the (a) ab-plane (ρab) and (b) c-axis 
(ρc). The onset temperature (Tconset) and zero-resistivity temperature (Tczero) were determined to 
be 3.6 K and 3.3 K, respectively. The Tczero values are slightly higher than those observed for 
polycrystalline samples of CeOBiS2-xSex.[21] In the normal states, ρc is clearly higher than ρab, 
which is due to the structure composed of stacking of electrically conductive BiCh2 layers and 
insulating layers along the c-axis. Similar behavior has been observed in various layered 
superconductor, such as a Cu oxide Bi2Sr2CuOx,[27] an Fe pnictide BaFe2As2,[28] and BiCh2-
based compounds.[29]

Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of the magnetization after ZFC and FC 
with an applied field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis for CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystal. A large 
diamagnetic signal corresponding to superconductivity was observed, indicating that the 
observed superconducting states are bulk in nature, as reported in polycrystalline samples.[21] 
Tc was estimated to be 3.3 K, which is consistent with the zero resistivity states in the ρ-T data. 
Figure 4(a) shows a schematic image of the rotation angles for magnetoresistance 
measurements. Figure 4(b) shows the θ dependence of ρab at various magnetic fields of 0.3–
2.0 T. Anisotropy was clearly observed, which is typical trend for layered superconductors. 
Figure 4(c) shows the θ dependence of ρab at B = 1.0 T and T = 2.1 K. The minimum of ρab 


 
 
10 
 
was observed at θ = 98°, in which the magnetic field is applied parallel to the ab-plane. 
Therefore, we defined that the magnetic field are parallel to the ab-plane when θ = 98°. 
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of ρab under various magnetic fields of (a) 
B//ab and (b) B//c. Tc decreases with increasing magnetic field in both directions. The 
suppression of Tc under magnetic field parallel to the c-axis is more significant than that under 
magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane. An upper critical field (Bc2)-temperature phase diagram 
is shown in Fig. 5(c), in which a temperature where the resistivity becomes 90% of the normal-
state value under various applied magnetic fields. We calculated Bc2(0) for B//ab and B//c using 
the conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model for type-II 
superconductors in a dirty limit,[30] which gives Bc2(0) = -0.693Tc(dBc2/dT)T=Tc. The Bc2(0) 
values for B//ab and B//c were estimated to be Bc2//ab (0) = 3.3 T and Bc2//c (0) = 0.46 T, 
respectively. The anisotropic parameter for Bc2,  = Bc2//ab (0)/ Bc2//c (0), is determined to be 7.3. 
This value is comparably lower than that of other BiCh2-based superconductors.[29] Since the 
anisotropy parameter depends on its fluorine concentration in the case of RE(O,F)BiS2 with RE 
= La, Ce, Pr and Nd,[39, 31] the lack of fluorine may affect the  in BiCh2-based systems. It is 
worth noting that,  was estimated to be 30–60 when RE = La, Pr, and Nd; the value of  was 
especially high for Pr(O,F)BiS2, while it was estimated to 13–21 for Ce(O,F)BiS2.[30, 31]

of upper critical field Bc2(T) for a CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystal. The values estimated from the

Figure 6(a) shows the  dependences of the ρab at B = 0.5 T and at various temperatures 
ranging 2.4–8.0 K. Below 3.0 K, the  dependence of the ρab shows two-fold-symmetric in-
plane anisotropy. This trend is not expected from a tetragonal structural symmetry: four-fold 
symmetry in a tetragonal ab plane. The structural-symmetry breaking in the superconducting 
states is a trend of NSC, which has been observed in LaO1-xFxBiSSe.[11,12] Above 4.0 K, the ρab 
is independent of , which suggests that the observed two-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance 
appears in superconducting states only. To investigate the reproducibility and the affection of 


 
 
12 
 
the magnitude of magnetic fields for the observed two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy, we 
performed the in-plane anisotropy measurement under various magnetic fields in a different 
sample. Figure 6(b) shows the  dependences of ρab for at T = 2.1 K and various magnetic field 
in the range 0.50–2.0 T. At 0.9 T,  dependences of ρab shows uplifts around  = 45° and 225°, 
indicating two-fold symmetry of the in-plane anisotropy of ρab. At 1.0 T, clear two-fold 
symmetry of ρab was observed. With increasing magnetic field, superconductivity was 
suppressed and two-fold symmetry of ρab also disappeared. Therefore, the NSC-like feature 
does not depend on the magnitude of magnetic field.

resistivity (ρab) for a CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystal at T = 2.1 K and at various magnetic fields

As introduced in the introduction, in-plane chemical pressure (CP) is a factor possibly 
essential for the emergence/disappearance (switching) of NSC in BiCh2-based systems. This 
factor suppresses the weak local structural disorder peculiar to BiCh2-based systems. Therefore, 
it is motivated to investigate in-plane local structure and in-plane anisotropy in another BiCh2-


 
 
13 
 
based systems. The discovery of new NSC phase of BiCh2-based superconductor shown in this 
study will be useful to address the issue. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have synthesized CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 single crystals using a flux method. The single 
crystal X-ray structural analysis revealed that the crystal has a tetragonal structure with the 
space group of P4/nmm. BVS calculations showed that the valence of Ce ions is 3.25, indicating 
the mixed-valence state of Ce. Bulk superconductivity with a transition temperature of 3.3 K 
was confirmed through the electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements. The 
estimation of anisotropy parameter γ of Bc2 revealed that the γ for CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 is lower than 
that observed for RE(O,F)BiS2 crystals. In the in-plane anisotropy measurements, two-fold 
symmetric in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states was 
observed. These results suggest that CeOBiS1.7Se0.3 is a new nematic superconductor.
