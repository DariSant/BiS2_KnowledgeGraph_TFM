Abstract 
PrOBiS2 single crystals were successfully grown using a KCl flux. The obtained 
crystals had a plate-like shape with a typical size of 0.5–1.0 mm and well-developed 
ab-plane. The Pr valence of the grown crystals, as determined by an X-ray absorption 
fine structure spectroscopy analysis, was almost trivalent. The PrOBiS2 single crystals 
did not exhibit superconductivity down to 0.25 K. The transport properties under high 
pressures up to 50 GPa ensured semiconducting behavior for 2–300 K using a diamond 
anvil cell.

Main text 
1. Introduction 
The superconductivity of ROBiS2 (R: rare earth elements) have been intensively 
studied [1-5]. Superconductivity is triggered by carrier doping, which can be induced by 
anion doping, by substituting F at the O site. However, CeOBiS2 without F-doping 
exhibits superconductivity due to the valence fluctuation between Ce3+ and Ce4+ [6,7]. 
F-free ROBiS2 compounds are important for understanding the superconductivity 
mechanism; it is important to know the properties of the mother compounds even 
without superconductivity. The crystal growth of F-free ROBiS2 with R=La, Ce, and 
(Ce0.5Pr0.5) have been reported previously [6-10]. However, F-free PrOBiS2 single 
crystals have not been grown. Additionally, the superconductivity of F-free BiS2-based 
materials is enhanced under high pressure [8].  
In this paper, we successfully grew F-free PrOBiS2 single crystals using a KCl flux. 
The obtained single crystals of PrOBiS2 were characterized by X-ray absorption fine 
structure spectroscopy for the Pr valence, and the electrical transport properties down to 
0.25 K, under high pressures up to 50 GPa.  
 
2. Experimental 


 
4
The PrOBiS2 single crystals were grown by a high-temperature flux method [11–13]. 
The raw materials; Pr2S3 (99.9 wt%), Bi2O3 (99.9 wt%), and Bi2S3 (99.9 wt%), were 
weighed for a nominal composition of PrOBiS2. The mixture of the raw materials (0.8 
g) and KCl (99.5 wt%) flux (5.0 g) were ground using a mortar, and then sealed into an 
evacuated quartz tube. The quartz tube was heated at 1050 °C for 10 h, followed by 
cooling to 750 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h. The sample was then cooled to room temperature 
in the furnace. The resulting quartz tube was opened in air, and the obtained materials 
were washed and filtered by distilled water to remove the KCl flux.  
The compositional ratio of the single crystals was evaluated by energy dispersive 
X-ray spectrometry (EDS) (Bruker, Quantax 70) associated with the observation of the 
microstructure 
using 
a 
scanning 
electron 
microscope 
(SEM) 
(Hitachi 
High-Technologies, TM3030). The obtained compositional values were normalized 
using S = 2.00, with the Pr, O, and Bi values measured to a precision of two decimal 
places. The identification and orientation of the grown crystals were performed by 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) using Rigaku MultiFlex with CuKα radiation. The valence 
state of the Praseodymium component in the grown crystals was estimated by an X-ray 
absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy analysis with an Aichi XAS beamline 
and synchrotron X-ray radiation (BL11S2: Experimental No.201801025). For the XAFS 


 
5
spectroscopy sample, the obtained single crystals were grinded and mixed with boron 
nitride (BN) powder, and pressed into a pellet with a 4 mm diameter and total weight of 
approximately 31 mg.  
The resistivity–temperature (ρ–T) characteristics were measured by the standard 
four-probe method with a constant current density (J) mode and a physical property 
measurement system (Quantum Design; PPMS DynaCool). The electrical terminals 
were fabricated by Ag paste. The ρ–T characteristics in the temperature range 0.25–15 
K were measured with an adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) option for 
PPMS. The magnetic field for the operation of the ADR, 3 T at 1.9 K, was applied; and 
subsequently removed. The temperature of the sample consequently decreased to 
approximately 0.25 K. The measurement of the ρ–T characteristics was started at the 
lowest temperature (~0.25 K), which was spontaneously increased to approximately 15 
K. The resistance under high pressure in the temperature range 2–300 K was measured 
by the four-probe method using a diamond anvil cell (DAC) with boron-doped diamond 
electrodes [14–16] on the bottom anvil of the nanopolycrystalline diamond [17]. Each 
electrode was at a distance of 5 µm with a 200 nm thickness. The plate-shaped crystal 
settled on the bottom, and therefore the resistance parallel to the flat-plane was 
measured. The cubic boron nitride powders with a ruby manometer were used as the 


 
6
pressure-transmitting medium. The applied pressure values were estimated by the 
fluorescence from the ruby powders [18]. The Raman spectrum from the culet on the 
top diamond anvil [19] was measured by an inVia Raman Microscope (RENISHAW). 
The resistance–temperature (R–T) characteristics with a constant current (I) mode under 
high pressure were measured by a physical property measurement system (Quantum 
Design: PPMS) with the DAC equipment.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of the PrOBiS2 single crystal. The obtained 
single crystals had plate-like shapes with sizes and thickness in the ranges 0.5–1.0 mm 
and 10–30 µm, respectively. The estimated atomic ratio of the obtained single crystals 
was Pr:O:Bi:S=1.03:0.96:0.99:2.00, which agreed with the nearly stoichiometric ratio. 
On the other hand, K and Cl from the flux were not detected in the single crystals with a 
minimum sensitivity limit of approximately 1 wt%.  
Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of a well-developed plane in the single crystals. The 
presence of only the 00l diffraction peaks, similar to F-doped PrOBiS2 compound 
structures [13] , indicated a well-developed ab-plane. The c-axis lattice constant was 
approximately 13.78(3) Å.

Figure 3 shows Pr L3-edge absorption spectra of the PrOBiS2 single crystals using an 
XAFS spectroscopy analysis at room temperature. The Pr L3-edge of the PrOBiS2 single 
crystals exhibited a peak at approximately 5968 eV, which was assigned to Pr3+. This is 
consistent with the other XAFS spectroscopy results for the trivalent electronic 
configuration (Pr3+) [20,21]. On the other hand, the peak position of the tetravalent 
electronic configuration (Pr4+) is approximately 5979 eV, which was assigned to Pr6O11 
[20,22]. We analyzed the Pr valence state in the PrOBiS2 single crystals using a linear 
combination fitting from the Pr2S3 and Pr6O11 XAFS spectroscopy spectra. The ratios of 
the compounds Pr2S3 (Pr3+) and Pr6O11 (one-third Pr3+ and two-thirds Pr4+) were 97 and 
3%, respectively. Thus, Pr4+/(Pr3++Pr4+) was estimated at 2%. Therefore, the trivalent 
electronic structure was a major contributor, with only a small amount of the tetravalent 
electronic configuration.  
Figure 4 shows the ρ–T characteristics parallel to the ab-plane for the PrOBiS2 single 
crystal. The electrical resistivity decreased with decreasing temperature, indicating 
metallic behavior in the range 50–300 K. In contrast, semiconducting behavior occurred 
below 50 K, and the reason for this is unclear. Further investigation is required to clarify 
the origin of this phenomenon. The ρ–T characteristics for the PrOBiS2 single crystal in 
the temperature range 0.25–15 K had a non-zero resistivity, indicating that there were 


 
8
no superconducting transitions down to 0.25 K. This result is consistent with 
poly-crystalline samples [6].  
An X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the F-doped PrOBiS2 
(PrO1-xFxBiS2: x = 0.13 and 0.23) single crystals showed that the Pr valence state was 
almost three [23]. This valence was close to that obtained for PrOBiS2, although the 
XAFS spectroscopy spectra suggested approximately 2% of Pr4+. Assuming that all of 
the detected F- and Pr4+ content contributed to the electron carrier, the carrier 
concentration was the lowest in PrOBiS2, higher in PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.13), and the 
highest in PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.23). The metallic conduction of all of the compounds can 
be explained by these electron carriers. The appearance of superconductivity in 
PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.13 and 0.23) can be understood by the high concentration of carrier 
doping from the high concentrations of F.  
Applying pressure is another approach to induce carriers and trigger 
superconductivity. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the resistance for the 
PrOBiS2 single crystal under various pressures from 1.7 to 50 GPa. The resistance 
continued to decrease with the increase of the applied pressure up to 45 GPa, before 
increasing under 50 GPa. Therefore, up to 50 GPa, the PrOBiS2 single crystal 
maintained semiconducting behavior under a high pressure and became neither metallic 


 
9
nor superconducting behaviors in the range 2–300 K. Even at 50 GPa, the carrier 
concentration induced by the high pressure would not sufficient to trigger 
superconductivity. This semiconducting behavior under applied pressures is inconsistent 
with the metallic behavior observed in the same crystal without an applied pressure (Fig. 
4). Although the reason for this is unknown, the non-hydrostatic pressure via DAC 
usually degrades the crystallinity of a sample, possibly resulting in mixed transport 
properties along the ab-plane and parallel to the c-axis due to the thickness of the 
boron-doped diamond electrodes.  
 
4. Conclusion 
F-free PrOBiS2 single crystals were successfully grown by a KCl flux. The XAFS 
spectroscopy analysis showed that the Pr chemical state had a small amount of 
tetravalent. The electrical resistivity of the PrOBiS2 single crystals exhibited metallic 
and semiconducting behaviors above and below 50 K, respectively. The resistance with 
an applied pressure showed semiconducting behavior in the range 2–300 K. No 
superconductivity in the PrOBiS2 single crystals was observed down to 0.25 K, or under 
high pressure up to 50 GPa and down to 2 K.
