Abstract
We have synthesized a novel europium bismuth sulfoﬂuoride, Eu3Bi2S4F4, by solid-state
reactions in sealed evacuated quartz ampoules. The compound crystallizes in a tetragonal lat-
tice (space group I4/mmm, a = 4.0771(1) Å, c = 32.4330(6) Å, and Z = 2), in which CaF2-type
Eu3F4 layers and NaCl-like BiS2 bilayers stack alternately along the crystallographic c axis.
There are two crystallographically distinct Eu sites, Eu(1) and Eu(2) at the Wyckoff positions
4e and 2a, respectively. Our bond-valence-sum calculation, based on the reﬁned structural

data, indicates that Eu(1) is essentially divalent, whilst Eu(2) has an average valence of ∼
+2.64(5). This anomalous Eu valence state is further conﬁrmed and supported, respectively,
by Mössbauer and magnetization measurements. The Eu3+ components donate electrons into
the conduction bands that are mainly composed of Bi- 6px and 6py states. Consequently, the
material itself shows metallic conduction, and superconducts at 1.5 K without extrinsic chem-
ical doping.
Introduction
Exploration of new superconductors is an important and challenging work. Through long-term
effort, especially during the past three decades, one has learned two basic rational routes for new
superconducting materials. The ﬁrst one is to carry out chemical doping in a so-called parent
compound which is potentially superconducting. The other is to synthesize a new compound that
contains two-dimensional (2D) superconductively active layers via structural design.1–3 Promi-
nent examples are manifested by copper-based and iron-based high-temperature superconductors,
in which the superconductively active layers are 2D CuO2 planes and Fe2As2 layers, respectively.
Impressively, both the seminal discoveries were made by chemical doping,4,5 and all structures
of these high-temperature superconductors can be well elucidated in terms of their crystal chem-
istry.3,6 Optimizations of the doping level and the building block layers may create a record of
the superconducting transition temperature, Tc.7,8 It is noted here, nevertheless, superconductivity
may also appears, though infrequently or even rarely, in an apparently undoped material in which
charge carriers are induced by self doping through internal charge transfer.9,10
Recently, superconductivity up to 10.6 K was discovered in Bi4O4S3 11 and LaO1−xFxBiS2,12
in which the 2D BiS2 bilayers were identiﬁed as superconductively active layers.
Thus, the
BiS2-based material represents a new class of superconductors, though the superconducting phase
in the Bi-O-S system is not well established due to the complicated stacking faults.13–15 The
LaBiS2O1−xFx (hereafter abbreviated as La-1121)16 system has been extended into a supercon-
ducting family whose new members appeared one after another via element replacements in the
2


La2O2 spacer layers17–22 or even in the BiS2 bilayers.23 As a matter of fact, the relevant work can
be traced back earlier to 1970s when the crystal structure of CeBiS2O was ﬁrst reported.24 Later in
1990s, several new analogous compounds RBiS2O (R = La, Pr, Nd and Yb) were synthesized, and
were found to exhibit semiconducting behavior.25 Until recently, superconductivity was observed
by electron doping via F-for-O substitution (the ﬁrst rational strategy mentioned above).12 Band
structure calculations indicate that the prototype parent compound LaBiS2O is a band insulator
with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV.26–29 The conduction bands mainly consist of Bi- 6px and 6py
orbitals which are probably responsible for the superconductivity (note that hole doping fails to
induce superconductivity in the 1121 system30). This leads to an effective two-orbitals (px and py)
model,31 on which possible unconventional superconductivity was proposed.31–33
We recently synthesized a novel member in the 1121 family, EuBiS2F (Eu-1121), which shows
a possible charge-density wave (CDW) and superconductivity without extrinsic chemical doping.22
As a comparison, its sister compound SrBiS2F is a band insulator,21,34 and superconductivity ap-
pears only by electron doping through a heterovalent substitution.21 We revealed that this Eu-1121
material was actually self doped due to Eu valence ﬂuctuations.22 Albeit of relatively low doping
level and presence of CDW instability, superconductivity emerges at 0.3 K. These results demon-
strate that the Eu-containing bismuth sulﬁdes bear new interesting phenomena that are distinct
from other BiS2-based family members. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore its analogous com-
pounds by the second strategy above – structural design. In this article, we report our successful
trial in synthesizing a new Eu-containing bismuth sulﬁde, Eu3Bi2S4F4 (Eu-3244), designed by in-
corporating an additional EuF2 layer into the Eu-1121 structure (see right side of Figure 1). The
crystal structure is of a new type, to our knowledge, which contains thicker spacer layers of the
Eu3F4 block in addition to the essential 2D BiS2 bilayers. Unlike Eu-1121, there are two crystal-
lographically distinct europium sites in Eu-3244. The Eu ions in the middle of the Eu3F4 layers
were revealed to be in a mixed valence (MV) state with a valence of vEu ∼+2.5 −2.75 (depending
on the different measurement techniques used), while other Eu ions on the top and bottom sides
of the Eu3F4 block layers are essentially divalent. The material shows superconductivity at 1.5 K,
3


ﬁve times of the Tc value of Eu-1121, with no CDW anomaly below 300 K. The appearance of
superconductivity is explained by self electron doping into the conduction bands, owing to the Eu
MV states. Implications of the results are discussed.
Experimental Section
The designed compound Eu3Bi2S4F4 was synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. First,
EuS was presynthesized by reacting stoichiometric Eu pieces (99.9% Alfa Aesar) and S powders
(99.9995% Alfa Aesar) at 1073 K for 10 h. Second, the stoichiometric mixtures of EuS, EuF2
(99.9% Alfa Aesar) and Bi2S3 (99.999% Alfa Aesar) were sintered at 1123 K for 35 h in a sealed
evacuated quartz ampoule. The sample purity were able to be improved by repeating the sintering
procedure. All the operations concerning with the intermediate materials were conducted in an
argon-ﬁlled glove box to avoid the contamination of water and oxygen as far as possible. Never-
theless, the ﬁnal product, being black in color, is stable in air.
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out at room temperature on a PANalytical X-
ray diffractometer (Model EMPYREAN) with a monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation. The lattice
parameters were determined by a least-squares ﬁt using Si as internal standard reference mate-
rial. The crystal structure was determined by a Rietveld reﬁnement, adopting the structural model
designed and, using the program RIETAN-2000.35 The resultant weighted reliable factor Rwp is
6.46% and the goodness-of-ﬁt parameter S is 1.16, indicating validity and correctness of the re-
ﬁnement. High-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM) images were taken at room
temperature with a FEI Tecnai G2 F20 scanning transmission electron microscope. The chemical
composition of the new compound was veriﬁed by energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy af-
ﬁliated to a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (FEI Model SIRION). The electron beam
was focused on a crystalline grain (see Figure S1), and ten EDX spectra from different grains were
collected.
151Eu Mössbauer spectra were measured for the Eu-3244 specimen by using a conventional
4


constant acceleration drive and ∼50 mCi 151Sm2O3 source. The experimental spectra were ana-
lyzed by two Lorentzian lines from which values for the isomer shift (δ), the spectral area of the
resonance absorption lines, and the quadrupole interactions were derived. The analysis consid-
ered also the exact shape of the source emission line.36 The velocity calibration was performed
with an α-iron foil at room temperature and the reported δ values are relative to Eu2O3 at room
temperature.
Magnetic measurements were performed on a Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measure-
ment System (MPMS-5) using 6.06 mg Eu-3244 sample. The temperature dependence of dc mag-
netic susceptibility was measured from 1.9 to 400 K. The dc magnetization was also measured
as a function of magnetic ﬁeld. The temperature-dependent resistivity and speciﬁc heat capacity
were measured down to 0.5 K using a standard four-probe method and a relaxation technique, re-
spectively, on a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS-9) with a 3He
refrigerator inserted. A rectangular bar (2.5×1.5×1.1 mm3), cut from the as-prepared Eu-3244
pellet, was employed for the measurement. Gold wires (φ=30 µm) were attached onto the sam-
ple’s surface with silver paint, and the contact pads caused an uncertainty in the absolute values
of resistivity of ±20%. The applied current was 0.5 mA. In the heat capacity measurement, the
sample was cut and polished into a thin square plate (2.8×2.8×0.2 mm3, 10.7 mg), and it was
carefully placed onto the sample holder coated with a thin layer of Apiezon N-grease. The heat
capacity from the sample holder and grease was deducted. All the specimens measured were taken
from the same batch.
Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure
Figure 1 shows structural characterizations for the Eu-3244 sample. The powder XRD patterns
can be well indexed by a tetragonal cell with a = 4.077 Å and c = 32.433 Å, except for several tiny
reﬂections (the intensity of the strongest impurity peak is less than 3% of that of the main phase)
5


from Bi and EuF2.4 impurities. The diffraction indexes (hkl) obey h+k +l = even numbers, indi-
cating a body-centered lattice. The unit cell is conﬁrmed by HRTEM images of the [001] and [100]
zones (see the inset of Figure 1a). Compared with the cell parameters of Eu-1121 [a = 4.0508(1)
Å and c = 13.5338(3) Å],22 the a axis is merely 0.026 Å larger, and one half of the c axis (because
of the body centered unit cell) is 2.683 Å longer. The difference (1
2c3244−c1121) basically agrees
with the thickness of a single EuF2 crystallographic layer (e.g., 2.92 Å in cubic EuF2, according
to ICDD PDF #12−0391). The HRTEM images conﬁrm the structure as designed, by showing the
heavy elements (like Eu and Bi) at their corresponding positions. Our EDX spectroscopy experi-
ment (see Figure S1 and Table S1) gives a chemical formula of Eu3.1(4)Bi1.8(1)S4.4(3)F3.7(7), which
is close to the stoichiometric Eu3Bi2S4F4. Furthermore, based on the structure model, the Rietveld
reﬁnement was very successful (note that preferential orientation of crystalline grains was included
because of the plate-like morphology as seen in the inset of Figure S1), as shown in Figure 1b. We
thus conclude that the target new material Eu3Bi2S4F4, with additional EuF2 layers to the Eu-1121
structure, was successfully synthesized.
The reﬁned structural parameters of Eu-3244 are listed in Table 1. Notably, there are two
different crystallographic sites, 4e and 2a for Eu(1) and Eu(2), respectively. The Eu(1) cations are
coordinated by four F−and ﬁve S2−anions, the same as all the Eu ions in Eu-1121. For the Eu(2)
cations, however, the coordination atoms are eight nearest F−anions [there are two S(1) anions at
a distance of 3.80 Å from Eu(2), which are usually not considered as the ligands]. As is known,
the valence of a certain cation can be evaluated by the bond valence sum (BVS).37 Based on the
bond distances in Table 1, the Eu-BVS was calculated by the formula ∑exp(R0−di j
0.37 ), where R0 is
empirical parameters and di j represents the bond distances between Eu and its coordination anions.
Since the R0 value is 2.04 Å and 1.961 Å, respectively, for Eu2+ – F−and Eu3+ – F−bonds,38
we performed a self-consistent iteration process for the calculation. The resultant Eu-BVS values
for Eu(1) and Eu(2) are +1.96(3) and +2.64(5), respectively [note that inclusion of the two S(1)
will not bring an appreciable change (within 0.01) in Eu(2)-BVS]. This result indicates an unusual
scenario for the Eu valence states: the Eu(1) ions are essentially divalent, but simultaneously, the

Mössbauer Spectra
To conﬁrm the Eu valence state in Eu-3244, the 151Eu Mössbauer spectra were measured, as shown
in Figure 2. Two separate absorption lines are displayed with the isomer shifts at δ1 = −13.9(1)
and δ2 = −0.8(1) mm/s, which are obviously ascribed to the resonance absorptions of Eu2+ and
Eu3+ nuclei, respectively. With increasing the temperature up to 395 K, neither the δ1 and δ2
values, nor the absorption intensity of Eu3+ relative to that of Eu2+, and nor the line widths change
signiﬁcantly. This is in sharp contrast with the observations in Eu-1121 material where all the
Mössbauer parameters vary with temperature, in relation with Eu valence ﬂuctuations.22 Since the
probing time of Mössbauer measurement is about 10−9 s, which is much longer than the usual time
8


scale of electron dynamics in solids, the temperature-independent isomer shifts and the line widths
indicate static or quasi-static MV of Eu. Note that the isomer shifts of Eu2+ and Eu3+ lines are
about 0.3 mm/s smaller than those of Eu-1121 at low temperatures. This may reﬂect difference in
the hybridization between Eu-4 f electrons and the conduction electrons.

Figure 2: 151Eu Mössbauer spectra of Eu3Bi2S4F4 at 85, 298 and 395 K. The blue and red lines
represent the ﬁtted curves contributed from Eu2+ and Eu3+ ions, respectively.
Table 2 lists the 151Eu Mössbauer parameters at different temperatures obtained by the data ﬁt-
ting with consideration of the exact shape of the emission spectrum of 151Sm2O3 and the quadrupole
interactions. Consistent with the above qualitative analysis, there is no obvious variations in isomer
shifts, line widths, and also quadrupole interactions for the Eu2+ lines, with changing temperature.
Notably, no electrical quadrupole interaction is derived for the Eu3+ absorption lines. This means
that the Eu3+ ions are indeed located at the Eu(2) site where the electric ﬁeld gradient is virtually
zero due to its highly symmetric coordinations. The population fraction of Eu3+, scaled by the
relative absorption areas, shows minor temperature dependence, from 0.25 (at 85 K) to 0.30 (at
395 K), which can be interpreted by a small difference in the Debye-Waller factors between Eu3+
and Eu2+. Similar observation was reported in Eu2CuS3, in which the Debye temperature of Eu3+
9


is higher than that of Eu2+.39 In this circumstance, low-temperature data should more accurately
reﬂect the population fraction. Taken the 85-K result, i.e., Eu3+/(Eu2++Eu3+) = 0.25(1), and with
all the Eu3+ ions occupied Eu(2) site [simultaneously, the Eu(1) ions are purely divalent], the Eu(2)
valence, vEu2, can be easily estimated to be +2.75(3), which is not far from the Eu(2)-BVS value
of +2.64(5). One may expect that the ’real’ vEu2 value could be somewhat lower, if considering a
little higher recoil-free fraction for Eu3+ ions, and if the Mössbauer data were collected at lower
temperatures. Therefore, the unusual Eu valence states obtained by BVS approach are conﬁrmed
by Mössbauer techniques.

Magnetic Susceptibility
Figure 3a shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility (in emu/mol-fu, where fu
refers to formula unit), χ(T), for the Eu-3244 sample. The χ(T) data well follow the extended
Curie-Weiss law, χ = χ0+C/(T +θN), where χ0 denotes the temperature independent components
of susceptibility, C the Curie constant, and θN the paramagnetic Neel temperature. The Curie-
Weiss ﬁtting gives an average effective moment of 7.28 µB Eu-atom−1, which is substantially less
than the expected value for Eu2+ ions (7.94 µB Eu-atom−1). This indicates existence of Eu3+ ions
which show Van Vleck paramagnetism due to spin-orbit interaction.40,41 The Van Vleck magnetic
susceptibility is a function of the spin-orbit coupling constant λ as well as temperature T, i.e.,
χVV ∝f(λ,T).40–42 With ˜vEu denotes the average Eu valence [consequently, the Eu2+ content is
10


(9 −3˜vEu) per fu, and the Eu3+ content is (3˜vEu −6) per fu], therefore, a more accurate ﬁtting of
the χ(T) data in a wide range of 10 K ≤T ≤400 K was performed by equation,
χ(T) = χ(Eu2+)+ χ(Eu3+)+ χ0,
(1)
where χ(Eu2+) = C2+(9 −3˜vEu)/(T +θN) and χ(Eu3+) = C3+(3˜vEu −6) f(λ,T). With the unit
of emu mol-fu−1 for χ(T), C2+ and C3+ are settled to be 7.875 and 0.125 emu mol-fu−1 K−1,
respectively, and there are actually only four parameters (˜vEu,θN,λ and χ0) to be ﬁtted. The
ﬁtting was very successful, which gives rise to the following results. (1) ˜vEu = 2.167(1), meaning
2.50 Eu2+ and 0.50 Eu3+ in a unit formula of Eu-3244. This conclusion basically agrees with
the Eu-BVS and Mössbauer results above. (2) The spin-orbit coupling constant λ is ﬁtted to be
419±19 K, which is a reasonable value for the related europium compounds.42 (3) The ﬁtted χ0
value is as high as 0.0120(1) emu mol-fu−1, suggesting an exceptionally large Pauli paramagnetic
contribution. This means very high density of state at the Fermi level (EF), like the case in Eu-1121
which shows substantial hybridizations between Eu-4 f and conduction bands.22 The heat capacity
result below also supports this speculation. (4) The paramagnetic Neel temperature θN is +2.63
K, suggesting a dominant antiferromagnetic interactions among the Eu2+ spins. This is consistent
with the antiferromagnetic-like transition at 2.3 K, as shown in the inset of Figure 3a.
The above analysis on χ(T) is actually based on the presumption that ˜vEu does not change
with temperature. So, it is necessary to check the ˜vEu value at a certain temperature, preferably
at sufﬁciently low temperatures which reﬂects ground-state properties. The ﬁeld-dependent mag-
netization, M(H), shown in Figure 3b, just gives the information. At 300 K, the magnetization
increases slowly and linearly with the applied ﬁeld, in accordance with the small susceptibility.
At low temperatures, however, the M(H) curves deviate from linearity, and tend to saturate at
high magnetic ﬁelds. The M(H) curve at 5 K can be well ﬁtted by a Brillouin function with con-
sideration of Weiss molecular ﬁeld Bmf = ξM. The ﬁtted saturation magnetization is 16.78 µB
fu−1, corresponding to 2.40 Eu2+ and 0.60 Eu3+ in a unit formula of Eu-3244. The result is in

Mössbauer-spectrum evaluations. Besides, the ﬁtted parameter ξ is negative (−0.09), conform-
ing to the positive value of θN and the antiferromagnetic transition at 2.3 K. The M(H) curve at
2 K cannot be well ﬁtted by a Brillouin function because it is in a magnetically ordered state.
The derivative of magnetization shown in the inset of Figure 3b indiactes a metamagnetic-like
transition occurs around the ﬁeld µ0H = 1 T below the Neel temperature.
Electrical Resistivity
Figure 4a shows the temperature dependence of resistivity, ρ(T), for the Eu-3244 polycrystalline
sample. It exhibits metallic conduction with positive temperature coefﬁcient of resistivity (TCR)
above 35 K, albeit without extrinsic doping. This is obviously due to the self doping effect arising
from the Eu MV, like the case in Eu-1121. The positive TCR is in contrast with the negative TCR
in the electron-doped Sr1−xLaxBiS2F system even for x > 0.5.21,43,44 The latter was interpreted by
Anderson localization,43 because the extrinsic La/Sr substitution brings about disorder potentials
in the conducting BiS2 bilayers. In Eu-3244 and Eu-1121 systems, no extrinsic chemical doping is
applied, and the Anderson localization effect is largely reduced. Compared with Eu-1121, however,
it is remarkable that Eu-3244 does not show any CDW-like anomaly below 300 K.
Below 1.5 K, the resistivity drops abruptly, and it achieves zero at 1.4 K (see the inset), in-
dicating a superconducting transition. The narrow superconducting transition width (< 0.1 K) at
zero ﬁeld suggests bulk superconductivity (note that the measured sample is nearly monophasic
polycrystal). The Tc value is nearly ﬁve times of that in Eu-1121, and is comparable to that in
Sr1−xLaxBiS2F system with x = 0.4.44
The superconductivity was conﬁrmed by the magnetoresistance measurement.45 With apply-
ing magnetic ﬁelds, the superconducting transition shifts down to lower temperatures. Moreover,
the transition width is broadened, which is the characteristic of strongly anisotropic superconduc-
tors in which magnetic ﬂux ﬂow produces extra resistance. The upper critical ﬁeld, Hc2, can be
obtained from the ρ(T,H) data. If employing the conventional criterion of 90% of the normal-

state resistivity to determine Tc(H), Hc2 could be underestimated because of the severe broad-
ening of the superconducting transition. Hence, we made an additional criterion to determine
Hc2 by deﬁning T onset
c
(H) (see Figure 4b). The Hc2(T) data satisfy the Ginzburg-Landau law,46
Hc2(T) = Hc2(0)(1−t2)/(1+t2), where t denotes a reduced temperature of T/Tc. The upper crit-
ical ﬁeld at zero temperature, Hc2(0), is then estimated to be 5.9 kOe and 23.4 kOe, respectively,
for the different criteria employed. The latter Hc2(0) value is close to HP = 18.4 Tc ≈27.6 kOe,
suggesting Pauli limited behavior in this system.
Speciﬁc Heat
Figure 5a shows the temperature dependence of speciﬁc heat, C(T), for the Eu-3244 sample. The
C(T) data at high temperatures tend to saturate above 300 J K−1 mol−1, close to the Dulong-Petit
value of 3NR = 39R = 324 J K−1 mol−1, where N counts the number of elements per fu, R is the gas
constant. A sharp λ-shape peak at 2.2 K is observed (see the magniﬁed plot in the upper left inset),
coinciding with magnetic measurement which indicates an antiferromagnetic ordering of the Eu2+
spins at 2.3 K. The divergence in C(T) at 2.3 K conﬁrms the long-range magnetic ordering, which
is in contrast with the hump-shape peak for Eu-1121 where a spin glass state is likely to formed.22
The low-temperature C(T) data (T < 2 K) are predominately from magnetic contributions, which
can be ﬁtted by the sum of a linear term and a quadratic term. The quadratic term can be ascribed
to the excitations of 2D antiferromagnetic spin waves.47 The linear term, which generally appears
in a spin-glass state,48 implies existence of spin glass that probably occurs in the Eu(2) sublattice
due to the Eu mixed valence. The large magnetic signal of ∼20 J K−1 mol−1 prevents the direct
observation of a possible jump in C(T), estimated to be ∼0.2 J K−1 mol−1, associated with
the superconducting transition around 1.5 K. Nevertheless, we indeed observed a kink at 1.43 K
(see the lower right inset of Figure 5a) that could be related to the superconducting transition,
when subtracting the contributions from magnetism (the linear and quadratic terms), electrons and
lattice.
Similar to the C(T) analysis for Eu-1121,22 the different contributions from conduction elec-

trons (Cel), crystalline lattice (Clat) and Eu magnetism (Cm) can be separated, assuming that Cm
is negligibly small above 10 K. The C/T vs T 2 plot, shown in the inset of Figure 5b gives γ =
159 mJ K−2 mol−1 and β = 3.00 mJ K−4 mol−1. The Debye temperature is then obtained by
θD = [(12/5)NRπ4/β]1/3 = 203 K, which is almost identical to that of Eu-1121.22 The ﬁtted γ
value is also close to that of Eu-1121 based on per mol-Bi (because of Bi-6p electrons mainly
contribute the conduction bands). Using the formula N(EF) = 3γ/(πkB)2, the density of state
at EF estimated is as high as 65 eV−1 fu−1, which explains the unusually large Pauli magnetic
susceptibility above.
The magnetic contribution Cm was then obtained by removing the sum of Clat (= βT 3) and Cel
(= γT), as shown in Figure 5b. Consequently, the magnetic entropy released can be calculated by
the integration Sm =
R T
0 (Cm/T)dT (see Figure 5c). We obtained Sm = 36.2 J K−1 mol−1 at 15 K,
equivalent to 2.09 times of Rln(2S + 1) (S=7/2 for Eu2+). It is noted that the Sm value could be
underestimated because short-range spin ordering may extend to higher temperatures above 15 K.
Remember in mind that Sm refers to the change in magnetic entropy, the value 2.09 only counts
the Eu2+ ions that order magnetically at low temperatures. Therefore, the speciﬁc heat data do not
contradict with the conclusion of Eu mixed valence above. The unexpectedly low Sm suggests spin
glass state for the Eu(2) ions, consistent with the implication of the low-temperatureC(T) behavior
and, in conformity with the mixed valence state exclusively at the Eu(2) site.
Discussion
Let us ﬁrst discuss the issue of Eu MV. As we know, europium is a special rare earth element
that frequently shows MV due to the stability of half ﬁlling of 4 f orbitals for divalent Eu2+ ions
(usually trivalent rare earth is the stable state). Basically, there are two distinct categories for the
Eu MV according to its dynamicity. The ﬁrst MV scenario is homogeneous, in the sense that
the mixed-valent Eu ions are indistinguishable in a short time (e.g., 10−9 s). This MV behavior
is characterized by valence ﬂuctuations due to hybridization between Eu-4 f electrons with the
conduction electrons, as exempliﬁed by EuNi2P2.49 Obviously, it occurs only in a material that
17


all the Eu ions occupy the crystallographically equivalent sites. In contrast, if the Eu ions with
different valences selectively occupy the different crystallographic sites, the MV will be static in
nature. Such a scenario is called inhomogeneous MV, which is equivalent to static charge order-
ing. Examples of this category are shown in Eu2CuS3,39 Eu2SiN3,50 and Eu3F4S2,51 etc., where
Eu2+ and Eu3+ occupy their individual sites. Note that, in the homogeneous Eu-MV state, vEu
usually increases remarkably with decreasing temperature, because of dominant thermal ﬂuctua-
tions (rather than quantum mixing) between the two integer-valence states.52 More frequently, a
ﬁrst-order structural transition occurs accompanying with an abrupt change in vEu. In such cases,
the MV becomes inhomogeneous at low temperatures because of static or quasi-static character of
MV, as evidenced by two separate lines in the 151Eu Mössbauer spectra.53,54
Compared with the conventional scenarios for Eu MV described above, the Eu-containing bis-
muth chalcogenides, including Eu-1121 and Eu-3244, exhibit unusual MV behaviors. The Eu
valence in Eu-1121 was found to be nearly temperature-independent down to 2 K.22 This has been
interpreted by Eu valence ﬂuctuations that couple with the dynamic CDW in the BiS2 bilayers.
However, the situation is different here for Eu-3244. There are two crystallographically different
sites for the Eu ions. Unlike the aforementioned examples that different Eu sites are occupied by
Eu2+ and Eu3+, respectively, the Eu(2) ions at the 2a site are in a MV state, while the 4e-site Eu(1)
ions are essentially divalent. Our 151Eu Mössbauer spectra clearly show static or quasi-static MV
up to 395 K, and the Eu3+ ions occupy the Eu(2) site. Since the Eu-4 f 7 narrow band touches the
Fermi level of the conduction band in Eu-1121,22 it is plausible that, because of stronger crystal
ﬁeld for Eu(2), the Eu(2)-4 f 7 band is lifted further in Eu-3244. Consequently, the Eu(2) ions are in
a MV state, driven by the electrons transfer from an Eu(2)-4 f orbital to the conduction bands. On
the other hand, the Eu(1)-4 f 7 band is lowered due to the relatively weak crystal ﬁeld [note that the
Eu(1)-BVS value is substantially smaller than the Eu-BVS in Eu-1121]. This leads to a fully ﬁlled
Eu(1)-4 f 7 band, i.e., the Eu(1) ions are divalent. Future band-structure calculations are expected
to clarify this explanation.
Owing to the Eu(2) MV with vEu2 ≈2.6(1), the conduction bands of BiS2 bilayers should be
18


self doped with the transferred electrons from the Eu-4 f states, similar to the case in Eu-1121.22
The doping level is estimated to be x ∼0.30(5) electrons per Bi-atom, assuming that stoichiometry
is conserved. This explains the appearance of superconductivity as well as the metallic conduction
in the undoped Eu-3244. Here we note that similar self doping, via an internal charge transfer
from 3d transition metal ions (V and Ti), leads to high-temperature superconductivity in iron-based
materials.9,10 Thus, the direction of self doping deserves further attention.
It is unexpected that no signature of CDW transition appears in Eu-3244. In general, the en-
hanced 2D characteristic in Eu-3244 would further stabilize the potential CDW. Therefore, the
obvious difference in Eu MV could be relevant. In Eu-3244, the Eu(2) MV occurs in the middle
layers of the Eu3F4 block, farther from the BiS2 bilayers. In addition, the Eu(2) ions show much
higher valence, leading to a different pattern of charge ordering. These two factors seem to be
against the possible coupling between the CDW of BiS2 layers and the Eu MV.
Since CDW usually competes with superconductivity, the absence of CDW in Eu-3244 may
explain the relatively high Tc value (ﬁvefold of the Tc value in Eu-1121). It is also possible, of
course, that the pronounced two dimensionality in Eu-3244 may enhance the superconductivity.
Considering the relatively low doping level, one may expect that a higher Tc could be realized by
extrinsic chemical doping and/or with applying high pressures. The latter is very expectable since
high pressure was found to be very effective to enhance the Tc value in BiS-based materials,55–58
and high pressure may push the parent compound toward metallic conduction.59 Also, in this
regard, exploration of new superconductors with the 3244-type structure is of potential interest.
Conclusion
We have discovered a novel europium bismuth sulfoﬂuoride superconductor, Eu3Bi2S4F4, via a
structural-design approach by introducing an additional EuF2 layer into the existing Eu2F2 spacer
layers in EuBiS2F. The crystal structure, featured with the existence of two crystallographically
distinct europium sites, was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as
19


well as X-ray diffractions. We investigated the Eu valence state by: (1) structural probing with
calculation of Eu-BVS; (2) internal and local probing with 151Eu Mössbauer spectroscopy; and (3)
bulk probing with analysis of magnetic properties. The results of these three probes consistently
point to an anomalous Eu valence state in which the Eu(1)-site cations are essentially divalent,
whilst the Eu(2)-site cations are in a mixed valence state with a valence of ∼+2.6(1). The mixed
valence allows charge transfer, which realizes electron doping into the conduction bands that are
mainly composed of Bi- 6px and 6py orbitals. That is why we observed metallic conduction and
superconductivity in the undoped Eu3Bi2S4F4. Our work could inspire further exploration of new
superconductors, especially those with self doping, in BiS2-based and other families.
