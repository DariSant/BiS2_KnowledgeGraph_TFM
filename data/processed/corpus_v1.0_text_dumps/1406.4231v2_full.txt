We study the impact of hydrostatic pressure on superconductivity of new BiS2 based 
layered REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE-La, Pr, and Nd) compounds through the measurements of dc 
electrical resistivity. The REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE-La, Pr and Nd) compounds synthesized by solid 
state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation are crystallized in the tetragonal P4/nmm space 
group. At ambient pressure the superconducting transition onset temperatures (Tc
onset) are 2.7K, 
3.5K and 4.5K which are enhanced substantially under external hydrostatic pressure to 10.5K, 
7.8K and 7.5K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 respectively at 1.68GPa. 
The normal state electrical resistivity decreases with applied pressure for REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE-La, 
Pr and Nd). The electrical resistivity under magnetic field and applied pressure has been 
measured to estimate upper critical field Hc2(0), the values of which are 15.9Tesla, 8.8Tesla and 
8.2Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. Substantial 
enhancement of superconductivity under moderate pressures in studied new BiS2 based 
superconductors call for the attention of condensed matter physics community.

Introduction: 
Since the discovery of superconductivity in layered BiS2 based superconductors Bi4O4S3 
with Tc =4.5K [1, 2] and REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE=La, Ce, Pr and Nd) with Tc =3K -10K [3-10], lot of 
studies have been done by both experimentalists and theoreticians. These compounds consist of 


 
2
two dimensional BiS2 layers with different charge reservoir blocks in structure as similar to FeAs 
in Fe- based and CuO2 in high Tc cuprate superconductors [11, 12]. Basically, parent phase of 
BiS2 based superconductors exhibit the Mott-insulating or semiconducting behavior. According 
to some theoretical studies, the fundamental electronic properties are attributed to the BiS2 layers 
[1-10]. The band structure can be described as the valance band being consisting of S3p and O2p 
orbitals and the conduction band is mainly attributed to Bi6pxy and S3p [13-15]. The electron 
doping is achieved through the O-2 site F-1 substitution. The weak correlation effect in p orbitals 
has been suggested by some band structure calculation studies. Also it is suggested that possibly 
the electron phonon coupling plays an important role in superconducting pairing in these systems 
[13–17].   
 Superconductivity has been observed in the layered BiS2 based compounds through the 
onsite chemical substitutions. For example, the O2- site F-1 doped REOBiS2 compounds show 
superconductivity in range of 2.5 to 5K, and Sr2+ site La+3 doped SrFBiS2 exhibit 
superconductivity near 2.5K [18-20]. The superconductivity has also been observed in LaOBiS2 
by chemical substitution of the tetravalent ions viz. Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4 and Ti+4 for trivalent La+3 
[21]. Basically, it is the doping of mobile carriers in conducting BiS2 layer via O2-/F-1, Sr2+/La3+ 
or La3+/Th4+, Hf4+, Zr4+ substitution in charge reservoir REO layer. The doping mechanism 
seems pretty same to that as in case of high Tc cuprate and Fe based pnictide superconductors 
[11,12]. The role of Rare earth elements is also crucial in superconductivity of BiS2 based 
compounds similar to that as for Fe based high Tc superconductors. Some experimental studies 
showed that superconductivity effectively increases as light rare earth element is replaced by the 
heavier one [3-10]. The pressure dependent studies have also been done, which resulted in 
modifying the superconducting properties of these BiS2 based superconductors [22-25]. The 
externally applied pressure may effectively change in lattice constants through bond lengths and 
angles and that could affect the electronic and magnetic correlations of a superconductor [24]. In 
addition, the structural phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic has also been reported on 
the basis of analysis of the x-ray diffraction patterns under high pressure for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
superconductor [16]. More recently perfect tetragonal structure has been reported for the high 
pressure synthesized of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 compound [27]. In any case, the pressure effect studies on 
the BiS2 superconductors need to be explored further by different research groups, because yet 
only scant reports do exist [22-25].

Here we present the effect of pressure on the superconductivity of the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 
(La, Pr & Nd). At zero pressure the normal state resistivity of all the compounds show 
semiconducting behaviour. As the pressure increases the normal state resistivity is suppressed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds and slightly increased initially for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
compound. Further their superconducting properties are enhanced dramatically under moderate 
hydrostatic pressures and the impact of the same is most in case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The electrical 
resistivity under magnetic field and applied pressure gave the estimated Hc2(0) values of 
15.9Tesla, 8.8Tesla and 8.2Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 
compounds. Interestingly the estimated Hc2(0) values are close to Pauli paramagnetic limit of 
1.84Tc, indicating the robustness of superconductivity in BiS2 based new superconducting 
systems.    
Experimental Details:  
The bulk polycrystalline REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Pr, & Nd) samples have been 
synthesized by solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity chemicals La, 
La2O3, LaF3, Bi and S are used for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2; Pr, Pr6O11, PrF3, Bi, and S are used for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd, Nd2O3, NdF3, Bi and S are used for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. The 
chemicals are weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground in glove box filled with high purity 
Argon. The mixed powder was subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-4 mbar) in a 
quartz tube. The box furnace have been used to sinter the samples at 6500C for 12h with the 
typical heating rate of 2oC/minute and subsequently cooled down slowly to room temperature. 
This process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in 
the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-80o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer 
with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed using the standard FullProf program.  
The pressure dependent resistivity measurements were performed on Physical Property 
Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) by using HPC-33 Piston type pressure cell 
with Quantum design DC resistivity Option. Hydrostatic pressures were generated by a 
BeCu/NiCrAl clamped piston-cylinder cell. The sample was immersed in a fluid pressure 
transmitting medium of Fluorinert (FC70:FC77=1:1) in a Teflon cell. Annealed Pt leads were 
affixed to gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-
wire configuration. The pressure at low temperature was calibrated from the superconducting 
transition temperature of Pb.

Results and discussion: 
Figure 1(a) shows the room temperature observed and Reitveld fitted XRD pattern of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. All the compounds are 
crystallized in tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm. Small impurity peaks, close to the 
background of Bi2S3 and Bi are also observed in all the three compounds. All the studied samples 
are phase pure within the XRD limit. Reitveld fitted lattice parameters are a=4.06(2)Å, 
c=13.38(1)Å for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2; a=4.0(2)Å, c=13.42(1)Å for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and a=3.99(3)Å, 
c=13.38(1)Å for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. The volume of the unit cell obtained through the 
Reitveld fitting analysis of each compound is 221.71(1)Å3 for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, 216.33(1)Å3 for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 214.60(1)Å3 for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. The volume of unit cell is decreased from 
221.71(1)Å3 to 214.60(1)Å3 with the decrease in atomic radii of the RE element. Figure 1(b) 
shows the schematic unit cell of the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds, which has been drown from 
Reitveld refined parameters. The details are discussed elsewhere [4,6,7].     
Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependent electrical resistivity from 300K down to 2K 
at various applied pressures for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. At ambient pressure normal state 
resistivity ρ(T) exhibits semiconducting behaviour, which is strongly suppressed with increasing 
pressure from 0-0.97GPa and later nearly unaltered for the higher applied pressures of above 
1GPa. Figure 2(b) depicts the zoom part of the ρ(T) from 14K down to 2K near the 
superconducting transition regime  at various pressures. It can be clearly seen that the 
superconducting temperature Tc(ρ=0) is 2K at 0GPa pressure, which increases to 2.5K at applied 
pressure of 0.35GPa. Interestingly for the applied pressure of 0.55GPa, the Tc(ρ=0) and Tc
onset 
increase to 5K and 9.8K respectively with broadening of the superconducting transition. For the 
applied pressure of 0.97GPa, though the Tc
onset is increased only marginally to 10.5K, the 
Tc(ρ=0) is increased sharply to 9.5K, with relatively sharper superconducting transition. For the 
further higher applied pressures of 1.35GPa and 1.68GPa, though the Tc
onset and Tc(ρ=0) are 
nearly unchanged, but the normal state resistivity is still being suppressed progressively. The 
obtained highest Tc
onset is 10.5K for the applied pressure of 0.97GPa. The pressure coefficient 
dTc
onset/dP for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is estimated to be around 8.25K/GPa at 0.97GPa.  
 Plots of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ(T) below 300K for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 at various pressures of 0 to 1.97GPa are shown in Figure 3(a). The compound 
exhibits semiconducting behavior. The normal state resistivity is strongly suppressed with 


 
5
applied pressures similar to LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, but yet the compound exhibits the 
semiconducting behaviour, till highest studied pressure of 1.97GPa. Figure 3(b) shows the ρ(T) 
curve in the temperature range of 10K to 2K to visualise the superconducting transition 
temperature of the compound at various pressures. It is clearly seen that with applied pressures 
the Tc
onset increases from 3.5K to 6.5K at 1.38GPa and the Tc(ρ=0)  is increased slightly from 
around 3K to 4K. For further higher applied pressures of 1.68 and 1.97GPa, both the Tc
onset and 
Tc(ρ=0)  are saturated at around 7.5K and 6K respectively. The estimated dTc
onset/dP for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is ~2.38K/GPa.   
Figure 4(a) represents ρ(T) below 300K for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 at various pressures from 0 to 
1.97GPa. At the ambient pressure normal state resistivity ρ(T) exhibits semiconducting 
behaviour. Both normal state resistivity and the semiconducting behaviour are suppressed 
initially with applied pressure. For higher pressures though the decrease in resistivity is not 
monotonic and rather the same increase slightly, but the semiconducting behaviour keeps on 
improving.    Figure 4(b) shows the expanded part of Figure 4(a) in superconducting regime from 
10K to 3K, to clearly visualize the change in Tc with pressure. The NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound 
shows the Tc(ρ=0)  at 4.1K for 0GPa pressure and the same slightly increases up to 4.3K for the 
applied pressure of 0.35 and 0.55GPa. At 0.97GPa applied pressure, the Tc(ρ=0) and Tc
onset 
increase to 4.5K and 6K respectively, with slight broadening of the superconducting transition. 
For the applied pressure of 1.38GPa the superconducting transition temperature is nearly the 
same but the Tc
onset is increased and the resistivity behaviour is changed.  For still higher applied 
pressure of 1.68 and 1.97GPa the Tc(ρ=0)  of the sample is increased to 6K and the Tc
onset to 
7.5K. The pressure coefficient dTc
onset/dP for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 is thus nearly 1.8K/GPa.  
The Pressure dependence of superconducting transition temperature Tc(ρ=0) for the 
studied LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds is plotted in Figure 5. For 
the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound the Tc(ρ=0) is enhanced sharply at 0.97GPa. We mark this pressure 
as PT. Interestingly, for the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds the PT is at 1.68GPa. 
Not only the PT is nearly half (0.97GPa) for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 than of 1.68GPa for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2/NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, the increase in Tc(ρ=0)  at PT is around four fold for former and 
only two fold for the later ones. In our studies within limited range of applied pressure of up to 
1.97GPa, though we did not observe any deleterious effect on superconductivity, but the 
saturation is clearly seen below the studied pressures. Worth mentioning is the fact that though 


 
6
our results are qualitatively similar to that as reported recently by Wolowiec et al [23,24], a 
confirmation of such an interesting result (four fold increase in Tc at just ~ 1GPa)  by 
independent research group was warranted.   
Figure 6 shows the log(ρ) vs 1/T plots for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound  at various pressures 
of up to 1.68GPa. This is done to find out the change in values of semiconducting transport 
energy gaps with pressure, as proposed earlier [23, 24]. It is seen in Figs. 2, 3 and 4, that the 
normal state semiconducting behaviours gets suppressed with application of pressure in studied 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE=La, Pr and Nd). The fitting of log(ρ) vs 1/T for transport data could 
effectively provide the information about change in semiconducting energy gap. It has been 
observed earlier that the resistivity data can be described in to distinct regions from the relation 
ρ(T) = ρ0eΔ/2kBT where ρ0 is a constant, Δ is an energy gap and kB is Boltzmann constant [22]. 
Resistivity data in the whole temperature range is not possible to fit linearly in above relation, so 
we are using the same formulism as used by Kotegawa et al. [22]. They explain the two energy 
gaps as Δ1 and Δ2 in the temperature range 300 to 200K and from 20K to Tc
onset respectively. The 
estimated values of the energy gaps are Δ1/kB ≈201K and Δ2/kB ≈11.98K for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
compound at zero pressure. The obtained values are comparable to the previous report on the 
same compound [22] but significantly less than the ones reported by Wolowiec et al. for the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [23].  
Figures 7 (a) and (b) shows the behaviour of energy gaps at the different pressures from 
0-1.68GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and from 0-1.97GPa for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. Worth 
mentioning is the fact that the non-monotonic change is semiconducting behaviour of 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 with pressure did not allow the log(ρ) vs 1/T fitting for the same at least for 
higher pressure range of above 0.97GPa. Both the energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 decrease with the 
applied pressure from 0-1.68GPa for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, please see Fig. 7(a). The saturation in the 
decrement of energy gaps may be possible for the higher applied pressures, as reported by 
Wolowiec et al. [23]. We have also obtained the values of energy gaps Δ1 and Δ2 for the 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. At the ambient pressure the evaluated values of energy gaps are Δ1/kB 
≈108.3 K and Δ2/kB ≈ 4.7 K for the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. From the Figures 7(b) it can be 
observed that both the energy gaps decreases rapidly, indicating better conduction with 
increasing the pressure. For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound the first energy gap (Δ1) value is almost 
saturated at 1.97GPa. It may be possible that with application of pressure the bond angle and 


 
7
band structure changes, which positively affect the electronic and magnetic correlations. The 
application of pressure could also moderate the charge carrier density at the Fermi surface in 
these BiS2 based systems [26]. Also the possibility of very strong electron correlations in 
superconducting BiS2 layers need to be explored.  Interestingly, in some theoretical studies an 
insulator to metal transition under pressure along with superconductivity at low temperatures has 
been suggested for the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [18].   
Figure 8 (a)-(c) represent the temperature dependent resistivity under applied magnetic 
fields of up to 5Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, at 1.68GPa, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 at 1.97GPa and 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 at 1.97GPa pressure. For all the compounds the superconductivity decreases with 
increasing applied field as similar to any type II superconductor. Interestingly, the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
is relatively more robust against magnetic field than PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2.  Relative 
decrement in superconductivity with field i.e., dTc/dH is around 1.2K/Tesla from absolute          
Tc (ρ=0) criteria for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, which is near about the same as for Fe Pnictides [11] and 
more than the High Tc superconductors [12]. For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, the dTc/dH 
is around 1.6K/Tesla and 1.79K/Tesla respectively. The upper critical field Hc2(0) of all the 
samples has been estimated by using the conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg 
(WHH) equation for the 90% criterion of the normalized resistivity data, i.e., Hc2(0) = 
−0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc. The estimated Hc2(0) has been shown in the Fig. 9 and the values are 
15.9Tesla, 8.8 Tesla and 8.2Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Interestingly enough the Hc2(0) of around 16Tesla for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound having Tc (ρ=0) 
of 9.5K is very close to the Pauli paramagnetic limit of 1.84Tc .  
Conclusion: 
In conclusion, we reported the impact of hydrostatic pressure on the superconductivity of 
BiS2 based new superconductors 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Superconductivity is enhanced dramatically with improved normal state conduction for all the 
studied systems. These results call for unusual superconductivity in these systems along with 
strong electron correlations. The upper critical field is estimated from electrical resistivity under 
magnetic field and applied pressure data and found to be 15.9Tesla, 8.8 Tesla and 8.2Tesla for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. It seems the BiS2 based superconductors are 
quite robust against magnetic field. Our results are in confirmation with the very recent report by 
Wolowiec et al.[23,24], with an added feature on upper critical field of the under pressure 


 
8
samples. These results on new BiS2 based superconductors are thought provoking and do call for 
the attention of condensed matter physics community.
