Bismuth oxysulfide Bi4O4S3, which has recently been claimed to be an exotic superconductor (Tc = 4.5 
K), was investigated by magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements as well as by 
electron probe microanalysis.  Single-phase Bi4O4S3 was successfully prepared by a high-pressure 
method, and its lattice parameters and normal-state resistivity, as well as the density of states at the 
Fermi level, were found to be comparable to those determined earlier.  However, the observed 
superconductivity was most likely impurity-driven, strictly contradictory to the observations in ongoing 
experiments.  The present results indicate that the superconductivity of Bi4O4S3 does not truly reflect 
the bulk nature of the BiS2 layered phase, regardless of the manner in which Bi4O4S3 is synthesized.  
We discuss possible superconducting impurities.

1. Introduction   
Very recently, several independent research groups in Japan, China, and India have reported 
that bismuth oxysulfide Bi4O4S3 shows exotic bulk superconductivity (SC) in the temperature range of 
4.4–8.6 K.1–3)  The BiS2 layer (square-planar) has been claimed to be the main factor inducing SC in 
Bi4O4S3.4,5)  Although the observed superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) are relatively lower 
than those of other high-Tc materials, this compound is a potential candidate for many applications in 
the field of physics because high-Tc SC is observed only in a layered structure.  In addition, Hall 
coefficient measurements suggest multiband SC in Bi4O4S3, as in the case of Fe-based 
superconductors.5) Hence, further investigation of the SC of Bi4O4S3 may facilitate greater 
understanding of the essential physics related to high-Tc SC.   
Characterization of a polycrystalline sample of Bi4O4S3 indicated that the lower and upper 
critical fields (Hc1 and Hc2) are approximately 15 Oe and 31 kOe,3) respectively, but a much smaller Hc1 
of ~7.0 Oe has been reported in another study.1)  However, regardless of the small variations in the 
superconducting properties of Bi4O4S3, ongoing studies reveal a large superconducting shielding 
fraction and zero resistivity.  Bi4O4S3 crystallizes in a tetragonal structure with the I4/mmm space 
group (at room temperature).  There is a slight discrepancy in the lattice parameters reported for this 
compound: a = 3.9592(1) Å and c = 41.241(1) Å in ref. 1; a = 3.978 Å and c = 41.07 Å in ref. 2; and a 
= 3.9697(2) Å and c = 41.3520(1) Å in ref. 3.  Because the above-mentioned differences between the 
values of a and c are less than 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively, it is difficult to establish a reasonable 
correlation among the lattice parameters and the reported superconducting properties.   
To reveal the comprehensive SC properties of Bi4O4S3, we attempted to grow a high-quality 
single crystal of Bi4O4S3.  We adopted a high-pressure (HP) method because the extremely low 
melting points of Bi (272 °C; boiling point: 1564 °C) and S (115.2 °C; boiling point: 444.7 °C) render 
crystal growth by the conventional methods at ambient pressure (AP) difficult.  Although a 
high-quality single crystal has not yet been grown, we surprisingly found that the polycrystalline 
Bi4O4S3 known to date shows most likely impurity-driven SC, in sharp contrast to the observations 
2 
 


made in ongoing studies.  Although the compound turns out to be SC with zero resistivity on cooling 
to 1.5 K, SC has only a 0.3% shielding fraction at most in magnetization (100% is expected for an ideal 
bulk SC), indicating that the SC unlikely reflects the bulk nature of the BiS2 layered phase.  An 
electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) suggested that a Bi-rich and S-poor compound, which is 
possibly amorphous, might be responsible for the observed SC.   
We also found that a similar superconducting impurity might complicate the ongoing studies on 
SC of the Bi4O4S3 compound prepared by a normal process because its full shielding fraction was 
markedly decreased to less than 1/14 of that of the pellet even upon gentle grinding.  The London 
penetration depth (λL) and relative sample size unlikely accounted for the marked reduction.  This was 
supported by the fact that even a much weaker applied magnetic field of 1 Oe (<<Hc1) did not improve 
the reduced shielding fraction.  Instead, the mechanical break of a superconducting link thinly spread 
throughout the grain boundaries and at the surface in a synthesized pellet more reasonably accounted 
for the marked decrease.  In the present paper, we report the results of more detailed measurements of 
Bi4O4S3 compounds, which were synthesized in the HP and normal processes, under various conditions 
using both bulk pellet and powder forms.  
2. Experimental  
Polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 was prepared from fine Bi2O3 (99.99%; Soekawa Chemical Co., 
Tokyo), Bi2S3 (99.9%; Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co., Sakado), and S (99.99%; Kojundo Chemical Lab. 
Co.) powders.  The above-mentioned powders were mixed in a stoichiometric molecular ratio and 
placed in a cubic multianvil HP apparatus.  Then, they were heated at a specific temperature between 
500 and 900 °C for 30 min at an elevated pressure of 3 GPa and quenched to room temperature before 
releasing the pressure.  The temperature was monitored by a W:Re5-W:Re26 thermocouple during 
heating.  The mixture was sealed in a Pt capsule and separated from Pt by a hexagonal boron nitride 
inner cell.  The inner cell did not react with the mixture components, as was evident from its 
unchanged color (white) after heating.  For reference, Bi powder (99.9%; Kojundo Chemical Lab. 
Co.) was heated under the same conditions at 700 °C for 30 min.  For comparison, polycrystalline 
3 
 


Bi4O4S3 was prepared by the normal method reported previously.1–3)  The stoichiometric mixture was 
pressed into a pellet and heated at 450 °C for 10 h in an evacuated quartz tube.   
All the as-prepared compounds were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis under 
ambient conditions in an X’Pert Pro system (PANalytical) using monochromatic Cu-Kα radiation.  
Selected compounds were subjected to XRD Rietveld analysis using RIETAN-FP software 6 and 
EPMA in JXA-8500F from JEOL.  The XRD data for structure refinement were recorded in a 
RIGAKU X-ray diffractometer at room temperature ranging from 10–120° in 2θ at a step interval of 
0.03° using Cu-Ka radiation. The current and voltage needed to generate the X-ray were 40 mA and 40 
kV, respectively.  Magnetic susceptibility (χ) measurements were performed using a magnetic 
property measurement system (MPMS, Quantum Design) in the temperature range of 2–300 K and at 
an applied magnetic field of 1 Oe or 10 Oe or 10 kOe, under field-cooling (FC) and zero-field-cooling 
(ZFC) conditions.  The electrical resistivity (ρ) of the polycrystalline pellets was measured by a 
physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) at temperatures between 2 and 300 K.  
The conventional four-terminal method was used for this purpose; the ac-gauge current and frequency 
were 1 or 2 mA and 110 Hz, respectively.  Silver epoxy was used to fix gold wires onto the pellets for 
the ρ measurements.  Additional measurements for χ and ρ were conducted down to 1.6 and 1.4 K in 
an MPMS VSM (Quantum Design) and a 3He probe in PPMS, respectively, for a piece of a selected 
sample pellet.   
3. Results and Discussion  
All the major XRD peaks for the sample prepared at 700 °C were assigned by assuming a 
tetragonal unit cell with the I4/mmm space group (Fig. 1), as in other ongoing studies.1–3)  The lattice 
parameters a = 3.9592(1) Å and c = 41.241(1) Å were comparable with the previously reported values.  
When the heating temperature was increased to 900 °C, a different XRD profile was observed, 
indicating the transformation of the tetragonal phase into an unidentified phase.  On the other hand, 
the compounds synthesized at temperatures lower than 700 °C contained a small amount of the 
tetragonal phase and Bi metal and multiple impurities.  In the present study, 700 °C was identified as 
4 
 


the nearly optimal temperature for synthesizing polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 at 3 GPa, while 500–510 °C 
was the optimal temperature range at AP.1–3)  Interestingly, the same XRD profile was obtained even 
after a week for the powder synthesized at 3 GPa, suggesting that Bi4O4S3 synthesized by the HP 
method is chemically stable under ambient conditions, as is the powder synthesized by the normal 
process.1–3)   
To refine the structure parameters of the HP compound Bi4O4S3, Rietveld analysis was 
conducted, and the results are summarized in Table I and Fig. 2(a). The R factors for the refinements 
imply that the structure model mentioned above is indeed reasonable for the HP compound Bi4O4S3. 
Meanwhile, the results indicate that small amounts of impurities are mixed in the compound. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to identify the impurities in this study.  In the refinement, the S3 and 
O2 sites were assumed to be partially occupied and fixed to the Bi4O4S3 composition.3  Note that the 
O2 coordinate parameters y and z could not be refined because only a quarter of the O2 site was 
occupied; hence the parameters y and z of O2 were fixed to those obtained in a preliminary refinement 
with the assumption that the O2 occupancy factor is 0.5.  We also tested a similar structure model 
proposed in Ref. 1, where the site occupancies of S3 and O2 were fixed to be 1 and 0.5, respectively.  
The alternative model, however, did not help to improve the refinement quality.  Perhaps, a neutron 
diffraction study can refine the structure parameters further.   
Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show a comparison of the coordination environment of Bi in the BiS2 
layer between the Bi4O4S3 phases prepared by the HP method and a normal method.  A significant 
difference is not obvious; however, the length of the S1–Bi2 bond, which is perpendicular to the BiS2 
layer, is approximately 4% shorter in the HP phase than that in the AP phase (2.66 and 2.77 Å, 
respectively).  Note that the interlayer distances between the BiS2 layers were 3.19(1) Å for the 
HP-prepared Bi4O4S3 and 3.24(1) for the normally prepared Bi4O4S3 (ref. 1), indicating a trivial 
change.   
The superconducting properties of Bi4O4S3 prepared by the normal method were studied for 
reference.  Magnetic measurements clearly showed a superconducting transition with a notable 
5 
 


shielding fraction (~129%, see the ZFC curve in Fig. 3) (the density of the compound was 6.11 g/cm3, 
which was measured), as reported in ongoing studies.1-3)  The slight overestimation of the fraction was 
probably due to the demagnetizing effect, because the measurement was conducted on a sintered pellet.  
The ρ vs T curve for the polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 pellet (inset of Fig. 3) shows a metallic character in 
the normal state and a sharp drop to zero, as reported previously.1-3)  Thereafter, the pellet was gently 
ground to an amount of loose powder using an agate mortar and pestle and re-subjected to magnetic 
measurements.  Noticeably, the shielding fraction decreased to less than 1/14 of that of the pellet.  To 
our best knowledge, the radical decrease in the shielding fraction has not been mentioned in the 
literatures thus far.1-3)  Note that the chemical and mechanical instabilities of Bi4O4S3 were unlikely 
responsible for the radical decrease because the XRD pattern was essentially unchanged over the 
measurements.  The radical decrease seemingly indicated that a superconducting link was physically 
destroyed by grinding.  We discuss a possible origin of the radical decrease later.   
Figure 4 shows the χ–T data measured at a weak magnetic field of 10 Oe for the compounds 
synthesized under HP conditions in a variety of heating temperatures.  The powders used in the XRD 
measurements were reused in the magnetic susceptibility measurements.  The desired amount of each 
loose powder sample was set in a sample holder and subjected to the χ–T measurements.  The sample 
prepared at 650 °C showed a notable diamagnetic transition, presumably a superconducting transition, 
at 4 K.  However, the superconducting shielding fraction was less than 2.2% at the low-temperature 
limit (the density of the compound was assumed to be 7.84 g/cm3, which corresponded to the calculated 
density).  Note that identical measurements of a pellet (instead of the powder) revealed a comparable 
shielding fraction, being in stark contrast to the full shielding fraction reported for compounds prepared 
by the normal process in other ongoing studies.1–3)   
Because the compound prepared at 650 °C contained a small amount of Bi4O4S3, we 
investigated the rest of the compounds in the same manner to confirm the reported SC for Bi4O4S3.  
Surprisingly, the nearly single phase Bi4O4S3 prepared at 700 °C showed negligible anomaly in the χ–T 
curves, similarly to the reference material of Bi and the compound prepared at 900 °C.  Thus, the 
6 
 


magnetic data suggested the absence of the bulk SC in Bi4O4S3 synthesized at 3 GPa.  Unfortunately, 
a systematic correlation between the superconducting properties and the synthesis conditions was 
hardly established, and the superconducting volume fraction was just 2.2% at best in the 
HP-synthesized samples. It was therefore highly challenging to identify the phase responsible for the 
observed SC in the HP-synthesized samples.   
The inset of Fig. 4 shows the χ–T curves measured under a much stronger magnetic field of 10 
kOe for the near-single-phase Bi4O4S3 (synthesized at 700 °C).  The curves were almost 
temperature-independent, and a small Curie–Weiss-like upturn, which was indicative of an impurity 
contribution, was found in the low-temperature limit.  The upturn part was much smaller than that 
reported in previous studies of Bi4O4S3,2) indicating the improved quality of the present compound.  
Furthermore, the temperature-independent χ0 was comparable to that determined in an ongoing study 
(0.736 × 10-3 emu mol-1 Oe-1).2)  Because Bi4O4S3 is metallic in nature, the aforementioned similarity 
in χ0 implied that the densities of states at the Fermi level were comparable in the two cases.   
For further characterization, the ρ–T curve of the nearly single phase Bi4O4S3 (synthesized at 
700 °C) was measured (Fig. 5) down to 1.4 K.  The data revealed that the compound shows metallic 
behavior over the measured temperature range; the room-temperature ρ was approximately 0.8 mΩ-cm.  
This feature was qualitatively and quantitatively similar to that observed for Bi4O4S3 in ongoing studies.  
A broad drop, which was indicative of a superconducting transition, was observed at temperatures 
below 4 K (see inset), and zero resistivity was confirmed at a temperature of 1.6 K.  To confirm the 
superconducting shielding fraction at the zero-resistivity temperature, the measured pellet was again 
studied by χ measurements and the superconducting shielding fraction was confirmed to be smaller 
than 0.3% even at 1.6 K (Fig. 6).  Note that the χ measurements were conducted on the same pellet 
used for the ρ–T measurements (the pellet was not ground).  The extremely small superconducting 
shielding fraction was thus in sharp contrast to the bulk SC observed for Bi4O4S3 in ongoing studies.1–3)  
The zero resistivity observed and the trivial superconducting volume fraction (<0.3%) in the χ–T curve 
provide evidence of the impurity-driven SC of Bi4O4S3 synthesized by the HP method at temperatures 
7 
 


exceeding 1.6 K.  The extremely small-volume SC (<0.3%) showing zero resistivity is likely caused 
by a trivial superconducting link, which is thinly spread out throughout the grain boundaries and at the 
surface in a synthesized pellet.  Unidentified amorphous thin impurities or altered surfaces of particles 
of Bi4O4S3 are possible causes of the impurity-driven SC observed for the HP-prepared pellet.  We 
investigated the possible impurities.   
As the present results appeared to contradict the claim for the discovery of bulk SC in 
Bi4O4S3,1–3) we attempted to identify any possible contribution by the nonstoichiometry of Bi4O4S3 to 
the superconducting properties.  Hence, starting mixtures with S-deficient compositions (10 and 20 
at.%) were tested under the optimized synthesis conditions.  However, there were no detectable 
changes in the lattice parameters and magnetic properties (see Fig. 4), indicating that defect structures 
were not formed in Bi4O4S3.  Similar results were obtained for O-deficient starting compositions and 
S-rich starting compositions.  Since the sample is chemically stable, as mentioned earlier in the text, 
decomposition between the time of synthesis and the time of measurement is unlikely to be a cause of 
the absence of bulk SC.  Hence, a possible factor that could account for the impurity-driven SC in the 
present compound is an undetected difference: for instance, Bi4O4S3 prepared at 3 GPa may not be 
identical to that prepared by the normal process.  The local coordination of the structure may be 
slightly altered in the former case.   
To identify the superconducting impurity, polished surfaces of the Bi4O4S3 compounds 
synthesized by the HP method and the normal method were investigated by EPMA.  Figures 7(a) and 
7(b) show composition images (indicated by CP) and element maps (S, O, and Bi) at the same 
magnification.  The pellet synthesized by the HP method was much denser than the other, reflecting 
the measured densities of ~6.94 g/cm3 (89% of the calculated density for Bi4O4S3) and ~6.11 g/cm3 
(78%) for the pellets synthesized by the HP process and normal process, respectively.  Moreover, the 
EPMA results indicated that the bright part is relatively more sulfur deficient and Bi rich than Bi4O4S3.  
Note that the bright part does not correspond to electric charging in the insulating state because it is a 
composition image.  Since the bright parts were confirmed to exist throughout the grain boundaries 
8 
 


and at the surface of Bi4O4S3 prepared by the normal method, it is reasonable to attribute the 
superconducting impurity to the bright parts.  We thus attempted to identify the parts by XRD analysis 
and EPMA; however, the studies were unsuccessful probably because the parts were either amorphous 
or thinly spread out.  Perhaps, the extremely low melting points of starting materials (Bi melting 
point: 272 °C and S melting point: 115.2 °C) may play a key role in forming the bright parts in the 
heating process; partially melted phases may be included in the chemical reaction paths to form the 
bright parts.   
The present EPMA and XRD data indicated that the various forms of impurities could play a 
fundamental role in the zero resistivity observed for the HP- and normal-process-prepared samples.  
Under the synthesis conditions adopted in ongoing studies, the superconducting impurity might form a 
link unexpectedly in the Bi4O4S3 pellet.  This link could be responsible for zero resistivity as well as 
for the full superconducting volume fraction, as was evidenced by the marked decrease in the shielding 
fraction even upon gentle grinding.  The impurity-driven SC in the HP-synthesized Bi4O4S3 
compound was presumably present because the trivial amount of superconducting impurity (as 
evidenced by the shielding fraction of the pellet smaller than 0.3%) forms a comparable link.  Recent 
specific heat measurements of a full superconducting compound showed only negligible anomaly at Tc, 
which seemed to support the idea of the impurity-driven SC.7)  Although we were unsuccessful in 
identifying the superconducting impurity, we could at least conclude that the impurity drove SC with 
zero resistivity above 1.6 K for the layered oxysulfide Bi4O4S3 compound synthesized by the HP 
method.  It is likely that a similar superconducting impurity complicates ongoing studies of the SC of 
Bi4O4S3 prepared by the normal process because its shielding fraction is markedly decreased to less 
than 1/14 of that of the pellet even upon gentle grinding.   
We investigated the superconducting parameters, which were reported for Bi4O4S3 in ongoing 
studies.  Magnetic measurements in ref. 3 showed that Hc1 at 2 K was ~15 Oe and that the lower 
critical field (Hc2) at 0 K was 31 kOe.  The coherence length (ξGL) at T = 0 was then estimated to be 
~10 nm, which was nearly comparable to that of MgB2 and much longer than those of Fe-based and 
9 
 


cuprate superconductors (typically a few nm).8)  According to the parameters, we could roughly

scale of the pellet, which was used to measure the magnetic properties in this study.  The HP-prepared 
pellet has the minimum scale dimension of ~1 mm, which was much larger than λL; thus, the sample 
scale unlikely impacted the magnetic measurements.  The ground sample for the normally prepared 
sample has average dimensions of powders of a few 10 µm (confirmed by optical microscopy).  
Although the average dimension was still much larger than λL, we repeated the same magnetic 
measurements in a magnetic field of 1 Oe (<< Hc1) to test a possible impact from the sample scale 
approaching λL [Figures 8(a) and 8(b)].  The results, however, showed no notable improvement in the 
superconducting shielding fraction of the ground sample of the normally prepared sample.  Thus, the 
relative sample scale to λL hardly accounted for the unusually smaller superconducting shielding 
fraction of the powder form.   
4. Conclusions   
In summary, we carried out magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements as 
well as electron microprobe analysis on Bi4O4S3, which has recently been claimed to be a bulk 
superconductor (Tc = 4.5 K).  Quality-improved polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 was successfully prepared by 
an HP method, and the lattice parameters and normal-state ρ, as well as the density of states at the 
Fermi level, were found to be comparable to those determined previously.  The most notable 
discovery in this study was the impurity-driven SC (>1.6 K) in Bi4O4S3, which contradicted the results 
of ongoing studies of this compound.  There are two possible reasons for the above-mentioned 
discrepancy: (i) common technical errors, including those related to the presence of a superconducting 
impurity, in ongoing studies.  The impurity was found to show zero resistivity, even though its 
superconducting shielding fraction was smaller than 0.3%; (ii) slight local structure and chemical 
composition differences between the HP phase and the superconducting phase of Bi4O4S3, including a 
small variation of the S1–Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer, as detected in this study.  The concentrations of 
10 
 


vacancies of the SO4 group in the layered structure of Bi4O4S3 might also vary upon HP heating.  If 
the latter is true, the HP phase can be a host material for the superconducting phase.   
Although we cannot discuss the possible structure or composition variations of Bi4O4S3 in more 
detail because neutron diffraction studies are required, we conclude that the SC of the HP-prepared 
Bi4O4S3 is most likely impurity-driven.  The relative sample scale to the λL hardly accounted for the 
negligible superconducting shielding fraction, as evidenced by the magnetic susceptibility 
measurements at a magnetic field of 1 Oe as well as of 10 Oe on a mm-size HP sample.  Hence, the 
full shielding fraction reported in ongoing studies1–3) was possibly complicated by a superconducting 
link consisting of similar superconducting impurities throughout the grain boundaries and at the surface 
in a synthesized pellet as evidenced by marked decreases in the shielding fraction at a magnetic field of 
1 Oe (<< Hc1) even upon gentle grinding.   
Although the various forms of the superconducting link could play a fundamental role in the 
observed SC, it was highly challenging to identify the chemical composition and structure of the 
superconducting impurities because partially melted phases can be essential in the formation of the 
superconducting link (Bi melting point: 272 °C and S melting point: 115.2 °C).  Although the Bi 
powder treated in the same heating procedure as the reference was not superconducting above 2 K, 
multiple phases were superconducting at the highest Tc of 8.2 K.10)  Thus, neighbor materials in solid 
and amorphous forms should be carefully studied for relevance to the observed SC.  In addition, the 
surface of the BiS2 layered phase might be altered under the presence of liquid phases during the 
heating process, resulting in the appearance of possible surface superconductivity.  No matter which, 
the observed superconductivity did not truly reflect the bulk nature of the BiS2 layered phase, 
regardless of the manner in which the Bi4O4S3 compound is synthesized.  Since the difficulty in 
identifying the superconducting impurities complicates ongoing studies, further experimental efforts 
toward measuring the degree of impact from impurities and possible altered particle surfaces on the 
observed SC would be needed to correctly characterize the BiS2 layered phase.

Fig. 1. (Color online) Powder XRD patterns of a series of Bi4O4S3 compounds prepared by the HP 
method.  The heating temperatures used for each powder sample are indicated in the figure.  The 
reference pattern for Bi4O4S3 sample prepared under AP at 450 ºC is shown at the bottom.  
Characteristic peaks for the tetragonal Bi4O4S3 phase are labeled using Miller indices in the pattern for 
700 ºC as a representative.  Solid squares indicate the peaks due to impurities.  For clarity, commas 
are used to separate the numbers in some indices.   
Fig. 2. (Color online) (a) Rietveld analysis of the XRD pattern of the Bi4O4S3 compound prepared by 
the HP method. Markers and solid lines show the observed and calculated profiles, respectively, and 
the difference is shown at the bottom. The Bragg reflections are denoted by tick marks. (b) Local 
structure coordination of Bi in the BiS2 layer, drawn on the basis of the present refinement results.  
The numbers inside are bond distances in Å and angles in degrees.  (c) Corresponding local structure 
view for Bi4O4S3 synthesized by a normal method for comparison. The structure data were cited from 
ref. 1.   
Fig. 3. (Color online) T dependence of χ for Bi4O4S3 prepared under AP.  For comparison, 
measurements were performed on an as-made pellet and gently ground powder.  The largest shielding 
fraction of approximately 126% was observed for the pellet.  The insets show the T dependence of ρ 
for the as-made pellet of Bi4O4S3 (AP).   
Fig. 4. T dependence of χ for the compounds prepared under various heating conditions at 3 GPa.  
The set of curves for each compound includes the ZFC and FC curves measured at a magnetic field of 
10 Oe.  The data for the Bi reference material (annealed at 700 °C and 3 GPa) are plotted as well.  
The largest shielding fraction calculated using a material density of 7.84 g/cm3 is 2.2% at most.  The 
inset shows the T dependence of χ for the single-phase polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 under a large magnetic 
field of 10 kOe.

Fig. 5. (Color online) T dependence of ρ for polycrystalline pellet of Bi4O4S3 (HP).  The inset shows 
an enlarged view of the low-temperature part (<7 K).   
Fig. 6. (Color online) T dependence of χ for gently ground powder of Bi4O4S3 prepared under 
high-pressure conditions of 3 GPa and 700 °C.  The ZFC and FC curves were measured under a 
magnetic field of 10 Oe.  Note that the shielding fraction, calculated using a material density of 7.84 
g/cm3, is 0.3% at most at the lowest temperature, where zero resistivity was confirmed before grinding.  
The inset shows an enlarged view of the plots.   
Fig. 7. (Color online) Comparison of composition image and elemental maps of S, O, and Bi in EMPA 
for the polished surfaces of Bi4O4S3 synthesized under (a) AP and (b) HP conditions.  
Fig. 8. (Color online) T dependence of χ for the Bi4O4S3 compounds prepared under (a) AP and (b) 
HP conditions measured at an applied magnetic field of 1 Oe.  For comparison, measurements were 
performed on an as-made pellet and gently ground powder.
