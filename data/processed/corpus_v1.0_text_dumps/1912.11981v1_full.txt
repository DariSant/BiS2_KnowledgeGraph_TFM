Abstract 
La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a layered Bi-based oxychalcogenide with a thick four-layer-type 
conducting layer. Although La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a structural analogue of La2O2Bi3AgS6, 
which is a superconductor, insulating behavior has been observed in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 at 
low temperatures, and no superconductivity has been reported. Herein, we demonstrate 
superconductivity in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex via partial substitution of Se in the S sites. 
Owing to the Se doping, the normal state electrical resistivity of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex at 
low temperatures was dramatically suppressed, and superconductivity was observed at a 
transition temperature (Tc) of 1.15 K for x = 0.5. Tc increased with increasing Se 
concentration: Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0. The emergence of metallicity and superconductivity 
was explained via in-plane chemical pressure effects that can suppress local disorder and 
carrier localization, which are commonly observed in two-layer-type BiS2-based systems.  
 
Keywords: BiCh2-based superconductors; layered superconductor; electrical resistivity; substitution effect.

INTRODUCTION 
Layered compounds have been widely studied in the search for new superconductors since the discovery of (high-
transition-temperature) high-Tc cuprates [1]. After the cuprates, Fe-based and BiCh2-based superconductors (Ch: S 
and Se) have been discovered, and many others have been synthesized [2-5]. In those layered superconductors, the 
important structure is a superconducting layer commonly contained in the layer stacking: a CuO2 layer in cuprates 
and an FeAs or FeSe layer in Fe-based superconductors [6-8]. In BiCh2-based superconductors, a BiCh2 layer is the 
basic superconducting layer [3-5].  
Since the discovery of BiS2-based superconductors, namely, Bi4O4S3 and La(O,F)BiS2, in 2012 [3,4], many related 
superconductors with BiS2[9-18], BiSe2 [19,20], or Bi(S,Se)2 superconducting layers [21-24] have been synthesized. 
The crystal structure of BiCh2-based compounds has an interesting feature, that is, the presence of a van der Waals 
gap between two BiCh2 layers. The space in this gap could be used to create new BiCh2-type compounds with a thick 
conducting layer [25-27].  
As studied in cuprates, stacking many conducting planes along the c-axis could be a promising way to achieve a 
higher Tc in a layered system [6,28,29]. Hence, layered oxychalcogenides, such as La2O2M4S6 (M: metals like Bi, Pb, 
Sn, and Ag), with a thicker four-layer-type conducting layer of M4S6 have been synthesized with the expectation of 
demonstrating a higher Tc than that observed in two-layer-type BiCh2-based superconductors [25-27]. The four-layer-
type La2O2M4S6 compounds typically have a tetragonal structure with a space group of P4/nmm. The structure can be 
regarded as a stacking of La2O2, BiS2, M2S2, and BiS2 layers in sequence [26]; a crystal structure image for M = Pb 
is displayed in Fig. 1(d). A  rock-salt-type M2S2 layer is inserted between two BiS2 layers where a van der Waals gap 
would exist in a two-layer-type LaOBiS2 (described as La2O2Bi2S4 for one unit cell). In fact, the outer layers are 
basically BiS2 layers, and the inner rock-salt layer is occupied by M and S ions. From a structural viewpoint, the 
composition can be described as La2O2Bi2M2S6.  
Recently, we observed superconductivity with a Tc of 0.5 K in La2O2Bi3AgS6 (M = Bi0.5Ag0.5) [30].  Furthermore, 
we have studied the effects of doping on the superconductivity of the La2O2Bi3AgS6 system. Partial substitution of 
Ag by Sn increased Tc up to 2.5 K in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6 [31]. Additionally, partial Se substitution for S resulted in 
bulk superconductivity at 3.5 K in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 [31]. Tc further increased up to 4.0 K with RE-site 
substitution in La2-xRExO2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6 (RE = Eu, Nd, and Pr) compounds [32,33]. Based on these recent 
developments with regard to new four-layer-type Bi-based superconductors, we found that the chemical pressure 
effect was useful for inducing bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi2M2S6 systems. The chemical pressure effect has 
been proposed as one of the essential parameters for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in typical BiCh2-based 
compounds [14,21-24,34]. In the RE(O,F)BiCh2 system, in-plane chemical pressure, which was tuned by RE-site 
and/or Ch-site substitutions, suppresses in-plane local disorder, which is unfavorable for the emergence of bulk 
superconductivity [35-39]. As mentioned previously, four-layer-type La2O2Bi2M2S6 compounds are also sensitive to 
chemical pressure effects. Therefore, the chemical pressure could be useful for further exploration of new four-layer-
type superconductors.  
In this study, we have investigated the effects of substituting Se in the S sites in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6, which was the 
first four-layer-type compound synthesized by Sun et al. and proposed as a promising thermoelectric material [25]. 
Although theoretical calculations suggested that La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a metal [26], the obtained samples showed 
insulating behavior at low temperatures [25]. We have investigated the effects of partial substitutions of the Pb sites 
by Ag, Cd, In, Sn, and Sb, but all of the examined samples showed insulating characteristics at low temperatures. 
Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the effects of substituting Se in the S sites in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. Owing 
to the Se substitution, the insulating behavior was suppressed, and electrical resistivity that was apparently lower than 
that of pure La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 was observed even at the lowest temperature of our system (T = 0.4 K). We observed 
superconductivity at Tc = 1.15 K for x = 0.5 and Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
Polycrystalline samples of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0) were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. 
Powders of La2S3 (99.99%), Bi2O3 (99.9%), Pb (99.99%), and grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Bi2Se3 (pre-
synthesized from Bi and Se) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0) were mixed using 
a pestle and a mortar, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 690 °C for 15 h. The heated samples 
were reground, pelletized, and heated at 740 °C for 35 h. The optimal annealing conditions and the phase purity of 
the prepared samples were examined using laboratory X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation by a 
conventional -2 method. To discuss the lattice structure, Rietveld analyses were performed with RIETAN-FP [40]. 
We assumed perfect site selectivity of Bi and Pb based on the previous structural analyses for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 [26]. 
As the obtained XRD intensity and profile were not sufficient for the determination of displacement parameters, we 
have performed refinements with fixed isotropic displacement parameters. A schematic image of the crystal structure 
was drawn using VESTA [41]. The actual composition of the synthesized samples was investigated by energy 
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on a scanning electron microscope SEM [TM-3030 (Hitachi)]. The electrical 
resistivity down to T = 0.5 K was measured by a four-probe method using a 3He probe platform on the Physical 
Property measurement system (PPMS: Quantum Design). The Seebeck coefficient was measured by a four-probe 
method at room temperature on ZEM-3 (advance RIKO). The temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient was 
measured with a standard five-prove configuration on PPMS. 
 
 
 
 
III. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Figure 1(a) shows room temperature powder XRD patterns for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0, 0.5, and 1.0) compounds. 
The obtained samples are crystalized in a tetragonal crystal structure with a space group of P4/nmm. For all the 
samples, the main phase was La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. As indicated by the symbol, a La2O2S impurity phase was observed. 
The impurity phase did not disappear when heat treatment conditions were changed. We performed two-phase 
Rietveld analyses to determine lattice constants for all the obtained samples. The results of the Rietveld refinement 
are summarized in Table I. The lattice constants a and c increase with Se substitution for x = 0.5, but the lattice 
constants for x = 1.0 were comparable to those for x = 0.5. Those shifts in lattice constants are consistent with the 
observed peak shifts, as shown in Fig. 1(b,c). Based on such facts, we consider the solubility limit of Se in S to be 
less than x = 1.0. We have analyzed the actual compositions of elements at the conducting layer in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-
xSex (x = 0, 0.5 and 1.0) by EDX analysis at five analysis points (Table I). The obtained compositions for the sample 
are almost the same as the initial nominal compositions, but the Se concentration for x = 1.0 is slightly lower than the 
nominal value. However, the Se concentrations were different for the samples with x = 0.5 and 1.0, and the 
superconducting property was also different. Therefore, for clarity to the readers, we labelled the samples according 
to the initial nominal compositions in this paper.  
Figure 1(e) shows the result of Rietveld refinement for x = 0.5. To refine the XRD pattern for an Se-doped sample,  
we needed to determine the S site where Se is doped. The inset of Fig. 1(e) shows the reliability factor Rwp obtained 
for the cases with no Se and those with Se-doped S1, S2, and S3 sites [see Fig. 1(d) for the label of S sites]. Rwp 
decreases with incorporation of Se at the S sites and becomes the lowest when Se substitution at the in-plane S1 site 
was assumed. Although we need further detailed structural parameters to draw firm conclusions regarding the Se-
doping site, herein, we consider that Se was selectively substituted at the S1 site. This assumption is consistent with 
the emergence of metallic conductivity and superconductivity in Se-doped samples, which can be explained by the 
concept of in-plane chemical pressure via Se substitution at the S1 sites of BiS2 layers [21-24,34].

     Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] from 300 to 2 K for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6. 
The electrical resistivity largely increases with decreasing temperature, which in agreement with the typical behavior 
of semiconductors. The result is consistent with a previous report by Sun et al. [25]. However, the band calculation 
has suggested a metallic band structure for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 [26]. The inconsistency may imply that the semiconducting-
like behavior of electrical resistivity is caused by anomalous carrier localization, not from characteristics of a band 
insulator. 
Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] from 300 to 0.5 K for the Se-doped 
La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0.5 and 1.0) samples. At 300 K, the electrical resistivity is clearly lower than that of 
La2O2Bi2Pb2S6. Furthermore, the semiconducting-like behavior was dramatically suppressed by Se substitution. The 
normal-state resistivity of Se-doped compounds still shows a slight increase with decreasing temperature, which may 
be due to weak carrier localization, which is typically observed in BiS2-based systems. The weak carrier localization 
seems to be suppressed with increasing Se concentration from x = 0.5 to x = 1.0. The changes in resistivity caused by 
Se substitution can be understood by the effects of in-plane chemical pressure, which was introduced previously. For 
two-layer-type BiCh2-based compounds, it has been extensively demonstrated that in-plane chemical pressure effects 
successfully suppressed the in-plane local disorder of the conducting layer [14,21-24,34]. Thus, we consider that the 
semiconducting-like behavior observed for x = 0 and the weak localization behavior observed for Se-doped samples 
are both related to the presence of local disorders in the BiS2 layers in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. We observed 
superconductivity in both the Se-doped samples, as shown in Fig. 3(b), which is the zoomed view of Fig. 3(a) near 


6 
 
the superconducting transition region. Tc increases with increasing Se concentration in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. The zero-
resistivity Tc (Tczero) is 1.15 K for x = 0.5 and 1.90 K for x = 1.0. Thus far, superconductivity in La2O2Bi2M2S6 has 
been observed for La2O2Bi3AgS6-based compounds [30-33]. La2O2Bi3AgS6 exhibits metallic conductivity without Se 
substitution but shows a CDW-like (charge density wave-like) anomaly in ρ(T). Although the origin of the anomaly 
has not been clarified, it could be related to the anomalous insulating behavior observed in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6. The 
emergence of metallic conductivity and superconductivity via Se substitution in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex could provide us 
with important information for the further development of four-layer-type Bi-based superconductors. 
Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity under various magnetic fields 
[ρ(T,B)] for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0.5 and 1.0). Tc shifts towards a lower temperature with an increase in the 
magnetic field. We observed an onset drop in the resistivity due to the superconductivity even at B = 2 T for x = 1.0. 
The Tc onset shifts gradually with an increasing magnetic field as opposed to the shift in Tczero, which is the 
characteristic behavior of layered superconductivity against the magnetic field. The magnetic field-temperature phase 
diagrams are plotted in Fig. 4(c). The upper critical fields are estimated based on the temperature where resistivity 
becomes 90% of the normal-state resistivity near Tc. The upper critical field Bc2(T) at absolute zero temperature, Bc2(0), 
is analyzed using the conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation [42], which gives 
Bc2(0) =-0.693Tc(dBc2/dT)T=Tc. Bc2(0) is 0.76 and 1.15 T for x = 0.5 and 1.0, respectively.  
To investigate the changes in carrier concentration, Seebeck coefficient (S) and Hall coefficient were measured 
for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. As shown in Fig. 5, the Seebeck coefficient is negative, which indicates that the dominant 
carriers are electrons. The absolute value of S decreases from x = 0 to x = 0.5. Seebeck coefficient for x = 0.5 and 1.0 
is almost the same. From the results, we can roughly estimate that the carrier concentration slightly increased by Se 
substitution. Fig. 6(a) shows the temperature dependence of Hall coefficient (-RH) from 2 K to 300 K under the fixed 
magnetic field of 9 T for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0 and 0.5). Hall coefficients are all negative, which is consistent 
with the results of Seebeck coefficient, but -RH for x = 0.5 is largely suppressed as compared to that for x = 0. To 
investigate the carrier density we have used the simple  single band modle n = |1/eRH| , where n is the charge carrier 
density and e is the electron charge, as demonstrated for other layered Bi-based compounds [25,43,44]. Figure 6 (b) 
shows the temperature dependences of electron carrier density for La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex (x = 0 and 0.5), which suggests 
that  the carriers density increases by Se substitution. Having considered the valence state of S and Se, which is 
considered as -2 for both, we do not expect a huge change in carrier concentration. Thus, the huge increase in carrier 
density may be related to the in-plane chemical pressure effects. As a fact, metalicity has been induced by Se 
substitution. From those facts, we consider that the huge change in carrier concentration estimated here is related to 
the increase in the concentration of mobile carrier. With this assumption, low carrier density for x = 0 can be 
considered as resulting from carrier localization due to the local disorder in the BiS2 layers.

SUMMARY 
La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a four-layer-type Bi-based compound that shows insulating transport properties at low 
temperatures. Hence, in this study, we have investigated the effects of Se substitution on the structural, transport, and 
superconducting properties of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. Owing to Se doping, the normal state electrical resistivity at low 
temperatures was drastically suppressed, and superconductivity at a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.15 K was 
observed for x = 0.5. Tc increased with increasing Se concentration: Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0. According to XRD analyses, 
we proposed that Se was substituted for the in-plane S1 site in the BiS2 layers. Both the Seebeck coefficient and the 


9 
 
Hall coefficient suggested that electrons were the dominant carriers. From the Hall coefficient, carrier concentration 
was estimated. Owing to Se substitution, the concentration of mobile carriers increased considerably; this could be 
related to the suppression of carrier localization caused by Se substitution. On the basis of the obtained results and 
the discussion based on the analogy of two-layer-type systems, the emergence of metallicity and superconductivity 
was explained by the in-plane chemical pressure effects. The estimated Bc2(0) was 0.76 and 1.15 T for x = 0.5 and 1.0, 
respectively. The demonstration of metallicity and superconductivity in La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-based compounds can be 
useful for further development of four-layer-type Bi-based superconductors.
