The magnetic penetration depth λ as a function of temperature in Bi4O4S3 was studied by
muon-spin-spectroscopy measurements. The superﬂuid density of Bi4O4S3 is found to be very low.
The dependence of λ−2 on temperature possibly suggests the existence of two s-wave type energy
gaps with the zero-temperature values of 0.93(3) and 0.09(4) meV. The upturn in the temperature
dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld close to Tc further supports multi-gap superconductivity in
Bi4O4S3. The presence of two superconducting energy gaps is consistent with theoretical and other
experimental studies. However, a single-gap s-wave model ﬁt with a gap of 0.88(2) meV can not be
ruled out completely. The value of λ(T ) at T = 0 K is estimated to be λ(0) = 861(17) nm, one of
the largest of all known layered superconductors, reﬂecting a very low superﬂuid density.

Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in su-
perconductivity within layered crystal structure com-
pounds.
The recent discovery of superconductivity in
the BiS2-based compound Bi4O4S3 [1, 2] with a transi-
tion temperature (Tc) of ≈4.5 K has further fostered
the research interest in layered superconductors. Exotic
superconductivity with higher Tc and/or with unconven-
tional pairing mechanism has often been found in ma-
terials with a layered crystal structure. In this context,
the most familiar examples are the high-Tc cuprates and
the Fe-based superconductors, where the corresponding
CuO2 or Fe2An2 (An = P, As, Se, Te) layer plays an im-
portant role in determining the superconducting prop-
erties [3–5]. Similarly, the BiS2 layer is believed to be
the basic building block for inducing superconductivity
in Bi4O4S3 and it is expected that the doping mecha-
nism resembles that of cuprates and Fe-based supercon-
ductors. This argument is supported by the discovery of
other BiS2-based superconductors ReO1−xFxBiS2 (Re =
La, Ce, Pr, and Nd) with Tc values of 10.6, 3.0, 5.5, and
5.6 K, respectively [6–9].
Up to now, only very few theoretical and experimen-
tal studies have been performed on Bi4O4S3. The parent
phase (Bi6O8S5) is a band insulator which becomes su-
perconducting after electron doping [1]. A ﬁrst principles
band structure calculation indicates that the supercon-
ductivity in Bi4O4S3 originates from two Bi 6p orbitals,
as they intersect the Fermi surface [10]. A RPA analy-
sis of a two-orbital model for the BiS2-based supercon-
ductors suggests that the spin ﬂuctuations promote com-
peting A1g and B2g superconducting states with similar
pairing strengths [11].
Transport measurements under
pressure reveal that Tc of Bi4O4S3 decreases monotoni-
cally without distinct change of the normal state metallic
behavior [12].
The exact nature of the superconduct-
ing state is still debated. Hall, Seebeck coeﬃcients, and
magnetoresistance measurements suggest exotic multi-
band features in Bi4O4S3 [13].
Recent measurements
of the temperature dependence of the magnetic pene-
tration depth λ using the tunnel diode oscillator tech-
nique [14] indicate a conventional s-wave type supercon-
ductivity in Bi4O4S3. However, the tunnel diode data
were collected only down to 1.6 K and hence remain
elusive in determining the true symmetry of the super-
conducting order parameter in Bi4O4S3. Other exper-
iments reported very strong coupling superconductivity
with ∆1(0)/kBTc ≈16.6 and with a large region of su-
perconducting ﬂuctuations above Tc surviving at large
magnetic ﬁelds [15] or impurity driven superconductivity
[16] In this respect it is important to characterize the su-
perconducting and magnetic properties of Bi4O4S3 at a
microscopic level and to obtain a detailed knowledge of
the superconducting order parameter over the full tem-
perature range.
In this Rapid Communication, we report on the results
of muon-spin rotation and relaxation (µSR) studies of
the magnetic penetration depth as a function of temper-
ature and on the symmetry of the superconducting gap
in the Bi4O4S3 superconductor. Our results show that
the superﬂuid density in Bi4O4S3 is very low. The ob-
served λ−2(T ) is found to be well described by a two-gap
s-wave model, as seen in many layered Fe-based super-
conductors. A single s-wave gap model is also able to give
a satisfactory ﬁt of the data, albeit with lower statisti-
cal signiﬁcance. For the two-gap model, the gap values at
absolute zero are ∆1(0) = 0.93(3), ∆2(0) = 0.09(4) meV,
respectively.
The corresponding gap to Tc ratios are
∆1(0)/kBTc = 2.38(7) and ∆2(0)/kBTc = 0.22(9). These
values are close to those obtained for various Fe-based su-
perconductors (see Ref. 33 and references therein). We
obtain the penetration depth, λ(0) = 861(17) nm.
Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared by

a solid state reaction method [1]. Sample characteriza-
tion measurements were performed at the Brookhaven
National Laboratory, USA. Transport measurements at
diﬀerent applied ﬁelds were performed at the Paul Scher-
rer Institute (PSI), Villigen, Switzerland. Zero-ﬁeld (ZF)
and transverse-ﬁeld (TF) µSR experiments were carried
out on the DOLLY and LTF µSR instruments, located
respectively at the πE1 and πM3 beamlines at PSI. The
sample in the form of a pressed pellet was mounted on
a copper fork-shaped sample holder in the DOLLY and
on a silver plate in the LTF instrument. The sample was
cooled from above Tc to base temperature at H = 0 dur-
ing ZF-µSR measurements and in a ﬁeld of 300 Oe in
TF-µSR measurements. The typical counting statistics
were ∼20 million muon decays per data point. The ZF-
and TF-µSR data were analyzed using the free software
package MUSRFIT [17].

dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld of Bi4O4S3. The solid
line is a ﬁt to the data using an expression for charged boson.
The dotted line is an empirical interpolation, which better
reproduces the temperature region close to Tc.
The ac resistivity of Bi4O4S3 was measured as a func-
tion of temperature using a standard four-probe method
in a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS).
Figure 1 (a) shows the temperature dependence of the
resistivity ρ(T ).
A metallic like behavior is observed
between 5 K to 220 K with a relatively high residual
resistivity value of 2 mΩ.cm. The transition to the su-
perconducting state is relatively sharp with a Tc (onset)
of 4.8(1) K and Tc (zero) of 4.6(1) K. The inset shows
the temperature variation of the resistivity in a set of
magnetic ﬁelds from 0 to 40 kOe. ρ(T ) exhibits posi-
tive magnetoresistance (MR) in the normal state (just
above Tc). At 6 K, the value of MR increases by 10.6 %
for an applied magnetic ﬁeld of 40 kOe. The tempera-
ture dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 shown in
Fig. 1 (b), was determined from the resistive transitions,
deﬁned by a 90 % drop of the normal state resistivity val-
ues, determined just above Tc. The Hc2(T ) curve shows
a positive curvature close to Tc and is linear thereafter. A
similar behavior has also been observed in polycrystalline
borocarbides [18], MgB2 [19, 20], Nb0.18Re0.82 [21], and
Re3W [22] and is considered as a signature of multi-gap
superconductivity. A conventional Werthamer-Helfand-
Hohenberg model can not describe Hc2(T ) of Bi4O4S3.
However, to estimate Hc2 at absolute zero, a ﬁt to the
Hc2(T ) data was made using the Hc2(T ) expression for
charged bosons [23],
Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)
(

The ﬁt yields Hc2(0) = 15.3(4) kOe, which implies a
Ginzburg coherence length ξ ≈12 nm. To get a better
estimation of Hc2(T ) close to Tc, an empirical interpola-
tion (shown as a dotted line in Fig. 1 (b)) was later used
in Eq. 4 for calculating the temperature dependence of
the penetration depth of Bi4O4S3.
ZF-µSR measurements were performed to look for any
unusual temperature-dependent relaxation processes,
which may be associated with the onset of supercon-
ductivity. Figure 2 shows the ZF-µSR time spectra of
Bi4O4S3, collected below (at 2 K) and above (at 6 K)
Tc. Practically, no diﬀerence between the two data sets
is observable.
The ZF data can be described using a
Kubo-Toyabe relaxation function [24] multiplied by an
exponential decay function,

equal values of Λ are consistent with the presence of di-
luted and randomly oriented electronic moments proba-
bly arising from impurities. The ZF-µSR data completely
rule out the presence of any magnetic anomaly in the su-
perconducting state of Bi4O4S3 as for instance the ap-
pearance of spontaneous magnetic ﬁelds associated with
a time-reversal-symmetry breaking pairing state.
Figure 3 shows the TF-µSR time spectra collected at
19 mK and 5 K in a transverse ﬁeld of 300 Oe. At 5 K, the
sample is in the normal state and the local ﬁeld probed by
the muons is the applied ﬁeld slightly broadened by the
nuclear moments contribution, which is responsible for
the weak relaxation of the precession signal. By contrast,
the data collected at 19 mK shows a more pronounced
damping due to the inhomogeneous ﬁeld distribution gen-
erated by the formation of a vortex lattice in Bi4O4S3.
The TF-µSR time spectra were analyzed using Gaussian
damped spin precession signal along with an exponential
relaxation to take into account the corresponding com-
ponent observed in the ZF spectra.

For a superconductor with hexagonal vortex lattice, σsc
is related to the penetration depth, λ by the Brandt equa-
tion [26], which is based on a Ginzburg-Landau treatment
of the vortex state,

the superﬂuid density. Figure 5 shows the temperature

rizes the corresponding ﬁtted parameters.
The two s-
wave gap model gives a lower χ2
reduced value than a single
gap model thus suggesting that Bi4O4S3 is a multiple gap
superconductor and making a connection between BiS2-
based layered superconductors and the layered Fe-based
superconductors [31–34]. Other prominent examples of
superconductivity are represented by MgB2, NbSe2, and
Lu2Fe3Si5 [35–38]. However, a single s-wave gap can not
be ruled out completely as claimed in ref. 14.
From our data, we obtain λ(0) = 861(17) nm. Remark-
able is that the value of lambda at T = 0 K is one of the

highest among all known bulk superconductors. This re-
ﬂects a very low superﬂuid carrier density ns of ≈3×1021
cm−3. It should be noted that the value of λ(0) is inde-
pendent on details of analysis such as the correction for
the ﬁeld dependence of σ and it is not strongly depen-
dent on the assumption of a vortex lattice of hexagonal
symmetry. The assumption of a regular vortex structure
is generally valid in the FC case if parameters such as the
external ﬁeld are chosen in a reasonable range and if the
system is not extremely anisotropic. Having hexagonal
or rectangular symmetry makes almost no diﬀerence in
the value of the penetration depth and its temperature
dependence. For instance, for a square arrangement the
pre-factor of Eq. 4 would change only by 2 %. The eﬀect
of vortex disorder is more diﬃcult to quantify exactly.
Disorder would give an additional contribution to σ so
that the estimated value for ns is actually an upper limit.
Since the contribution of disorder adds quadratically to
that of the intrinsic inhomogeneity of the vortex state we
do not expect a big change of the value of λ. Even in
systems, such as R(Fe1−xCox)2As2 where disorder may
be important, measurements on the same system in the
vortex state by TF-µSR [39] (sensitive to disorder) and
in the Meissner state by low energy µSR [40] (insensi-

In summary, resistivity and µSR measurements have
been performed on superconducting Bi4O4S3. Temper-
ature dependence of the upper critical ﬁelds and also
the absolute value, Hc2(0) = 15.3(4) kOe were deter-
mined from the resistivity measurements. The Hc2(T )
data shows a positive curvature close to Tc, which is
a sign of multi-gap superconductivity in Bi4O4S3. ZF-
µSR data show no sign of magnetic anomaly in the
superconducting ground state of Bi4O4S3.
The tem-
perature dependence of λ−2 is compatible with a two-
gap s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values,
∆1(0) = 0.93(3), ∆2(0) = 0.09(4) meV and penetra-
tion depth, λ(0) = 861(17) nm.
The presence of two
superconducting gaps in Bi4O4S3 is predicted by theo-
retical works such as ﬁrst principles band structure cal-
culations suggesting two band crossing the Fermi surface
and the RPA analysis of a two-orbital model for the BiS2-
based superconductors [10, 11]. Hall, Seebeck coeﬃcients
and magnetoresistance measurements also further sup-
port our experimental ﬁnding [13, 15]. It is worth men-
tioning that even though our data are more compatible
with a two-gap model, a single-gap model can not be
ruled out completely. Our results show that Bi4O4S3 is a
bulk superconductor with a fully developed node-less su-
perconducting energy gap and extremely low superﬂuid
density compared to other layered superconductors.
