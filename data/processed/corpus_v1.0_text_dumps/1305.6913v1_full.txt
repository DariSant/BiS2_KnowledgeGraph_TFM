Abstract 
We report on the superconducting gap and pairing symmetry in layered superconductor 
Bi4O4S3. The measurement of temperature dependence of magnetic penetration depth was 
carried out using tunnel diode oscillator technique.  It is observed that Bi4O4S3 is a 
conventional s-wave type superconductor with fully developed gap. The zero-temperature 
value of the superconducting energy gap Δ0 was found to be 1.54 meV, corresponding to the 
ratio 2Δ0/kBTc=7.2 which is much higher than the BCS value of 3.53.  In the superconducting 
range, superfluid density is very well described by single gap s- wave model.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Introduction 
 
Superconductivity involves macroscopic quantum condensation of paired electrons. 
Such pairing could originate from a variety of quantum interactions.  Thus, when a new 
superconducting system is discovered, the first challenge is attained towards deciphering the 
interaction leading to the pairing mechanism.  In this context, the recent discovery of 
superconductivity in layered sulphide Bi4O4S3 by Mizuguchi et al. [1] has once again 
reignited the field of superconductivity. Its transition temperature (Tc0) is ~4.5K [1,2].  With 
high pressure synthesis, a substantial increase in Tc ~10.6 K has been observed for LaOBiS2 
[3]. A series of ReOBiS2 compounds have been reported with constituent BiS2 conducting 
layers [4,5]. Theoretical works based on the first principle band structure calculations [1,6] 
predict that the dominating bands for the electron conduction as well as for the 
superconductivity are derived from the Bi 6px and 6py orbitals where the electrons typically 
exhibit weak correlation effects.  Interestingly, the structure of these sulfides comprising of 
BiS2 layers is similar to the layered cuprates and pnictide superconductors. In Bi4O4S3, it is 
the BiS2 layer where superconductivity is achieved by carrier doping either by substitution [3] 
or by creating deficiency [2].   
There have been a variety of reports on the origin of superconducting mechanism in 
BiS2 based compounds. While nesting of the Fermi surface and large electron phonon 
coupling constant are predicted for LaO1−xFxBiS2 [7,8], there are some indication that even 
for Bi4O4S3, the coupling strength could exceed the conventional BCS prediction [9]. There 
are theories that predict structural instabilities [7,8]  in close proximity to competing 
ferroelectric and charge density wave (CDW) phases [8]. This instability is possibly due to 
anharmonic potential of the S ions lying on the same plane as the Bi ions. In parallel to the 
spin-density wave (SDW) instability in Fe-based superconductors, a CDW instability from 


negative phonon modes at or around the M point, (π, π), is suggested to be essential to the 
superconductivity in LaO1−xFxBiS2 [8]. Thus, theoretically, spin fluctuation may also account 
for the superconducting pairing in these compounds.  
Towards this end, the magnetic penetration depth is very important for the 
determination of the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter and pairing 
symmetry.  In conventional BCS theory, this pairing is attained between two electrons with 
opposite momenta through exchange of phonons. In the weak electron – phonon coupling 
scenario, a constant ratio of superconducting gap and superconducting transition temperature

which is the activation energy for 
quasi-particle excitations of the superconducting ground state and equivalently termed as the 
superconducting gap. It is an extremely useful probe for distinguishing between different 
possible superconducting gap structures on the Fermi surface and to reflect on the 
superconducting pairing mechanism.  Several examples are pertinent. Temperature variation 
in the superfluid density consistent with weak-coupled d wave superconductor has been 
observed in hole doped cuprates such as YBa2CuO7−δ [10], Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+δ [11].  Quadratic 
power law dependence of superfluid density on temperature consistent with a d-wave pairing 
state exhibiting unitary limit impurity scattering was confirmed in Pr2−xCexCuO4−y (PCCO) 
[12]. d-wave pairing with

 was observed in organic superconductors κ-
(ET)2Cu[N(CN)2]Br [13] and such dependence was also seen in heavy fermion compound 
CeCoIn5 [14]. Similarly various experiments have provided quantitative evidence for the two-
gap nature of superconductivity in MgB2 [15]. It was found that the smaller gap is on the π 
sheet with Δs=2.5meV ≈ 0.42ΔBCS and larger gap is on σ sheets with Δl=6.45meV ≈ 1.1ΔBCS 
(ΔBCS represents weak coupling BCS value) [15].  In CaAlSi, an anisotrpic 3D s-wave 


superconductivity was observed [16]. Further, superconducting state in oxypnictides has been 
found to be consistent with the fully gapped s± pairing symmetry[17]. Some other techniques 
such as Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) [18], Scanning Tunnelling 
Spectroscopy(STS)[19], Muon Spin Rotation and Mutual Coil Induction [20] have also been 
used to ascertain pairing symmetry, but these techniques are extremely sensitive to the 
surface state.  The tunnel diode oscillator technique that we have used, is also surface 
sensitive but it is less susceptible to impurities since the length scale probed is much larger 
(for type – II superconductors) than the coherence length as probed in a STS.  Also because 
of limited directional resolution it is difficult to use the other techniques in three dimensional 
anisotropic Fermi surfaces. The magnetic penetration depth on the other hand is a bulk probe 
where a high degree of resolution can be achieved. 
In this paper, we report a detailed penetration depth study on polycrystalline samples 
of recently discovered superconductor Bi4O4S3. We have successfully synthesized this new 
superconductor with enhanced superconducting transition temperature (Tconset ~ 5.3K). The 
low temperature data of penetration depth measurement were fitted to the BCS equation that 
yielded a gap ratio

which is larger than BCS value of 3.53. Moreover, the 
gap obtained from the fitting of superfluid density in full temperature range (upto Tc) is 7.2 
which is almost twice of the weak coupling BCS value suggesting surprisingly strong 
coupling in Bi4O4S3 superconductor. 
 
Experimental 
Polycrystalline sample of Bi4O4S3 was prepared using a conventional solid state 
reaction method. Bi2S3, Bi2O3 powders and S grains were ground, pelletized, sealed into an 
evacuated quartz tube and heated at 510 ºC for 12 h. The product was well-ground, pelletized 
and again annealed at 510 ºC for 10 h. Transport and magnetic measurements were 


undertaken in a Cryogenic low temperature and high magnetic field Cryogen Free system in 
conjunction with variable temperature insert. 
The London penetration measurement was carried out using tunnel diode resonator 
technique which consisted of a copper coil connected parallel to a capacitor and driven to 
resonance due to a tunnel diode oscillator at radio frequency (2.3MHz at room temperature).  
The sample was placed inside in this copper solenoid coil which formed the part of the 
inductor. The amplitude of the rf field generated by coil is ~1 µT which is much less than the 
lower critical field Hc1 of BiS2 based superconductors [2]. Hence the sample was in Meissner 
state in zero applied external dc field. The most important feature of this measurement is the 
stability of the oscillator. With a proper choice of circuit elements and by taking care of 
shielding, we were able to obtain a stability of one part in 107 Hz. An oven stabilized 
frequency counter was used for measurements of frequency.  The sample temperature was 
measured and regulated with a 340 Lakeshore temperature controller. The sample was kept 
inside the inductor such that the plane of the platelet was perpendicular to the axis of the 
inductor that formed a part of LC component of the ultra-stable oscillator. A change in the 
magnetic state of the sample results in a change in the inductance of the coil which is 
reflected as a shift in oscillator frequency that was measured using an Agilent 53131A 
counter.  Moreover, the shift in the resonant frequency (

Results and Discussion 
 
The Rietveld refined room-temperature XRD patterns for Bi4O4S3 sample is reported 
elsewhere [22] that confirms the I4/mmm phase purity of the specimen. Figure 1 shows the 
resistivity behaviour near transition temperature for Bi4O4S3 and the inset shows dependence 
of resistivity from 300 K to 2 K for the same. The resistivity varies in a T2 dependence as 
appropriate for a Fermi liquid state within a narrow window of 25 K to 50 K. The resistivity 
behaviour for the undoped sample Bi6O8S5 on the other hand, exhibits semiconducting 


behaviour down to the lowest measured temperature [22]. Superconductivity is optimized for 
50% deficiency in SO4 concentration that is the equivalent Bi4O4S3 phase.  
The inset of Figure 2 shows the change of the penetration depth

than onset of resistive transition.  The main panel of Figure 2 plots the variation in 
penetration depth as a function of reduced temperature. In the following, we discuss the  low

at low temperature. Here λ(0) and Δ0 are the values of penetration depth  and the 
superconducting energy gap Δ at T=0. This exponential dependence is fairly applicable to the 
for T/Tc ≤ 0.5 [24]. In case of a nodeless anisotropic energy gap or distinct gaps on different

Qualitatively, the observed weak temperature dependence below 2.5 K in Figure 2 is 
consistent with s-wave BCS theory.  This also marks the signature of a fully developed 
superconducting gap. Fitting the low temperature data with power law Tn yields a very high 
value of n ~ 7 which rules out the possibility of d wave pairing. At low temperature

±0.3 and the corresponding value of energy gap Δ0~1.43 meV. This gap ratio is very high 
compared to the weak coupling limit of 3.53. This suggests that Bi4O4S3 is a strongly coupled 
superconductor. Such possible strong coupling in this material has been made in a detailed 
theoretical analysis by Yildirim [26].  Evidence for strong coupling is also seen in STS 
measurement [9], although the value of gap ratio reported is much higher; 2Δ0/kBTc ≈ 17.  To 
bring in a prospective, the observed gap value from our experiments can be compared with 
some of the other strong coupling superconductors such as 4.8 in KOs2O6 [27,24], 5.2 in 
PrOs4Sb12 [28], 4.4 in SrPd2Ge2 [29], 3.87 in RbOs2O6 [27], ~5 in SrPt3P [30], ~ 8 in 
PuCoGa5 [31] and 7.74 in YBa2Cu3O6.98 [32].  
A  s-wave pairing with sign reversal is suggested if spin fluctuations play main role in 
cooper pairing [6]. With regard to Bi4O4S3, Y.Gio has formulated a theory base on two orbital 
model for the pairing symmetry on the basis of three possibilities, the isotropic s-wave, the 
anisotropic s-wave and the d-wave pairing [33]. To analyze our data in the light of these 
possibilities, in Figure 3 we plot the normalized superfluid density,

a function of reduced temperature over full temperature range.  Best fits to the superfluid 
density over the entire temperature range allows one to detect the existence of multiple gaps

 or the anisotropies of the superconducting 
gap(s).  But this method requires 

Here Δ0 is the gap magnitude at zero temperature and ‘a’ is a free parameter that 
depends on the particular pairing state and    is Boltzmann constant.  The integration is over 
the entire quasi-particle energies measured from the chemical potential [23]. As shown in 
Figure 3, for the estimated value of

= 734nm a comparison is attempted for the two 
fluid model [35], and the clean and dirty s-wave models [36]. Evidently, the superfluid 
density for Bi4O4S3 does not fit at all to the two weak coupling BCS s–wave curves 
corresponding to dirty and clean limits and neither do the data follow the two fluid Gorter and 
Casimir model. Subsequently, the 


 data were fitted using eq. (7) and gap function (8) 
taking ‘Δ0’ and ‘a’ as free parameter using Mathematica. As is evident, the superfluid density 
data show excellent fitting for a single s-wave equation for 2∆0 /kBTc= 7.18 ± 0.17 with the 
corresponding energy gap value Δ0 ~ 1.54 meV and a = 1.23 ± 0.007 . This value of gap ratio

 is almost double of weak coupling BCS value of 3.53 which again underlines 
the strong electron – phonon coupling in Bi4O4S3. It should be noted that the gap values 
estimated from raw fitting of BCS equation would be less accurate than the gap estimated 
from the full temperature range super fluid density since the BCS equation is applicable at 
asymptotically approached lowest temperature.  The value of ‘a’ however is higher than its 
value for isotropic s-wave gap (a ~ 1) for weak coupling. The value of ‘a’ relates to the 
specific heat transition [23].  Since we don’t have specific heat data, no conclusive comment 
can be made on the obtained best fit value of ‘a’.  An attempt to ascertain two gap fitting 
using alfa model for two gap superconductivity [15], was also undertaken.  The technique 
involved letting the values of constants get determined self consistently, and the results 
indicated convergence to a single gap that convincingly exclude the possibility of two gaps in 
the present case.   
  
Conclusion 
 
In conclusion, a study of temperature dependent magnetic penetration depth and super 
fluid density in the newly discovered layered sulphide Bi4O4S3 superconductor confirms a 
fully gapped s-wave pairing in the strong coupling limit.  The low temperature 

tends to be rather fIat below 0.5Tc and marks 
the signature of fully developed superconducting gap. Superfluid density is very best fitted 
with single gap s-wave equation with gap ratio 2Δ0=7.2kBTc that indicates the existence of 
strong electron phonon coupling in this primary BiS2 based layered superconductor.
