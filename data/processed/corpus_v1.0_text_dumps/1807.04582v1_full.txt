Abstract: 
We report the superconductivity in layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound. 
The La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound has been reported recently by our group, which has a tetragonal 
structure with the space group P4/nmm. The crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 can be regarded as 
alternate stacks of LaOBiS2-type layer and rock-salt-type (Bi,Ag)S layer. We measured low-
temperature electrical resistivity and observed superconductivity at 0.5 K. The observation of 
superconductivity in the La2O2Bi3AgS6 should provide us with the successful strategy for 
developing new superconducting phases by the insertion of a rock-salt-type chalcogenide layer 
into the van der Waals gap of BiS2-based layered compound like LaOBiS2.

The discovery of BiS2-based superconductors made a huge interest in the scientific 
community [1,2]. In this progress several new materials possessing the bismuth chalcogenides 
[BiCh2 (Ch=S, Se)] layers have been designed [1-10]. Firstly, the superconductivity has been 
reported in Bi4O4S3 layered compound with a transition temperature (Tc) of 4.5 K [1,3]. Later, 
other BiS2-based superconductors REO1−xFxBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Nd, Yb, Pr) and Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 
were discovered after Bi4O4S3 [1–11]. So far, the superconductivity in the BiS2 based compounds 
has been reported to be induced via charge carrier doping into BiS2 layers for the REO1−xFxBiS2 
and Sr1−xRExFBiS2 compounds [3-11]. These superconductors are very sensitive to the external 
hydrostatic pressure and the highest Tc above 10 K was achieved for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
Sr1−xRExFBiS2 (RE = La, Ce,Nd, Pr, Sm) compounds [12-16].  
Recently, new layered oxysulfide LaOPbBiS3 has been reported by Y.-L Sun et. al [17]. 
They proposed that LaOPbBiS3 compound is a narrow gap semiconductor with an activation 
energy of ∼17 meV, which suggested that LaOPbBiS3 and its derivatives may be promising for 
thermoelectric applications [17]. After careful structural analysis for the LaOBiPbS3 phase [18], 
we have proposed a material design strategy focusing on the van der Waals gaps between the two 
BiCh2 layers. The van der Waals gaps of LaOBiS2 can be filled by inserting some rock salt layers 
composed of M2S2 [M = Pb, Bi] [18], which results in the formation of La2O2M4S6-type 
compounds.  Later on, Y. Hijikata et al. reported the synthesis of La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound [19]. 
The structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 is similar to LaOBiPbS3, but the interlayer bond (M2–S1 bond) in 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 is shorter than that of LaOBiPbS3. The electrical conductivity and carrier 
concentration of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are higher than those of LaOBiPbS3 and LaOBiS2, possibly due to 
the shorter interlayer bonds and/or chemical pressure effect with compressed a-axis [19]. Our 
previous electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements showed no signature of a 
superconducting transition down to 2 K [19].  
Here, we measured the electrical resistivity of La2O2Bi3AgS6 down to 0.1 K using an 
adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) system. We observed superconductivity in 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound at Tczero = 0.5 K. This is the first observation of superconductivity among 
La2O2M4S6-type compounds. 
The polycrystalline sample of La2O2Bi3AgS6 was prepared by a solid-state reaction method. 
Powders of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), and AgO (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%) and S

(99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3AgS6 were mixed in a pestle and mortar, 
pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 720 °C for 15 h. The obtained sample 
was reground for homogeneity, pelletized, and heated at 720 °C for 15 h. The phase purity of the 
prepared sample and the optimal annealing conditions were examined using laboratory X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Kα radiation. The crystal structure parameters were refined using the 
Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [20]. Schematic image of the crystal structure were drawn 
using VESTA (see the inset of Fig. 1) [21]. The electrical resistivity down to T = 0.1 K was 
measured by four probe technique using adiabatic demagnetization refrigerator (ADR) system on 
the Physical Property measurement system (PPMS: Quantum Design).  
Figure 1 shows the room temperature XRD pattern of La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound. The 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound crystallized in the tetragonal structure with the space group of P4/nmm, 
which is composed of stacked [M4S6] layers and fluorite-type [La2O2] layers. No impurity peak 
has been observed, and all the observed peaks are well indexed to the main phase of La2O2Bi3AgS6 
compound, which is comparable to the previous study [19]. The estimated lattice parameters are a 
= 4.0568(1) Å and c = 19.348(1) Å. The crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound is shown in 
the inset of Fig. 1, in which chalcogenide layers of (BiAg)S and LaO(BiAg)S2 are alternately 
stacking. 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] from 300 to 0.1 
K. The overall behavior of the normal state electrical resistivity is metallic.  The lower resistivity 
in comparison with previous report might be due to the smaller lattice parameters for this sample. 
The smaller lattice parameter c can make the shorter interlayer M1-S3 bonding. Due to the smaller 
lattice parameter a the in-plane M1-S1 bonding becomes shorter, which is preferable for metallic 
conductivity [22]. We have analyzed the composition of the sample using energy dispersive x-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX) and found slightly high concentration of Ag in the present sample in 
comparison with the previous sample [19]. The smaller lattice parameters might be due to the 
excess Ag concentration in the present sample.  
Notably, we observed a broad hump in the ρ(T) curve below T*∼180 K, which is quite 
similar to the hump observed in the ρ(T) curve below ∼280 K for the EuFBiS2 compound, which 
shows superconductivity at 0.3 K [23]. The origin of the hump in the ρ(T ) curve was proposed as 
the charge density wave (CDW) transition in EuFBiS2. From the analogy, we assume that the 
anomaly is caused by a CDW transition.

The resistivity starts to deviate from the normal state value below the temperature 2.5 K 
and becomes zero at 0.5 K [see the inset of Fig. 2], which suggests the emergence of 
superconductivity in the La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound. As mentioned above, the anomaly at T* may 
be related to a CDW transition. Therefore, it is expected that some part of the Fermi surface 
disappears in the CDW state and the superconductivity develops on the remaining part. With the 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 and related La2O2M4S6 systems, we may be able to discuss the universal 
relationship between superconductivity and CDW in the BiCh2-based compounds. 
Furthermore, there is another notable characteristics in the La2O2M4S6 system. According 
to the band calculations for LaOBiPbS3 [18], the valence bands just below the Fermi energy (EF) 
are mainly composed of S-3p orbitals of the S3 site (see the inset of Fig. 1) in the M2S2 layer. This 
is different from the case of the typical BiS2-based compounds in which the valence bands just 
below EF are composed of S-3p orbitals of the in-plane S1 site. The similar situation is expected 
for La2O2Bi3AgS6 compound: the valence bands near EF would be composed of S-3p bands of the 
rock-salt type (Bi,Ag)S layer. Therefore, the superconductivity states in La2O2Bi3AgS6 may be 
different from those of the typical BiS2-based superconductors because of the difference in the 
electronic states near EF. We expect that the discovery of the superconductivity in La2O2Bi3AgS6 
will extend the field of layered bismuth chalcogenide superconductors.   
  
In conclusion, we reported the observation of superconductivity (Tczero = 0.5 K) in the 
polycrystalline sample of layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6.  In the temperature dependence 
of resistivity, an anomaly possibly related to the CDW transition (T *∼180 K) is observed. The 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 and related La2O2M4S6 systems will be useful to discuss the universal relationship 
between superconductivity and CDW states and to develop new CDW-related superconductors.
