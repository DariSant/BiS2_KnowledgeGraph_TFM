Abstract 
Investigation of isotope effects on superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is one of the useful 
methods to examine whether electron–phonon interaction is essential for pairing mechanisms. 
The layered BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductor family is a candidate for unconventional 
superconductors, because unconventional isotope effects have previously been observed in 
La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3. In this study, we investigated the isotope effects of 32S and 34S in the 
high-pressure phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2, which has a monoclinic crystal structure and a higher Tc of 
~10 K under high pressures, and observed conventional-type isotope shifts in Tc. The 
conventional-type isotope effects in the monoclinic phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2 are different from the 
unconventional isotope effects observed in La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, which have a tetragonal 
structure. The obtained results suggest that the pairing mechanisms of BiCh2-based 
superconductors could be switched by a structural-symmetry change in the superconducting 
layers induced by pressure effects.

Introduction 
 
In conventional superconductors, electron–phonon interactions are essential for the 
formation of Cooper pairs1. According to BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory1, the transition 
temperature (Tc) of a phonon-mediated superconductor is proportional to its phonon energy ħ, 
where ħ and  are the Planck constant and the phonon frequency, respectively. Therefore, Tc of 
conventional superconductors is sensitive to the phonon frequency, and modifications of the 
isotope mass (M) of the constituent elements, the so-called isotope effect, have been used to 
investigate the importance of electron–phonon interactions in the pairing of various 
superconductors. The isotope exponent  is defined by Tc ~ M-, and  ~ 0.5 is expected according 
to BCS theory1. For instance,  values close to 0.5 have been detected in (Ba,K)BiO3 (O ~ 0.5)2, 
MgB2 (B ~ 0.3)3, and borocarbides (B ~ 0.3)4. In addition, the hydrides (H3S and LaH10) high-
Tc superconductors also showed a conventional shift in Tc with H = 0.3–0.5 in isotope effect 
investigations5,6. In contrast, in superconductors with unconventional mechanisms, the isotope 
effect is not consistent with the BCS theory, and  values deviated from 0.57,8.  
The target system of this study, layered BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductors, has 
been extensively studied since its discovery in 20129-11. Because of its layered structure composed 
of alternate stacking of a superconducting layer and a blocking (insulating) layer, which resembles 
those of high-Tc superconductors12,13, many studies have been performed on material development 
and on pairing mechanisms11. Although non-doped (parent) BiCh2-based compounds are 
semiconductors with a band gap, electron doping of the BiCh2 layers makes the system metallic, 
and superconductivity is induced. An example of this is F substitution in REOBiCh2 (RE: rare 
earth)9-11. In addition, the superconducting properties of BiCh2-based systems are very sensitive 
to the effects of external (physical) and/or chemical pressures14-17. When external pressures are 
applied, the crystal structures of REOBiCh2-based systems tend to distort into a monoclinic 
(P21/m) structure, and a higher-Tc phase (Tc > 10 K) is induced16. Instead, by applying in-plane 
chemical pressure (shrinkage of the Bi-Ch conducting plane) via isovalent-element substitutions 
at the RE and/or Ch sites, a tetragonal (P4/nmm) phase is maintained, and bulk superconductivity 
is induced in the tetragonal phase. The emergence of bulk superconductivity due to chemical 
pressure effects can be explained by the suppression of local structural disorder, which is caused 
by the presence of Bi lone pair electrons18-20. 
Regarding the mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based family, the pairing 
mechanisms of the BiCh2-based superconductor family are still controversial19, owing to 
superconducting properties that are tunable by external and/or chemical pressure effects, which 
sometimes causes scattered results. Although earlier theoretical and experimental studies 
suggested conventional mechanisms with fully gapped s-wave pairing states21-23, recent 
theoretical calculations of Tc indicated that a Tc of an order of several K to 10 K in BiS2-based 


3 
 
superconductors with a tetragonal structure cannot be explained within phonon-mediated 
models24. Furthermore, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) proposed 
unconventional pairing mechanisms owing to the observation of a highly anisotropic 
superconducting gap in NdO0.71F0.29BiS225. In addition, a study on the Se isotope effect with 76Se 
and 80Se in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe (Fig. 1f) indicated the possibility of unconventional (non-phonon) 
mechanisms with Se close to 0 (-0.04 < Se < 0.04)26. In addition, we have recently reported on 
an unconventional isotope effect with 32S and 34S in Bi4O4S3 (-0.1 < S < 0.1) (Fig. 1g)27. These 
two superconductors have a tetragonal crystal structure and show a relatively low Tc of 3.8 K for 
LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe and 4.7 K for Bi4O4S3. As mentioned above, the BiS2-based superconductor has 
a high-pressure (high-P) phase, which exhibits a higher Tc of over 10 K16. Therefore, this 
background encouraged us to plan an isotope effect study for a high-P (monoclinic) phase with a 
higher Tc, in order to find a way to design new BiCh2-based superconductors with a higher Tc and 
to elucidate the mechanisms of superconductivity in the system. 
Herein, we show experimental evidence of phonon-mediated superconductivity in a 
high-P phase of BiS2-based superconductors (Sr,La)FBiS2. We have investigated the sulphur 
isotope effects (32S and 34S) on Tc for a high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2 with Tc ~10 K28-30. 
Conventional shifts in Tc between samples synthesised with 32S and 34S were observed, which 
suggests the importance of phonons for the pairing mechanisms in the compound. The 
conventional isotope effects in (Sr,La)FBiS, which has a monoclinic structure, are in contrast to 
the unconventional isotope effects observed in La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, which have a 
tetragonal structure26,27. Based on a combination of the discussion of previous and present isotope 
studies, we suggest that the structural difference between the tetragonal and monoclinic structures 
could be a switch of the pairing mechanisms in BiCh2-based superconductors.  
 
 
Results 
Characterisation of isotope samples 
In general, the shift in Tc due to isotope effects is very small, even with  ~ 0.5 for low-
Tc superconductors. Therefore, examining the isotope effects with sets of samples with 
comparable superconducting properties is important to reach a reliable conclusion. However, 
precise control of the superconducting characteristics of BiCh2-based compounds is the challenge 
of this study, because the Tc of BiCh2-based superconductors depends on the carrier concentration. 
From among the BiCh2-based compounds, we selected the Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 system, because the 
carrier concentration in this system is essentially determined by the La concentration (x), and x 
can easily be analysed by compositional analysis, such as energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy 
(EDX). Here, we synthesised polycrystalline samples of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 using 32S and 34S isotope 


4 
 
chemicals for the investigation of sulphur isotope effects. We confirmed that the structural 
characteristics (particularly lattice constants) of the examined samples are comparable on the 
basis of powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses (Figs. 1a and 1b). Detailed Rietveld analysis 
results are summarised in the Supplementary file. Although small impurity peaks of Bi and LaF3 
were observed, the lattice constants for the examined samples were comparable as shown in Fig. 
1b. The La concentration (x) analysed by EDX was x = 0.36~0.38, which is plotted in Fig. 1c. 
Among these samples, the carrier concentrations of samples #32-2, #34-1, and #34-2 were 
comparable, and that of #32-1 was slightly higher, where the sample labels indicate isotope mass 
(32 or 34) and batch number (1 or 2). 
 
Magnetisation measurements under high pressure 
 
As reported in a recent pressure study30, (Sr,La)FBiS2 shows a dramatic increase in Tc 
from ~3 K for the low-pressure (low-P) phase to ~10 K for the high-P phase on application of 
external pressure of about 1 GPa. The crystal structure of the high-P phase can be regarded as 
monoclinic, whereas that for the low-P phase is tetragonal, as shown in Figs. 1d and 1e, which is 
similar to the structural evolution of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under pressures16,30. Figures 2a-2d show the 
temperature dependences of magnetisation measured at 10 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC). All 
samples of #32-1, #32-2, #34-1, and #34-2 show the transition from a low-P phase to a high-P 
phase, as plotted in Fig. 2e. Notably, in the high-P phase after the Tc jump, Tc does not change by 
an increase in applied pressure below 1.4 GPa. A similar behaviour was reported for EuFBiS2; the 
pressure dependence of Tc of EuFBiS2 showed a plateau under pressures above the critical 
pressure31. The appearance of the Tc plateau would be related to the structural characteristics of 
BiS2-based superconductors composed of fluoride-type blocking layers. This trend enabled us to 
examine the S isotope effect for the high-P phase of the samples. Figure 3a shows selected data 
of the temperature dependence of magnetisation for high-P phases of #32-1, #32-2, #34-1, and 
#34-2. Zoomed plots near the onset temperature of the superconducting transition (Tc) are shown 
in Fig. 3b. To estimate Tc, the temperature differential of magnetisation (dM/dT) was calculated 
and plotted as a function of temperature (Figs. 3c-3f). Tc was estimated to be the temperature at 
which linear fitting lines for just below the transition temperature within a range of 0.5 K, as 
indicated by the red lines in those figures. The estimated Tc are 10.42, 10.16, 9.94, and 9.73 K for 
the high-P phases of #32-1, #32-2, #34-1, and #34-2, respectively (see Table I for the error). The 
highest Tc was observed for #32-1 with a higher La concentration (electron doping amount). For 
the two samples with 34S, x for #34-1 is slightly higher than x for #34-2, while the difference is 
within the error bars shown in Fig. 1c. The difference in Tc, however, can be seen in Figs. 3e and 
3f. The trend that a higher Tc is observed for a sample with higher x is consistent with the trend 
seen for #32-1 and #32-2. Although the Tc is sensitive to the La concentration, we can reach a 


5 
 
conclusion by comparing the Tc based on the analysed La concentrations. When comparing the Tc 
between #32-2 and #34-1, a different trend was observed; the Tc estimated for #32-2 was higher 
than that of #34-1 with x slightly higher than x for #32-2. This fact implies that the isotope effect 
in the high-P phase of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 is conventionally present.  
As La concentrations for #32-2 and #34-2 are very close, estimation of their S may be 
essential, which gives S ~ 0.7. This value is slightly larger than the conventional  = 0.5 expected 
from BCS theory, but it suggests the importance of phonon-mediated pairing in the high-P phase 
of (Sr,La)FBiS2. There are uncertainties in the determination of the essential S for the high-P 
phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2 because Tc depends on the carrier concentration in this system, and the 
expected difference in Tc between samples with 32S and 34S is not large. However, with the results 
shown here and the systematic analyses of S, we can reach the conclusion that phonons are 
essential for the superconductivity pairing mechanisms in the high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2. This 
is in contrast to the unconventional isotope effects observed in La(O,F)BiSSe26 and Bi4O4S327. We 
discuss the possible differences in the structural and electronic characteristics of (Sr,La)FBiS2 (S 
~0.7) and La(O,F)BiSSe (-0.04 < Se < 0.04)26 in the following section. 
 
 
Discussion 
As summarised in Fig. 1, isotope effect suggesting the importance of phonon was 
observed for the high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2, whereas unconventional isotope effects were 
observed in La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S326,27. Although there are some possible factors, which 
could affect isotope effect, other than pairing states32, we consider that the observed difference in 
isotope effect is essentially caused by the different pairing states between those systems. The 
reason for proposing the scenario is the recent observation of nematic superconductivity in 
La(O,F)BiSSe33,34; nematic superconductivity has been observed in unconventional 
superconductors like Fe-based and Bi2Se3-based superconductors35,36. Since nematic 
superconductivity emerges in both LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe (tetragonal) and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (tetragonal) 
with different carrier concentrations but with comparable structures of the BiSSe conducting layer, 
unconventional pairing states would commonly present in tetragonal BiCh2-based 
superconductors with a tetragonal symmetry without structural distortion or local disorder. In 
contrast, nematic superconductivity was not observed in Nd(O,F)BiS237, which is also tetragonal 
but has larger local structural disorder than La(O,F)BiSSe11,17,19. These facts suggest the 
importance of structural symmetry in the conducting layers and would support our scenario 
suggested in this article. Here, we discuss the possible differences in electronic states and pairing 
states between tetragonal and monoclinic phases.

The high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2 has a monoclinic structure and a distorted in-plane 
structure in the BiS2 layers30. In contrast, La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3 have tetragonal structures, 
in which the square Bi-Ch network forms a superconducting plane. Although the low-P phase of 
(Sr,La)FBiS2 is tetragonal, same as for La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, bulk superconductivity is not 
observed at ambient pressure because of insufficient in-plane chemical pressure17-19,30. In the low 
pressure range, bulk superconductivity is induced, but the determination of Tc is difficult because 
there are two possible superconducting transitions of the manometer (Pb) and the high-P phase. 
Based on the isotope effects in the high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2, La(O,F)BiSSe, and Bi4O4S3, we 
suggest that structural symmetry breaking in the superconducting BiCh2 layer is an essential factor 
in the switching of the isotope effect from unconventional to conventional. 
 
We calculated the band structures of (Sr,La)FBiS2 and La(O,F)BiSSe (see 
Supplementary file). Note that the calculated results for (Sr,La)FBiS2 are based on the tetragonal 
structure of the low-P phase, because structural parameters for the high-P phase have not been 
experimentally obtained for (Sr,La)FBiS2, and the structural relaxation was not successful for the 
high-P phase in this work. One can determine that the shape of the Fermi surface is similar 
between (Sr,La)FBiS2 and La(O,F)BiSSe, because the expected carrier doping amount is 
comparable. Therefore, we consider that the different isotope effects were due to the modifications 
of electronic and/or phonon characteristics induced by structural symmetry breaking in the 
monoclinic phase. According to previous theoretical calculations for the tetragonal and 
monoclinic phases of La(O,F)BiS2, band splitting results from a structural transition from 
tetragonal (low-P phase) to monoclinic (high-P phase)38. In addition, the impact of interlayer 
coupling between two BiS2 layers, caused by the structural symmetry breaking, on the electronic 
states was suggested as a possibility. The switching of isotope effects between the tetragonal and 
monoclinic phases may be linked to the formation of the Bi–Bi bonding in the high-P phase in 
the present system. Let us remind that the theoretical study on the calculation of Tc for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 by Morice et al.24 was performed on a tetragonal unit cell. Their conclusion is 
consistent with the unconventional isotope effects observed in tetragonal La(O,F)BiSSe and 
Bi4O4S3. If the same calculation of Tc could be performed on a monoclinic unit cell, a Tc of 10 K 
may be reproduced. For that, high-resolution structural analyses of the high-P phase of 
(Sr,La)FBiS2 are needed.  
 
In conclusion, we synthesised (Sr,La)FBiS2 polycrystalline samples with 32S and 34S 
isotope chemicals. With magnetisation measurements under high pressure, we investigated the 
sulphur isotope effects on Tc for a high-P phase of (Sr,La)FBiS2. As a conventional shift in Tc was 
observed, we suggested the importance of phonons for the pairing mechanisms for the high-P 
phase. Based on comparisons with isotope effects in La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, in which 
unconventional isotope effects have been observed, we suggest that structural symmetry breaking 


7 
 
from tetragonal to monoclinic is a key factor for the switch of the isotope effects in the BiCh2-
based superconductor family.  
 
 
Methods 
Polycrystalline samples of (Sr,La)FBiS2 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method 
in an evacuated quartz tube. Powders of La (99.9%), SrF2 (99%), and Bi (99.999%) were mixed 
with powders of 32S (ISOFLEX: 99.99%) or 34S (ISOFLEX: 99.26%) with a nominal composition 
of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 in an Ar-filled glove box. The mixed powder was pelletised, and sintered in an 
evacuated quartz tube at 700 oC for 20 h, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The 
obtained compounds were thoroughly mixed, ground, and sintered under the same conditions as 
the first sintering. Except for the starting materials, the synthesis method was the same as our 
recent study on (Sr,La)FBiS230. 
The phase purity and crystal structure of the (Sr,La)FBiS2 samples were examined by 
laboratory X-ray diffraction (XRD) by the θ-2θ method with Cu-Kα1 radiation on a SmartLab 
(RIGAKU) diffractometer. The schematic images of crystal structures were drawn by VESTA39 
using structural data refined by Rietveld refinement using RIETAN-FP40. Through the XRD 
analyses, Bi and LaF3 impurity phases were detected. The actual compositions of the examined 
samples were analysed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on a TM-3030 
instrument (Hitachi). The average value of xEDX was calculated using the data obtained for five 
points on the sample surface. Standard deviation was estimated and shown in Table I. Through 
the XRD analyses, small spots with La-rich compositions were found. The impurity phase will be 
LaF3, since a LaF3 phase was found in XRD. 
The temperature dependence of the magnetisation at ambient pressure and under high 
pressures was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) on 
MPMS-3 (Quantum Design) after zero-field cooling (ZFC). Hydrostatic pressures were generated 
by the MPMS high-pressure capsule cell made of nonmagnetic Cu-Be, as described in our recent 
high pressure study on (Sr,RE)FBiS230. The sample was immersed in a pressure transmitting 
medium (Daphene 7373) and covered with a Teflon cell. The pressure at low temperature was 
calibrated based on the superconducting transition temperature of the Pb manometer. The 
magnetisation data shown in this paper contains background magnetisation. For sample #32-1, 
the maximum pressure was lower than that for other samples, which is due to the setup of high-
pressure cell with a shorter piston stroke.

Fig. 1. Structural and compositional data for Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 samples with different isotope 
mass for sulphur. (a) Powder XRD patterns for #32-1, #32-2, #34-1, and #34-2. Numbers above 
the XRD pattern are Miller indices. Small amount of Bi and LaF3 impurities were detected for 
#34-1 as indicated by arrows. (b) Zoomed XRD patterns near the 102 and 004 peaks. (c) La 
concentration (x) analysed by EDX. (d-g) Schematic images of crystal structure of the low-P 
(tetragonal) phase and the high-P phase (monoclinic) of (Sr,La)FBiS2 and the tetragonal phase of 
La(O,F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3. To emphasise the presence of quasi-one-dimensional network in the 
monoclinic phase (e), only the shorter Bi-S bonds were depicted. For comparison of the isotope 
effect exponent () and the crystal structure, S for (Sr,La)FBiS2, Se for La(O,F)BiSSe26, and S 
for Bi4O4S327 (a half unit cell) are shown.

samples of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2. (a-d) Temperature dependences of magnetisation for 32-1, #32-2, #34-

(e) Pressure dependence of Tc. The inset shows the enlarged plot for the data of high-P phases. 
Note that the Tc for low-P phases was roughly estimated because of superconducting signals 
mixed with those of the high-P phase and the Pb manometer. See supplemental file for the 
estimation of the Tc for the low-P phase.

Methods for band calculations 
First-principles band calculations for Sr1-xLaxBiS2 and LaO1-xFxBiSSe were performed 
using the WIEN2k package1,2. We used a virtual crystal approximation to simulate partial 
substitution. Because of technical reasons concerning the virtual crystal approximation, we used 
Ba instead of Sr for (Sr,La)FBiS2. In the WIEN2k package, the virtual crystal approximation can 
be performed for elements adjacent to each other in the periodic table. We calculated the electronic 
band structure of (Sr,La)FBiS2 using the VASP package3,4, assuming virtual crystal approximation. 
We have confirmed that the electronic band structure is not strongly affected by the replacement 
of Sr by Ba in the calculations. The electronic band structures of Ba0.6La0.4FBiS2 and 
LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe were obtained by adopting the experimental lattice constants of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 
(#32-2: parameters shown in Table S1) and LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe5, respectively. We used RKmax = 7 
and a 18×18×5 k-mesh for self-consistent calculations, and adopted the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof 
exchange-correlation functional6 including the spin-orbit coupling.
