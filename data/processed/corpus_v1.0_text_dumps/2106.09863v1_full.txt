Abstract 
 Sm(O,F)BiS2 superconducting single crystals with various nominal F contents have 
been grown using KI-KCl flux. The solid solution limit of F at the O-site in 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was approximately less than 20 at%. F concentrations of 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were hardly controlled by nominal F contents. It suggests 
the existence of intrinsic stable phase. Superconductivity was shown at around 5 K. 
Superconducting transition temperature with zero resistivity were increased with 
increasing nominal F contents within less than 70 at% in O-site, despite similar F 
concentration and c-axis lattice constants.

Main text 
1. Introduction 
Superconductors with high transition temperature (Tc) are composed of an alternate 
stacking of a superconducting layer and a blocking layer structure, such as cuprate 
superconductors [1-3], and iron-based superconductors [4,5]. R(O,F)BiS2 (R: rare earth 
elements) superconductors also show similar stacking structure [6]. However, 
superconducting transition exhibits low temperature which is 2-5 K range [7]. 
Superconducting transition temperatures (Tc) of R(O,F)BiS2 are enhanced by chemical 
pressure, which is induced by substituting R-site elements with lanthanoid elements of 
smaller ion radii [7,8]. We focused on Sm substitution in R-site for R(O,F)BiS2, which 
ionic radius is smaller than that of other lanthanoid elements, such as La, Ce, Pr and Nd 
[6,9-11]. In consequence, Sm(O,F)BiS2 superconducting single crystals with 
approximately 17 at% F substituted in O-site were successfully grown using KI-KCl 
flux [12]. By G. S. Thakur at al., Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were successfully grown 
using CsCl-KCl flux [13]. In our experiment, exceedingly tiny Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals with the size of less than 20 μm and impurity phases such as Bi2S3 were 


obtained using CsCl-KCl flux. Perhaps, this reason is due to the molar ratio of 
CsCl-KCl flux. The CsCl : KCl molar ratio of our experiment and G. S. Thakur at al. 
experiment were 5 : 3 and 1 : 1, respectively. Our previous paper showed that 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals had been grown using KI-KCl flux [12]. Therefore, we 
employed KI-KCl flux for Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals growth.  
In this paper, we are interested in the relationship between F contents and 
superconducting properties for Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals. We report the growth of 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with various nominal F contents. Analytical compositions, 
c-axis lattice constants and superconducting properties of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals with various nominal F contents are investigated.  
 
2. Material and methods 
  Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were grown by using KI-KCl flux. The raw materials: 
Sm2S3 (99.9 % : Mitsuwa Chemicals Co., Ltd.), Bi2S3 (99.99 % : Kojundo Chemical 
Lab. Co., Ltd.), Bi2O3 (99.9 % : Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co., Ltd.), BiF3 (99.99 % : 
Rare Metallic Co., Ltd.), and Bi (99.999 % : Rare Metallic Co., Ltd.) were weighted to 


achieve the nominal composition of SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.2-0.8). The molar ratio of the 
KI-KCl flux was KI:KCl = 3:2 using KI (99.5 % : Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.) and KCl 
(99.5 % : Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). The mixture of raw materials (0.8 g) and KI-KCl 
flux (5.0 g) were ground using a mortar and pestle, and then sealed into an evacuated 
quartz tube (~10 Pa). The quartz tube was heated at 700 °C for 10 h, and subsequently 
cooled to 600 °C at the rate of 0.5 °C/h. Then, the sample was cooled to room 
temperature, while still in the furnace. The heated quartz tube was then opened in air, 
and the obtained materials were washed and filtered using distilled water to remove the 
KI-KCl flux. Single crystals growth condition except to the F contents is same to 
previous reports [12].  
X-ray diffraction (XRD, MultiFlex, Rigaku) using Cu Kα radiation was employed to 
identify the crystal structure and determine their orientation. The lattice constants were 
determined using X-ray diffraction with a two dimensional detector (Bruker D8). The 
compositional ratio of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was evaluated using 
energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS, Quantax 70, Bruker), and the 
microstructure was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi 


High-Technologies, TM3030). The obtained compositional values were normalized 
using the atomic content of S =2.00, while Sm and Bi were measured. On the other 
hand, the atomic ratio of O and F was determined using electron probe microanalysis 
(EPMA, JXA-8200, JEOL). Those standard samples were Bi2O3 and PbF2 for O and F, 
respectively. The number of analyzed points was around three to five in the crystal. The 
estimated values were normalized using the atomic content of O + F = 1.00. Atomic 
content of each element is defined as CXX (XX: symbol of element). In particular, the 
normalized analytical F content is defined as “y” which was same meaning of CF. 
Actually, F contents were dramatically different between nominal and analytical 
composition, which were defined as “x” and “y”, respectively.  
The valence states of the Sm components in the obtained single crystals were 
estimated by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) analysis of Sm-L3 edges using an 
Aichi XAS beam-line with a synchrotron X-ray radiation (BL05S1: Experimental 
No.201905108).  
The resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) characteristics of the obtained single crystals were 
measured using the standard four-probe method, in constant current density (J) mode, 


employing the physical property measurement system (PPMS DynaCool, Quantum 
Design). 
The 
electrical 
terminals 
were 
fabricated 
using 
Ag 
paste. 
The 
superconductivity-onset temperature (Tc
onset) is defined as the temperature where the 
normal conducting state deviates from linear behavior in the ρ-T characteristics. The 
zero-resistivity critical temperature (Tc
zero) is defined as the temperature at which 
resistivity is lower than 20 μΩcm. The Tc
onset with applied various magnetic fields were 
measured from the ρ-T characteristics under a magnetic fields (H) perpendicular to the 
c-axis and parallel to the c-axis with range of 0.1-9.0 T, and then the upper critical field 
values of each magnetic fields direction, H┴c-axis
C2 and H//c-axis
C2 were estimated from the 
linear extrapolations of those Tc
onset data. The superconducting anisotropy (γs) was 
calculated from two kinds of methods which were ratio of upper critical field (H┴c-axis
C2 
and H//c-axis
C2) and effective mass model [14-16].  
 
3. Results and discussion 
The single crystals of Sm(O,F)BiS2 were grown, only in the range of x = 0.3-0.8 of 
SmO1-xFxBiS2. We tried to grow the x = 0.2 sample. However, the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 


crystals were not obtained, whereas Bi2S3 crystals and Sm-O-S-F impurities (Note: The 
typical atomic composition of Sm-O-S-F impurity was detected to be roughly Sm:O:S = 
2:1:1 with included small amount fluorine by EDS analysis. However, this impurity 
phase could not be identified.) were synthesized. Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image 
of Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals. The obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals have a 
platy-shape with size of 0.3-0.5 mm and thickness of 10-20 μm, and side faces are 
ill-defined. According to XRD data, c-plane is well-developed. In other words, the 
grown crystals have the c-axis perpendicular to the c-plane. The a-axis lattice constants 
were also tried to measure using X-ray diffraction with a two dimensional detector. 
However, they were not able to be estimated due to their particularly thin character 
along the a-axis direction in the obtained single crystals. X-ray powder diffraction was 
also tried using the crushed Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals. However, reactions yield of 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was a few mass% which was too little amount for X-ray 
powder diffraction measurement. Main phase, analytical compositions and c-axis lattice 
constants of the obtained single crystals are listed in Table I. The atomic ratios of Sm, 
Bi and S approximately corresponded with nominal compositions in all samples, 


respectively. K, I and Cl from the flux were not detected in the single crystals at the 
minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 wt%. On the other hand, averaged values of analytical 
F contents (y) of x = 0.3 and x = 0.4-0.8 were y = 0.13 and y = 0.16-0.19, respectively 
(Table I). This result suggests that the solid solution limit of F at the O site is 
approximately less than 20 at% in the Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals. On the other hand, 
the lower limit of F may be approximately 13 at%. However, those values have a large 
margin of error using EPMA, and then analytical F contents of the all samples become 
same within the error range. Moreover, differences of the c-axis lattice constants in all 
samples were not observed within the error range. These results suggest that 
approximately 20 at% F substituted Sm(O,F)BiS2 has possibility to be of intrinsic stable 
phase. Therefore, F concentrations and c-axis lattice constants of Sm(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals are hardly controlled by nominal F contents.  
Then, the valence states of the Sm components in the obtained single crystals were 
evaluated by XAS. Figure 2 shows the Sm L3-edge absorption spectra of the 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.3 and 0.5 at room temperature obtained by XAS 
analysis. Sm L3-edge showed a peak at 6719 eV, which can be assigned to a trivalent 


electronic configuration (Sm3+). This is consistent with the other XAS results for Sm3+ 
[17]. The associated absorption-edge spectra of both samples (x = 0.3 and 0.5) show 
similar peak shape. This result suggests the same valence state that is characteristic for 
mainly trivalent electronic configuration (Sm3+).  
The temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ-T) for obtained 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were shown in Figure 3. All samples exhibited metallic 
behavior, and superconductivity was shown at around 4.5 K. Superconducting transition 
temperatures with zero resistivity (Tc
zero) are increased with increasing nominal F 
contents within less than x = 0.7, and then shift to decrease within more than x = 0.8. 
The superconducting transition temperatures within x = 0.3-0.8 range changed despite 
similar analytical F contents and c-axis lattice constants. If superconducting transition 
temperatures of those samples were the same, they should decrease with increasing the 
measurement current densities (J). However, those superconducting transition 
temperatures have no clear relation with the experimental current densities (J) which 
were shown in Table II. Therefore, the change of superconducting transition 
temperatures may be originated from other properties of the obtained single crystals. 


For comparison, the superconducting transition width with x = 0.5, 0.7 and 0.8 are 
broader than those of x = 0.3, 0.4 and 0.6. The main reason for this observation could be 
the inhomogeneous F distribution in the single crystals. More specifically, these results 
indicate that superconducting transition temperatures are depended on the nominal F 
contents. At this moment, the origin of various superconducting transition temperature 
is unclear. Although, we predict that a-axis lattice constants or crystallinity are 
dominant in superconducting transition temperature for Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals.  
The ρ-T characteristics of the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.3 below 
10 K under magnetic fields (H) of 0.1-9.0 T, which were perpendicular to the c-axis (H 
┴ c-axis) and parallel to the c-axis (H // c-axis) are presented in Figs. 4(a) and (b), 
respectively. The suppression of superconducting transition temperature under the effect 
of H // c-axis was more significant than that attributed to the H ┴ c-axis. Tc
onset was 
estimated from Fig. 4, and the field dependences of Tc
onset under the effects of the H ┴ 
c-axis and H // c-axis are plotted in Fig. 5. From the linear extrapolations of the Tc
onset 
data, the upper critical field values, H┴c-axis
C2 and H//c-axis
C2, were predicted to be 35 and 
1.1 T, respectively. The upper critical field values of another nominal F contents 


samples were also estimated using same way. The upper critical field values of each 
magnetic fields direction, H┴c-axis
C2 and H//c-axis
C2 for all samples were estimated to be 
29-43 T and 1.0-1.4 T, respectively. These results indicate that the obtained 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals exhibit high superconducting anisotropy. We determined 
the superconducting anisotropy (γs) using the ratio of upper critical field (H┴c-axis
C2 
divided by H//c-axis
C2) or an effective mass model [14]. γs was calculated by the upper 
critical fields according to Eq. (1):  
γs = H┴c-axis
C2/H//c-axis
C2.            (1) 
On the other hand, γs was also evaluated using the effective mass model [14]. The 
angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) was measured at various magnetic fields (H) 
values in the vertices liquid state to estimate γs of the obtained single crystals [15,16]. 
The reduced field (Hred) was evaluated using Eq. (2) for the effective mass model: 
Hred = H(sin2θ + γs
-2cos2θ)1/2,          (2) 
where θ is the angle between the c-plane and magnetic field [14]. The γs value was 
estimated using the best scaling of the graph illustrating the ρ-Hred relationship. Figure 
6(a) shows the angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) at various magnetic fields (H = 


0.1-9.0 T) in vertices liquid state (3 K) for the grown Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with x 
= 0.3. The ρ-θ curve exhibited almost two-fold symmetry. The ρ-Hred scaling obtained 
from Fig. 6(a) using Eq. (2) is presented in Fig. 6(b). The best scaling was obtained for 
γs = 20, as shown in Fig. 6(b). However, this plot was deviated from the scaling at 
higher magnetic fields. The γs from effective mass model of another nominal F contents 
samples were also evaluated using the same way, and then they exhibited similar 
behavior. For the obtained Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals, γs values from the ratio of upper 
critical fields were estimated as higher than those obtained from effective mass model. 
These values were shown in Table II. The γs values showed the same trend as in the 
previous report [12]. Measurement current densities (J), superconducting transition 
temperature (Tc
onset and Tc
zero), upper critical fields (H┴c-axis
C2 and H//c-axis
C2) and 
superconducting anisotropies γs (determined from upper critical field and effective mass 
model) are listed in Table II. In a conventional (BCS-like) superconductor at the 
weak-coupling limit, the Pauli limit (Hp) is calculated to be 9.2-10.1 T, since Hp = 1.84 
Tc, (Tc
onset = 5.0-5.5 K) [18]. Thus, the upper critical field in the c-plane (H┴c-axis
C2 = 
29-46 T) is significantly higher than the Pauli limit (Hp = 9.2-10.1 T), indicating the 


possibility of an unconventional superconductor. On the other hand, the upper critical 
fields and superconducting anisotropies have no observed correlations within x = 
0.3-0.8 range, but the values of those superconducting parameters exhibited some 
differences. The obtained chemical state such as c-axis lattice constants and analytical F 
contents were similar within those nominal F contents ranges. The origin of the 
differences of those superconducting parameters among each nominal sample F 
contents may be other chemical parameters. At a minimum, analytical F contents had 
similar value which was approximately 20 at%. It strongly suggests the possibility of 
the existence of intrinsic stable phase for Sm(O,F)BiS2. Thus this predicts that 
approximately 20 at% F substituted structure is fairly stable phase in Sm(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals. However, the proposition of the relationship between superconducting 
properties and chemical states for Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was also given. Further 
characterizations of Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are therefore necessary to clarify this 
proposition. Additional investigations such as a-axis lattice constants and elemental 
deficiency are also required.  
 


4. Conclusions 
 We have successfully grown Sm(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with the nominal 
compositions of SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.3-0.8) using KI-KCl flux. The solid solution limit 
of F at the O site is approximately less than 20 at%. The difference of c-axis lattice 
constants could not be observed in the all samples. But analytical F contents were 
similar value which was approximately 20 at% F substitution in O-site. Therefore, 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 with approximately 20 at% F substitution has possibility to be of intrinsic 
stable phase. In consequence, F concentrations and c-axis lattice constants are hardly 
controlled by nominal F contents. On the other hand, the peak shape of associated 
absorption-edge spectra for Sm was almost the same between x = 0.3 and 0.5, which 
was mainly trivalent electronic configuration (Sm3+). Superconducting transition 
temperature were increased with increasing nominal F contents within less than x = 0.7 
despite similar chemical properties. The upper critical fields and superconducting 
anisotropies showed no remarkable tendencies regardless of the various nominal F 
contents within x = 0.3-0.8 range. However, values of those superconducting parameters 
exhibited some differences. Those observations may be originated from other chemical 


parameters such as a-axis lattice constants, elemental deficiency and so on.
