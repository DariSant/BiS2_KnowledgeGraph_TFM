Through a combination of X-ray diﬀraction, electrical transport, magnetic susceptibility, and
heat capacity measurements, we report the eﬀect of La doping on Sr in the newly discovered
SrFBiS2 system. Superconducting transition with critical temperature Tc of 2.8 K, developed from a
semiconducting-like normal state, was found in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2. A strong diamagnetic signal and a
clear speciﬁc heat anomaly associated with this transition were observed, conﬁrming bulk supercon-
ductivity. The upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(0) was estimated to be 1 Tesla by using the Ginzburg-Landau
approach. Our experiments therefore demonstrate that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by
electron doping in the SrFBiS2 system.

Superconductivity within layered crystal structure has
attracted sustained interest in the community of corre-
lated electron systems, primarily due to the exotic super-
conducting properties they exhibit. Notable examples in-
clude the high-Tc cuprates with the CuO2 plane and the
Fe-based superconductors with Fe2An2 (An = P, As, Se)
superconducting(SC) layers. Recently, superconductiv-
ity in the novel BiS2-based superconductor Bi4O4S3 with
a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 8.6 K
has been reported.1 Immediately following this result,
several LnO1−xFxBiS2(Ln=La, Ce, Pr, Nd) supercon-
ductors, with the highest Tc of 10 K,2–6 have been then
discovered. While Tc is largely determined by [Ln2O2]2−
blocking layer in these systems, all these superconduc-
tors share the common BiS2 layer. Although these BiS2-
based layered superconductors show a wealth of similari-
ties to the iron pnictides, some diﬀerences are also mani-
fest. First, the parent compound LnOBiS2 is a bad metal
without detectable antiferrimagnetic transition or struc-
ture phase transition, implying that magnetism is of less
importance to superconductivity in BiS2-based systems.
Second, resistivity measurements in BiS2-based systems
suggest that superconductivity appears in close proxim-
ity to an insulating normal state for the optimal super-
conducting sample,5 in sharp contrast to the iron based
superconductors where superconductivity grows from a
metallic state. Interestingly, pairing symmetry in layered
BiS2-based compounds has yet to be determined albeit
some theorists conjectured that BiS2 based compounds
are strongly electron-phonon coupled superconductors,
and the pairing symmetry may be an extended s-wave
with full gaps on diﬀerent parts of Fermi surfaces,7,8 in
analogy to the iron-based superconductors.9,10 However,
the experimental evidence of pairing symmetry is still
lacking thus far.
Very recently, a new BiS2 based layered compound
SrFBiS2 has been reported.11 This compound is isostruc-
tural to LaOBiS2, with the [Ln2O2]2−layer being re-
placed by iso-charged [Sr2F2]2−block, similar to the case
of LaOFeAs and SrFFeAs.
The resistivity of SrFBiS2
shows the semiconducting behavior, however, no super-
conductivity has been reported in this system.
In the paper, we report the successful synthesis and the
detailed characterization of La-doped Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 (x
= 0, 0.5) samples. The parent compound SrFBiS2 ex-
hibits thermally excited resistivity down to low tempera-
ture, consistent with the existing literature.11 As x = 0.5,
resistivity at normal state still shows the semiconduct-
ing behavior, but its absolute value drops by a factor of
2, followed by a sharp superconducting transition below
2.8 K. The strong diamagnetic signal and a clear speciﬁc
heat jump provide compelling evidence of bulk supercon-
ductivity in Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 system. Finally, the speciﬁc
heat data show evidence of strong-coupling nature of the
observed superconductivity.
The polycrystalline samples of Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 (x =
0, 0.5) used in this study were synthesized by two-step
solid state reaction method. The starting materials, La
pieces, SrF2 powder, Bi and S powder are all of high
purity (≥99.9%). Firstly, La2S3 was pre-synthesized by
reacting stoichiometric S powder and La pieces at 873
K for 10 hours. After that, the as-grown La2S3 and the
powder of SrS, SrF2, Bi, and S as starting material were
weighted according to their stoichiometric ratio and then
fully ground in an agate mortar. The mixture of pow-
der was then pressed into pellets, heated in an evacuated
quartz tube at 1073 K for 10 hours and ﬁnally furnace-
cooled to room temperature. The whole process was re-
peated once again in order to get the pure phase.
Crystal structure characterization was performed by
powder X-ray diﬀraction (XRD) at room temperature
using a D/Max-rA diﬀractometer with Cu Kα radiation
and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters were
obtained by Rietveld reﬁnements. The electrical resistiv-


2
ity was measured with a standard four-terminal method
covering temperature range from 0.4 to 300 K in a com-
mercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system with a 3He re-
frigeration insert. Speciﬁc heat and Hall eﬀect measure-
ments were also performed in this system. The tempera-
ture dependence of d.c. magnetization was measured on
a Quantum Design MPMS-5.

Figure 1 (a) shows the powder XRD patterns of the
Sr1−xLaxFBiS2 (x=0, 0.5) samples. Overall, the main
diﬀraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed
based on a tetragonal cell structure with the P4/nmm
space group. Extra minor peaks arising from impurity
phase of Bi2S3 can also be seen. The content of impu-
rity phase Bi2S3 estimated by Rietveld ﬁtting is about
15% and 12% for parent compound(x = 0) and x = 0.5
sample, respectively. The lattice parameters of the par-
ent compound SrFBiS2 are extracted to be a = 4.0820˚A
and c = 13.8025˚A by Rietveld ﬁtting, in good agree-
ment with the previous report.11 For the La-doped sam-
ple, however, the (00l) peaks shift discernibly towards
higher 2θ angles, suggesting the smaller c-axis constant.
Thus, while the a-axis lattice parameter increases slightly
to 4.0822˚A in the La-doped sample, the c-axis decreases
signiﬁcantly to 13.335˚A, implying that the La impurity
was indeed doped into the lattice, given that the ionic ra-
dius of La ion is known to be smaller than that of Sr. This
is quite similar to the case of LaO1−xFxBiS2.4 The resul-
tant crystal structure is therefore schematically shown in
the Fig.1(b), which is composed of stacked rock-salt-type
BiS2 layer alternating with ﬂuorite-type SrF layer along
the c-axis.
The zero-ﬁeld temperature dependence of the electri-
cal resistivity (ρ) of these two samples is plotted in Fig.
2(a). For the parent SrFBiS2 compound, the resistivity
clearly shows thermally activated behavior with decreas-
ing temperature from 300 K, and no resistivity anomaly
can be observed down to 2 K. The thermal activation
energy (Ea) obtained by ﬁtting with the thermal activa-
tion formula ρ(T ) = ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT ) for the temperature
range from 100 K to 300 K is about 38.2 meV, consis-
tent with previous studies.11 However, it is noted that
its absolute value is nearly two thirds smaller than the
reported value by Lei et al.11 We attribute this to the
impurity phase of Bi2S3 with sulfur deﬁciency12 in our
sample which may decrease the absolute value of resis-
tivity. As Sr is partially replaced by La (x = 0.5), the
resistivity remains semiconducting-like at high tempera-
tures, with the magnitude of resistivity substantially re-
duced compared to the undoped sample. Meanwhile, the
Ea ﬁtted at high temperature also decreases to 8.6 meV,
suggesting the decrease of gap size because of electron
doping. With further cooling down, a sharp supercon-
ducting transition with Tc of 2.8 K is clearly seen. This
result is reminiscent of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, where the normal
state shows semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes
superconducting transition below
10 K.2 Interestingly,
the ﬁrst principles calculations7 has suggested that there
may be a charge density wave instability or an enhanced
correlation eﬀect in this system. Yet, no such instability
can be detected merely from the resistivity measurement
given in this study.
Figure 2 (b) shows the close-up view of the low-
temperature resistivity for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 samples un-
der various magnetic ﬁelds below 4 K. The inset gives
the temperature dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld
µ0Hc2(T ), determined by using 90% normal state re-
sistivity criterion.
The temperature dependence of
µ0Hc2(T ) is nearly linear in the temperature range stud-
ied.
According to Ginzburg-Landau theory, the upper
critical ﬁeld Hc2 evolves with temperature following the
formula:
Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)(1 −t2)/(1 + t2),
(1)
where t is the renormalized temperature T/Tc.
It is
found that the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 as drawn can be
well ﬁtted by this model and its zero temperature limit
is estimated to be 1.04 T.
In order to verify the bulk nature of the observed super-
conductivity, the temperature dependence of d.c. mag-
netic susceptibility was measured under 5 Oe magnetic
ﬁeld with both zero ﬁeld cooling (ZFC) and ﬁeld cooling
(FC) modes for the superconducting samples. The strong
diamagnetic signal was observed for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2
sample.
The Tc value determined from the magnetic
susceptibility agrees well with the one extracted from
the resistivity data. The estimated volume fraction of
magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 30%, bearing
out the bulk superconductivity. Note that the Meissner
volume fraction estimated by FC measurement data also
exceeds 20%, indicating the high quality superconducting
sample.
To further study its superconducting properties, the
speciﬁc heat measurement of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample was
performed in the temperature range from 0.5 K to 5 K.
As plotted in Fig. 4, a clear speciﬁc-heat jump can be
observed at Tc = 2.8 K, further conﬁrming the bulk su-

perconductivity. Below 1.5 K, however, the low temper-
ature heat capacity undergoes a moderate upturn which
very likely arises from Schottky anomaly associated with
the impurities phase or the freezing out of La nuclear
spins.13 Taking into account the Schottky anomaly com-
ponent, the overall speciﬁc heat can be written as:
C/T = γ + βT 2 + α/T 3
(2)
where γ and βT 2 account for the electronic and lattice
contributions respectively, and the last term, α/T 3, is
the Schottky anomaly. The plot of C/T-α/T 3 versus T 2
shows a linear behavior in the high temperature range
from 2.9 to 5 K (data not explicitly shown here). The re-
sultant electronic coeﬃcient γ and the lattice coeﬃcient
β are 1.42 mJ/ mol K2 and β = 0.414 mJ/ mol K4 re-
spectively. The Debye temperature is then estimated to
be 265 K. This value is somewhat smaller that those of
LaONiAs,14 LaOFeP15 and LaO0.89F0.11FeAs.16 The lat-
tice contribution was further subtracted in the inset in

order to see the clear speciﬁc heat jump at the SC tran-
sition. The corresponding electronic speciﬁc jump at Tc,
therefore, is estimated to be ∆Ce/γTc = 1.4, very close
to the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieﬀer (BCS)
value of 1.43. Considering the relatively low volume frac-
tion of magnetic shielding suggested from susceptibility
measurement, the real size of ∆Ce/γTc ought to be
much larger than the BCS value, implying that SC in
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 likely involves a strong electron-phonon
coupling, consistent with the theoretical prediction.7

Finally, the temperature dependence of Hall coeﬃcient

indicating that electron-type charge carrier is dominant
in this sample.

temperature regime, and drops drastically below 50 K.
The result reminds us of the similar behavior observed in
iron-based SC, where RH decreases sharply due to spin
density wave(SDW) formation.18 In the present sample,
however, no SDW/CDW anomaly has been observed in
the measurements of resistivity and magnetization. On
the other hand, it is known that the inherent impurity
phase may act to smear out the anomalies in the resistiv-
ity and susceptibility. In this regard, it would be interest-
ing to clarify this problem by ﬁrst principles calculations7
or further improving the sample quality. In a single band
metal, the Hall coeﬃcient RH is associated with car-
rier density (n) as RH = 1/ne. We therefore estimate
the charge carrier density to be 1.05×1019/cm3 at 5 K,
which is similar to the Bi4O4S3 system17 and iron based
superconductors19 with a very low superﬂuid density. In
addition, we can not rule out the multi-band eﬀect,5 as
the origin of the drop in RH.
In summary, we study the electron doping eﬀect, i.e.,
partially substituting La for Sr, in the newly discov-
ered SrFBiS2 system.
The parent compound shows
semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing temper-
ature. Via electron doping, we discovered a new BiS2-
based superconductor Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with a Tc as high
as 2.8 K. Importantly, this superconductivity was found
to develop on the background of insulating normal state,
raising a question of whether this superconductor is in
proximity to a Mott insulator or a band insulator. Based
on the heat capacity measurement, we speculate that
the superconducting electron pairs might have a strong-
coupled nature.
In this regard, it would certainly be
interesting to identify the symmetry of superconducting
order parameter in this system along with other BiS2-
based superconductors.
We would like to thank Chao Cao for discussions.
