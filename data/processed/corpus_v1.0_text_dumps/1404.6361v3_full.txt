Abstract 
Recently, several types of BiS2-based superconductor such as Bi4O4S3, 
REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth) and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 have been discovered. In this study, 
we have investigated the crystal structure and the superconducting properties for 
two kinds of polycrystalline samples (As-grown and high-pressure-annealed 
samples) of the BiS2-based superconductor CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. We found that both the 
As-grown and the high-pressure-annealed CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples show bulk 
superconductivity. A higher Tc was observed in the high-pressure-annealed sample. 
The Tc of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 increased from Tc
zero = 2.7 K to Tc
zero = 3.7 K by 
high-pressure annealing. The lattice constant of a and c axis did not show 
remarkable differences between the As-grown and the high-pressure-annealed 
samples. Nevertheless, the peak symmetry of the (200) peak seemed to become 
more symmetric while the (004) peak did not show such a difference, indicating that 
the crystal structure within the ab plane changed to a higher-symmetric phase, a 
perfect tetragonal, by high-pressure annealing in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2.

1. Introduction 
 Recently, several types of BiS2-based superconductor such as Bi4O4S3,1) 
REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth), 2-6) and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 
7,8) have been discovered. The 
typical parent material LaOBiS2 has a crystal structure composed of an alternate 
stacking of BiS2 conduction layers and LaO blocking layers. Electron carriers, which 
are essential for the appearance of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family, can be 
controlled by manipulating the structure and composition at the blocking layers. In 
LaOBiS2, electron carriers can be generated by a partial substitution of O2- by F-.2,9) 
Electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility measurements under high pressure 
revealed that the transition temperature (Tc) of the BiS2-based family was sensitive to 
application of external pressure and can be significantly increased11-13) as observed in 
the Fe-based superconductor family.14-17)
 
In addition, superconducting properties of the BiS2-based superconductors strongly 
depend on the sample preparation method. Solid-state-reacted (As-grown) LaO1-xFxBiS2 
shows filamentary superconductivity: in other words, the superconducting volume 
fraction is obviously low, whereas superconducting states are evidently generated. To 
induce bulk superconductivity, high pressure annealing is effective.2,10) Using the 
high-pressure technique, the onset of Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 reaches a value of 11 K. It 
was suggested that the crystal structure obviously changed after high-pressure annealing. 
Recently, we revealed that uniaxial lattice contraction generated along the c axis was 
positively linked to the enhancement of Tc in high-pressure-annealed LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2.18,19)  
In this study, we focus on CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. In the previous studies, it was reported that 
As-grown CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 does not show bulk superconductivity.3,4) In addition, the 
magnetic ordering, which was regarded as a ferromagnetic ordering, was observed. Bulk 
superconductivity is induced by application of high pressure11) or annealing the 
As-grown samples under high pressure (high-pressure annealing).4) Interestingly, it was 
found that the magnetic ordering at the blocking layer (Ce moment) and bulk 
superconductivity at the BiS2 layer could coexist. So far, the correlation between the 
superconducting properties and the crystal structure under high pressure in 
CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 remains to be clarified. In this article, we have investigated the 


3 
 
correlation between the crystal structure and the superconducting properties of the 
As-grown and the high-pressure-annealed CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples. 
 
2. Experimental detail 
Polycrystalline samples of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 were prepared by a solid-state reaction 
using powders of Bi2O3 (99.9 %), BiF3 (99.9 %), Bi2S3, Ce2S3 (99.9 %), and grains of Bi 
(99.99 %). The Bi2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Bi (99.99 %) and S (99.99 %) 
grains in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals used in this study were purchased 
from Kojundo-Kagaku Laboratory. The starting materials with a nominal composition 
of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 were mixed-well, pressed in pellets, sealed in an evacuated quartz 
tube and heated at 700 ºC for 10 h. The obtained products were ground, sealed into an 
evacuated quartz tube and heated again under the same heating condition to obtain a 
homogenized sample; in this article, we call this sample As-grown sample. The obtained 
sample was annealed at about 600 ºC under a high pressure of about 3 GPa for 1 h using 
a cubic-anvil high-pressure synthesis instrument; in this article, we call this material HP 
sample. All the obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction using the 
θ−2θ method with a CuKα radiation. The temperature dependence of electrical 
resistivity was measured using the four-terminal method. The temperature dependence 
of magnetization was measured using a superconducting quantum interface device 
(SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 5 Oe after both zero-field cooling 
(ZFC) and field cooling (FC). 
 
3. Results and discussion  
Figure 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the As-grown and the HP samples 
of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. Almost all of the obtained X-ray peaks were explained using the 
tetragonal P4/nmm space group. The numbers displayed in the profile indicate Miller 
indices. The obtained X-ray profiles are quite similar, but the peaks of the HP sample 
are slightly broadened. To discuss the change of the lattice constants in detail, the 
enlarged X-ray profiles around the (004) peaks and the (200) peaks are shown in Figs. 


4 
 
1(b) and 1(c), respectively. To clarify the changes in X-ray peaks, the peak intensities of 
(102) in Fig. 1(b) and (200) in Fig. 1(c) were normalized to 1, respectively. The (004) 
and (200) peak position does not show a remarkable differences between the As-grown 
and the HP samples. The lattice constants estimated from the peak positions are a = 
4.0477 Å and c = 13.429 Å for the As-grown sample, and a = 4.0477 Å and c = 13.429 
Å for the HP sample. The calculated lattice constants for the As-grown and the HP 
samples are the same within the resolution of our Laboratory level X-ray diffraction 
instrument. 
Nevertheless, it can be noted that the shape of the (200) peak of the As-grown sample 
is relatively asymmetric. The (200) peak has a small hump around 2θ = 45º, which 
indicates that the ab-plane could be strained, and the crystal structure symmetry would 
be not a perfect tetragonal for the As-grown sample. In contrast, the hump structure 
disappears in the (200) peak of the HP sample. These facts indicate that the crystal 
structure changes to a higher-symmetric phase (more perfect tetragonal) by 
high-pressure annealing in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. In addition, the (004) peaks for both samples 
are almost symmetric, which indicates that there is no change in the structure symmetry 
and/or lattice strain along the c axis. 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for the As-grown 
and the HP samples of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 below 15 K. The As-grown sample shows 
zero-resistivity states below Tc
zero = 2.7 K. The HP sample shows zero-resistivity states 
below Tc
zero = 3.7 K. It is hard to define the onset of Tc in the resistivity measurements 
because the resistivity for both samples gradually begins to decrease below ~ 8 K. The 
broad transition is caused by the sensitivity of the superconducting properties to the 
change in the local crystal structures or strain. 
Figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of magnetization for (a) the As-grown 
and (b) the HP samples of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. For both samples, magnetic ordering was 
observed below a magnetic transition temperature of 7.5 K as reported in the previous 
studies.3,4) The magnetic transition temperature does not change by high-pressure 
annealing. The As-grown sample shows the superconducting Tc
mag of 2.7 K, while the 


5 
 
HP sample shows the superconducting Tc
mag of 3.5 K. These results almost correspond 
to the Tc
zero observed in the resistivity measurements for the As-grown and the HP 
samples. A large shielding volume fraction is observed in the ZFC data at 2 K for both 
samples, indicating both samples show bulk superconductivity. 
The fact that the As-grown sample shows bulk superconductivity seems to be 
inconsistent with the previous works.3,4) We consider the difference in the observed 
properties of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 between this study and the previous studies was due to the 
difference of the sample synthesis conditions. In fact, the annealing temperature is 
different. As shown in the X-ray diffraction part, the changes in the crystal structure 
after high-pressure annealing are not obvious as compared to the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
in which a large uniaxial contraction along the c axis is observed for the HP sample.18) 
Therefore, a slight change in the crystal structure could induce bulk superconductivity 
in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. Then, bulk superconducting states are realized in the As-grown 
sample by optimizing the synthesis temperature. 
To understand the increase in Tc by high-pressure annealing in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2, we 
suggest two possibilities. The first scenario is the slight change in the lattice symmetry 
within the ab plane. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the shape of the (200) peak of the As-grown 
sample is relatively asymmetric, and the (200) peak becomes symmetric by 
high-pressure annealing. A higher symmetry within the ab plane may be important for 
raising Tc in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. The other possibility is that the atoms locally moved 
without any changes in lattice constants by high-pressure annealing. For example, the z 
coordinate of the interlayer S site could easily move or fluctuate because the S2- is 
combined with not only Bi in the superconducting layer but also Ce in the blocking 
layer. If this scenario is real, the electronic states which enhance superconducting 
properties could be modified without any change in lattice constants. 
 
4. Conclusion 
 We investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of the 
As-grown and HP samples of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. We found that both As-grown and HP 
samples show bulk superconductivity. The lattice constant of a and c axis does not 
show a remarkable differences between the As-grown and HP samples. Nevertheless, 
the peak symmetry of the (200) peak seems to become more symmetric by 


6 
 
high-pressure annealing while the (004) peak does not show such a difference, 
indicating that the crystal structure within the ab plane changed to a 
higher-symmetric phase, more perfect tetragonal, by high-pressure annealing in 
CeO0.3F0.7BiS2. The Tc of CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 increased from Tc
zero = 2.7 K to Tc
zero = 3.7 
K by high-pressure annealing. We assume that the increase in Tc could be explained 
by a change in the crystal structure symmetry within the ab plane or optimization of 
the local atomic coordinates without any changes in lattice constants.
