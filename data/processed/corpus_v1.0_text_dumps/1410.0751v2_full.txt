Abstract 
Crystal structure and properties of a new member of oxy-bismuth-sulfide family SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 
are reported here. The compounds SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.0 and 0.5) are isostructural with LaOBiS2 
and crystallize in the CeOBiS2 type structure (P4/nmm). Sm substitution in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, (La1-
ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2), leads to a gradual decrease in a-lattice constant however the c-lattice constant 
does not show such a gradual trend. Enhancement in Tc is achieved upon partially substituting La 
by smaller Sm ion. Maximum Tc ~ 4.6 K was observed for composition with y = 0.8. Disobeying 
this trend Tc disappears unexpectedly in composition SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 1.0). Both the undoped 
and F-doped (x = 0.0 and 0.5) compounds are paramagnetic exhibiting semiconducting behavior 
down to 2 K.

Introduction 
Research in inorganic materials throws up unprecedented structures with unusual properties. The 
persistence of scientists carrying out exploratory research is challenging amidst dwindling 
recognition to this genre of scientists. Compounds like Gd2Cl3,1 NaMo4O6,2 YBa2Cu3O7,3 
K3C60,4 TlCaBa2Cu2O8,5 CaCu3Ti4O12,
6 are compositions which rarely can be designed, but were 
synthesized by the unparalleled intuition (read ingenuity) and labour of solid state scientists 
which occasionally rewarded them with footprints for unusual material properties, like high 
temperature superconductivity, colossal magnetoresistance, unusually high dielectric constant, 
negative index of refraction, etc. This article follows from our work related to a recent class of 
superconductors, Bi4O4S3 and LnOBiS2 which have some structural similarity to the important 
LnOFeAs class of superconductors.7-10 For example both these systems crystallize in the same 
space group (P4/nmm), they have layered structure with a charge reservoir layer (LnO) and a 
superconducting layer (BiS2, Fe-As), their parent phases are semiconducting or poorly 
conducting and, most importantly, they become superconducting upon electron-doping (doping 
F- for O2- or a tetravalent ion for Ln).9-17 Superconductivity by fluorine - doping in LaO1-xFxBiS2 
was first reported by Mizuguchi et al (Tc ~ 2.5 K)9 ( Tc ~10 K could be achieved by high pressure 
synthesis).9 Superconductivity in LnO1-xFxBiS2 with Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd and Yb also followed 
soon.10-16 Tc is enhanced by chemical pressure18-20 or external applied pressure22-27 as observed 
for LnOFeAs28 for example in LnO1-xFxBiS2, a slight enhancement in Tc has been reported by 
substituting Se at the S sites or by inter-mixing rare earth ions.18-21 Hole doping via alkali earth- 
metal-substitution at Ln–site did not yield superconductivity.22, 29 This is in contrast to what is 
observed in LnOFeAs where hole doping also induces superconductivity.30-32 Electronic structure

of these chalcogenides is comparable to that of pnictides and is greatly influenced by doping.33-34 
Their bands near the Fermi level consist of states predominantly arising from Bi (6p) and S (3p) 
states and therefore the Bi–S layers are responsible for superconductivity in these materials, 
while the LnO layer serves as the charge reservoir layer.33-34 In this article we report: (1) the 
single crystal synthesis, structure and properties of a new member SmO1-xFxBiS2. It has been 
found to be non-superconducting down to 2 K. (2) we have systematically investigated the effect 
of doping smaller Sm ions at La sites in La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 and observed an enhancement in Tc 
with Sm substitution. 
Experimental 
Polycrystalline samples of La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 – 1.0) were synthesized by solid state 
method. Ln2S3, preheated Ln2O3, LnF3, Bi2S3, Bi and S were ground well and pelletized in the 
form of circular disks. These disks were then sealed in evacuated silica tubes and heated at 
800oC for 24 hours. The product was again ground, pelletized and heated at 800oC for 24 h for 
better homogeneity. The samples were stable in air but preserved in an Ar filled glove box to 
avoid any unnecessary contamination. 
Single crystals of SmO1-xFxBiS2 were grown using KCl-CsCl flux method. Polycrystalline SmO1-
xFxBiS2 was used as charge. Approximately 0.5g of compound was mixed with 2.5 g of KCl-
CsCl (1:1). The properly mixed powder was sealed in an evacuated silica tube. The tube was 
heated at 800oC for 24 h and cooled to 600oC at a rate of 2oC/hour. Then the furnace was shut off 
and allowed to cool naturally. The tube was opened in ambient atmosphere and the flux was 
dissolved in distilled water. The product was washed several times with distilled water and 


4 
 
finally rinsed with acetone. Many plate like micron sized (100-500 μm) crystals were obtained as 
observed under microscope. All the chemical manipulations except for vacuum sealing and 
washing of crystals were performed in an Ar filled glove box (H2O and O2< 0.1 ppm).  
The phase purity of all the samples was checked by powder X-ray diffraction technique using 
Cu-Kα radiation in a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer. Single-crystal diffraction data sets were 
collected at room temperature over a 2θ range of ~4° to ~60° with 0.5° scans in ω and 10 s per 
frame exposures with the aid of a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer equipped with Mo Kα 
radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The data showed a primitive tetragonal lattice and the intensity 
statistics indicated a centrosymmetric space group. The reflection intensities were integrated with 
the APEX II program in the SMART software package.35 Empirical absorption corrections were 
employed using the SADABS program.36 The space group P4/nmm (No. 129) of the structures 
was determined with the help of XPREP and SHELXTL 6.1.37 The structure was solved by 
direct methods and subsequently refined on |F2| with combinations of least squares refinements 
and difference Fourier maps. The refinements of SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 converged to R1 = 0.0662, RW = 
0.1203 for all data with goodness of fit 1.17 and maximum residuals of 3.9 and −2.9 e/Å3 that 
were 0.8 and 1.1 Å from Bi sites, respectively.  Rietveld refinement analysis was carried out on 
all the samples using Topas software package.38 
Magnetization measurements in the temperature range of 2 – 300 K on single crystals were 
performed by using a Quantum Design Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) 
and on the polycrystalline samples by a vibrating sample magnetometer using a Physical 
Property Measurement System (PPMS). The resistivity studies in the temperature range of 2 – 


5 
 
300 K on polycrystalline samples were carried out by conventional four probe method using a 
Quantum Design PPMS.  
Results and discussion  
1. SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.0, 0.5) 
The Rietveld refined powder X-ray diffraction pattern of polycrystalline SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is 
shown in figure 1. Most of the peaks could be easily indexed on the basis of a tetragonal system 
with CeOBiS2 structure in P4/nmm space group. Presence of small amount (< 10 %) of Bi2S3 
secondary phase was also detected which commonly occurs in these types of samples. The 
refined lattice parameters were found to be a = 4.0122(5) Å, c = 13.5949(2) Å for x = 0.0 and 
4.0180(1) Å and 13.5291(4) Å for x = 0.5. Crystallographic data obtained from single crystal 
analysis for SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is given in Table 1. The corresponding atomic positions and 
isothermal displacement parameters are listed in Table 2. The CIF file and anisotropic 
displacement parameters are provided in the Supporting Information.  It may be noted that due to 
similar scattering factors of O and F, their occupancies were not refined and were fixed to 
nominal values during refinement. SmO1-xFxBiS2 is isostructural to LaOBiS2 consisting of 
tetrahedral Sm2(O,F)2 and fluorite type BiS2 layers (inset fig 1). The average stoichiometry of the 
F-doped single crystal sample was confirmed by EDAX analysis, results of which are given in 
Supporting Information. The relative ratio of Sm:F:Bi:S was found to be 1:0.39:0.96:2.1. The 
value of in-plane or equatorial Bi–S bond length (Bi–Seq) was calculated to be 2.8423(2) Å and 
the S–Bi–S bond angle was 176.69 (4)o. A comparison of these bond lengths and bond angles of 
Sm(O,F)BiS2 with other F- doped LnOBiS2 including Bi4O4S3 is shown in figure 2. It is to be 


6 
 
noted that the value of ‘x’ in each LnO1-xFxBiS2 is the one which gives the maximum Tc. The 
values for Ln = La,39 (x = 0.46) and Nd14 (x = 0.3) were obtained from the single crystal data 
reported elsewhere and for SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 data from present studies were used. For Ce,10 (x = 
0.5), Pr11 (x = 0.5) and Bi4O4S3
7 the values were obtained from the data reported on 
polycrystalline samples. Since for Yb sample no structural refinement data has been reported, 
bond lengths and bond angles could not be calculated. An expected gradual decrease in both in–
plane Bi–S bond distance and S–Bi–S bond angle is seen with decreasing size of the rare earth 
ion from La to Nd. For Sm system the Bi–S bond length is anomalously higher than Nd and 
which is a matter of further investigation. Chen, et al,29 studied the effect of local distortion in 
Bi–S plane on the superconducting properties of La1-xMx(O,F)BiS2 (where M = Mg and Ca). 
They find that a distortion in Bi–S plane is necessary to enhance superconductivity in LnOBiS2. 
This seems to be true as on decreasing the size of rare earth ion, thereby increasing the distortion 
in Bi–S plane, Tc is found to increase (from Tc = 2.5 K in La to 5 K in Nd) in LnO1-xFxBiS2. 
Similar enhancement in Tc is also observed when two different rare earth ions are partially 
substituted for example in Ce1-xNdx(O,F)BiS2 and Nd1-xSmx(O,F)BiS2. Tc increases with increase 
in substitution of smaller ion upto a certain value.20-21 
Magnetization measurements in an applied field of 30 Oe carried out on a collection of large 
number of tiny single crystals (size ~ 100μm) of composition x = 0.0 and 0.5 exhibit a 
paramagnetic behavior down to 2 K (Fig. 3). These measurements clearly indicate absence of 
superconductivity at T > 2 K. The small hump at around 50 K is seen due to freezing of oxygen 
which might be present in the sample holder or due to slightly poor vacuum in the sample 
chamber. For the purpose of clarity, results of the variable temperature susceptibility (and its 
inverse) of the polycrystalline sample with x = 0.5 are shown in the low temperature range (T < 


7 
 
100 K) in figure 4. Curie constant ‘C’ obtained from the Curie-Weiss fit to the χ-1 vs T plot is C 
= 0.47 emu*K*mol-1 and θp is –3.6 K. The Sm paramagnetic moment (as there is no other 
moment carrying species in the material) calculated using this value of C is 0.61 μB. The 
deviation from the magnetic moment expected for free Sm3+ ion (0.84 μB) is possibly due to the 
crystal field effects. This magnetic moment is consistent with +3 ionic state of samarium. Field 
dependence of the magnetization is linear down to 5 K as shown in inset of Fig. 3, suggesting no 
magnetic ordering down to 5 K. 
Resistivity measured for x = 0.5 on a sintered polycrystalline pellet show a semiconductor like 
behavior similar to the undoped compound (x = 0) (fig. 5). The resistivity value though 
decreased upon fluorine doping. We have not seen superconductivity down to 2 K in 
SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 (see discussion in the next section). It may be pointed out that other members of 
this series are known to be superconducting (La, Ce, Nd, Pr and Yb) with Tc ~ 2.5 K – 5 K.15 
La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 
Compositions corresponding to La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 were synthesized to investigate the 
possibility of superconductivity by doping La in non-superconducting SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 and also 
study the effect of chemical pressure on Tc.. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns of La1-
ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 are presented in figure 6. Majority of the peaks correspond to the parent 
LaOBiS2 phase along with some peaks for impurity phases like Bi2S3, Bi2O3, BiF3 and/or LaF3. 
Rietveld refinement on all the compositions was performed to study the crystal structure. The 
occupancies of La and Sm were refined constraining their sum to be unity. The occupancies of O 
and F were fixed to the nominal value. Results of Rietveld refinement and important structural 
parameters are provided in the Supporting Information. The variation of a and c lattice parameter 


8 
 
with Sm doping (y) is presented in figure 7. There is a gradual decrease in the a-lattice parameter 
as we infer from the shift of the (200) peak towards higher angle (see figure S5 in supporting 
information). This is expected as Sm has a smaller ionic radius than that of La. The (004) peak 
does not show a gradual trend as a function of Sm-content (see figure S5 in supporting 
information).  The inferred c-lattice parameter also, thus, does not show a gradual (smooth) 
variation as a function of Sm–content. This type of structural anisotropy is common in layered 
structures like Ln(O,F)BiS2.20-21  In contrast to the observation of Kajitani et al,21 we do not find 
a solubility limit of Sm ions at La sites and hence, La was completely replaced by Sm and the 
sample with y = 1.0 i.e. SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 could be obtained. 
Superconductivity is observed in all the samples La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8). 
Figure 8a shows the diamagnetic response in all these materials. Tc shows an enhancement with 
increase in value of y. Maximum Tc of 4.4 K is observed for y = 0.8. This enhancement in Tc can 
be attributed to unit cell contraction and local structure distortion as studied by Chen et al.29 
Resistivity measurements, figure 8b, reconfirm the superconducting behavior in these materials. 
We should point out that in all the resistivity plots, a ‘semiconductor’–like increase in resistivity 
is observed just before the beginning of the superconducting drop (Inset of Fig. 8b).  This is 
commonly observed in high-Tc cuprates and in F-doped LnOBiS2 materials. In the upper panel of 
figure 9, we show the value of Tc in these materials as measured magnetically and by resistivity. 
As already discussed above the pure Sm sample (y = 1) is non-superconducting till 2K (the limit 
of our measurement) which means that there may be a critical Sm concentration (0.8 < y < 1) 
which gives a maximum Tc and further addition of Sm would suppress the superconducting state. 
Similar type of study has been very recently reported by Kajitani et al,21 where Sm has been 


9 
 
substituted for Nd in NdO0.5F0.5OBiS2 and a maximum Tc is achieved with Sm = 0.6, beyond 
which the Tc suddenly diminishes. Kajitani et al,21 also mentioned that there is a solubility limit 
for Sm in Nd1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.8) but in our study La and Sm were completely soluble.  
Structure-property relationship 
Band structure calculations have revealed that the DOS near the Fermi level for these Bi-S 
superconductors is mainly due to Bi–6p states with only a small contribution from S–3p states.33-
34 The in-plane Bi–6p orbitals are mainly involved in the overlap with S–3p orbitals and thus, the 
in-plane (ab–plane) Bi–S bond lengths and the S–Bi–S bond angle seems to be important in 
inducing and enhancing superconductivity. Therefore the local structure in the Bi–S layers is an 
important parameter for superconductivity in LnOBiS2 vis-à-vis FeAs layers in LnOFeAs 
superconductors. In order to get an insight, the effect of Sm substitution on local structure of Bi–
S layers was investigated. The in-plane Bi–Seq distances and the in-plane S–Bi–S bond angle 
were calculated from structural data obtained after Rietveld analysis. The in–plane Bi–S bond 
lengths largely depend on the a-lattice parameter. In case of Sm doping at La sites the a–lattice 
parameter decrease gradually which leads to a decrease in the Bi–S distances as evident in lower 
panel of figure 9. Due to the decrease in the Bi–S distance a better overlap is expected which 
seems to enhance Tc. This trend is followed by all the Sm doped compositions. The in plane S–
Bi–S angle is also expected to play a significant role in superconductivity. The flatter the bond 
(~180o) the better would be the overlap between the Bi–6p and S–3p orbitals. But as observed by 
Chen, et al,29 a little distortion in the Bi–S layer could enhance Tc. A similar trend seems to 
follow in La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2. In case of y = 1.0 i.e. SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 composition the Bi–S bond 
length is slightly larger than other Sm–doped compositions which seems to overshadow the 


10 
 
favorable effect of distortion in S–Bi–S bond angle. This may possibly be the reason for absence 
of superconductivity in SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 but it needs to be further investigated.  
Conclusions 
We have successfully synthesized SmO1-xFxBiS2 which is a new member of the F–doped 
LnOBiS2 family. This material is non superconducting and paramagnetic down to 2 K. We have 
investigated the structure and properties of the Sm substituted materials La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y 
= 0.0 – 1.0) with Sm3+ ions smaller in size as compared with La3+-ions and thus simulating 
chemical pressure as one effect of the substitution. Structural distortion in the Bi–S plane was 
analyzed. We find that the Bi–S bond lengths decrease with the increase in the doping level of 
the smaller Sm ion at the La site. We have observed superconductivity in La1-y SmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 
(y = 0.0 – 0.8) and we find that Tc is gradually enhanced upon doping Sm at the La site as y→ 
0.8. Absence of superconductivity in SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is anomalous and deserves to be 
investigated. We also think that a tuning between these parameters via suitable doping or applied 
pressure could lead to superconductivity in SmO1-xFxBiS2.

Figure S2. Electron micrograph of a typical SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 crystal with dimension (220 μm x 120 
μm x 20 μm).  
Many crystals of different sizes with one of the 
longest dimension ranging from 20 – 300 μm 
were obtained. The crystals were not big enough 
to be fit for Resistivity and magnetization 
measurements and hence for resistivity a sintered 
pellet of polycrystalline sample was used. For 
magnetization measurements a mixture of many 
tiny crystals of different sizes was used.

Presence of all the constituent elements is evident from the EDAX graph. The table denotes the 
percentage composition of each element in the sample. EDAX data was collected on many such crystals 
and the final stoichiometry was deduced by averaging the data obtained from each point. The average 
approximate stoichiometry was calculated to be SmBi0.96S2.1F0.39.

 Figure S5. Magnified X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 in the region around 
(004) and (200) peaks. 
The regular shift of (200) peaks towards higher angle with increase in Sm doping indicates a-axis 
contraction. The (004) peaks do not show such regularity which indicates that the change in c-axis is not 
linear to the change in the Sm contraction.
