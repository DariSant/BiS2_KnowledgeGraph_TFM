The superconducting properties and structural parameters, 
including the Grüneisen parameter (γG), of the BiCh2-based (Ch: S, 
Se) layered superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex were investigated. 
The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) increased with 
increasing Se concentration (x), and bulk superconductivity was 
induced by Se substitution. γG exhibited a larger value when x ≥ 0.4, 
where the superconducting properties were improved. These results 
suggest that the increase of lattice anharmonicity is preferable for 
superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. The discussion includes 
data for related superconductors REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd), where 
a positive correlation between γG and Tc is revealed for Se-poor 
samples. In addition, specific heat analyses suggest the presence of a 
low-energy optical phonon mode for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
 
 
 
1. Introduction 
Following the discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 in 2012, 
BiCh2-based (Ch = S, Se) layered superconductors have since been developed [1–10]. Despite 
the highest recorded transition temperature (Tc) in the BiCh2-based family being as high as 11 
K, exotic superconducting properties still attract researchers in the field of superconductivity 
science. An example is the suppression of local in-plane structural disorder in the induction of 
bulk superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 (RE: rare earth) [11–15]. The suppression of local 
disorder is achieved by in-plane chemical pressure (CP) effects, which can be applied by 


 
isovalent substitution at RE and/or Ch sites. In addition, in Bi4O4S3 [16,17], La(O,F)BiSSe [18–
21], and Nd(O,F)BiS2 [22,23], unconventional features of superconducting states have been 
experimentally revealed [24]. Further, theoretical studies suggest that unconventional pairings 
in BiCh2-based systems are feasible [25–27]. Therefore, the mechanisms of superconductivity 
in BiCh2-based systems should be elucidated. 
Recently, we studied the relationship between the lattice anharmonicity in RE(O,F)BiS2 
(RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) by estimating the Grüneisen parameter (γG) [28], which was motivated 
by the study of γG in a related system LaOBiS2-xSex [29], which is a thermoelectric system that 
exhibits an anharmonic atomic vibration [30–32]. In RE(O,F)BiS2, a positive correlation 
between superconductivity (Tc) and γG was observed [28], implying that the increase in 
anharmonicity correlates with the emergence of superconductivity in BiCh2-based systems. 
This trend is similar to that observed in caged compounds with rattling modes [33,34]. 
Therefore, additional investigation of the relationship between superconductivity and 
anharmonicity in BiCh2-based compounds is required to understand the superconductivity 
mechanisms in the superconductor family. In this work, we investigated the superconducting 
properties and lattice anharmonicity of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, in which Se substitution at the in-
plane Ch1 site induces in-plane CP and bulk superconductivity [11,14]. The results on γG 
suggest that bulk superconductivity is induced when anharmonicity is enhanced. However, the 
estimated γG was relatively constant at x = 0.4–1.0, which could be the cause of Tc being lower 
in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex than in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 with a larger γG. In addition, we found that γG for 
Se-rich samples deviates from the positive correlation in γG-Tc, which implies that the effects 
of in-plane chemical pressure through Se substitution are different from those of Nd substitution 
at the blocking layers. The presence of optical phonons with an energy of 6–7 meV that 
correspond to the Bi rattling modes [32] were detected from specific heat (C) analyses in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
 
2. Experimental Details 
2.1 Synthesis and Measurements 
Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) were 
synthesized via a solid-state reaction [35]. The obtained samples were densified using a high-
pressure synthesis method with a 180-ton cubic-anvil system at a pressure of ~1.5 GPa and an 
annealing temperature of ~300 °C for 15 min, which allowed us to examine the sound velocity 
using dense samples with a relative density higher than 95%. For x = 0, we analyzed low-
temperature specific heat using a polycrystalline sample, and the γG was estimated using the 


 
parameters published in Ref. [28]. To investigate the temperature dependence of the lattice 
constants, synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiments were performed at beamline 
BL02B2 and SPring-8 at a wavelength of 0.496571(1) Å under proposal No. 2022A1698. The 
SXRD experiments were performed with a sample rotator system at room temperature, and the 
diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector, 
multiple MYTHEN system [36], with a step size of 2θ = 0.006°. The samples were packed in 
an evacuated capillary glass tube with an inner diameter of 0.2 mm, and the temperature of the 
sample was controlled using N2 gas. From the obtained SXRD patterns, lattice constants a and 
c were determined by the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP [37]. We determined the Se 
occupancy at the in-plane (Ch1) and out-of-plane (Ch2) sites and confirmed that Se selectively 
occupied the in-plane Ch1 site, as shown in Fig. 1 [38]. The refined Se concentrations are listed 
in Table I. A schematic of the crystal structure (Fig. 1) was obtained using VESTA [39]. 
Magnetic susceptibility (χ) was measured using a superconducting interference device 
(SQUID) magnetometer on a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS3, Quantum 
Design) with an applied field of 10 Oe after zero-field cooling and field cooling (ZFC and FC). 
Specific heat was measured via a relaxation method using a physical property measurement 
system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The longitudinal sound velocity (vL) of the sample was 
measured using an ultrasonic thickness detector (Satotech-2000C). The actual composition was 
investigated by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) using a scanning electron 
microscope (TM-3030, Hitachi-High Tech) equipped with an EDX analyzer SwiftED (Oxford). 
 
2.2 Grüneisen Parameter 
The γG values of the samples were calculated using the following formula, as described in 
our previous studies [28,29]:  
𝛾G =

𝐶V
       (1) 
where βV, B, Vmol, and CV are the volume thermal-expansion coefficient, bulk modulus, molar 
volume, and specific heat, respectively. The parameters needed for the estimation of γG were 
calculated using equations (2–5, where dV/dT, ρ, vL, vS, vm, θD, h, kB, n, NA, and M denote the 
temperature gradient of the lattice volume, density of the material, longitudinal sound velocity, 
shear sound velocity, average sound velocity, Debye temperature, Plank’s constant, 
Boltzmann’s constant, number of atoms in the molecule (formula unit), Avogadro’s constant, 
and molecular weight (per formula unit), respectively.

3. Results 
3-1. Superconducting Properties 
The superconducting properties of the obtained samples were investigated using magnetic 
susceptibility (χ) and specific heat (C). Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of 4πχ 
for x = 0.2–1.0. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependence of 4πχ for x = 0, where 
filamentary signals of superconductivity was observed. At x = 0.2, the shielding volume fraction 
examined by ZFC data at 1.8 K was less than -1, but it increased with increasing x. Here, the 
shielding volume fraction exceeded -1 owing to the demagnetization effect for samples with 
bulk superconductivity, which has been commonly observed in BiCh2-based polycrystalline 
samples [10]. The trend of Se substitution inducing bulk superconductivity is consistent with 
the results of a previous study [35]. The Tc values estimated from the temperature at which χ 
begins to decrease are plotted in Fig. 5(a). Figs. 2(c–h) show the temperature dependences of 
Cel/T, where Cel is the electronic specific heat estimated by subtracting the phonon contribution 
of C. We assumed that the low-temperature C is described as C = γT + βT3 + δT5 [40,41]. Tc in 
the specific heat measurements was estimated from the analysis of the jump of Cel at Tc (ΔCel), 
where the entropy balance was considered in the analyses, as shown in Figs. 2(c–h). The trend 
of the Se concentration dependence of Tc in the specific heat data is similar to that in the 
susceptibility data. The ΔCel/γTc value for x = 0 is the smallest, which is consistent with the 
susceptibility result. The ΔCel/γTc values were comparable at x = 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6, and increased 
at x = 0.8 and 1.0. The results suggest that the bulk nature of superconductivity is enhanced by 
Se substitution because the estimated value at x = 1.0 is close to that expected from the BCS 
model [42]. In addition, the estimated in-plane CP is plotted in Fig. 5(b), which indicates that 
Se substitution in the examined samples results in an increase in in-plane CP [11]. See Ref [11] 
for details on the calculation of in-plane CP in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. 
 


 
3-2. Structural Properties 
The crystal structure parameters were investigated using Rietveld refinements, where the 
SXRD pattern and the refinement result at x = 0.8 (T = 301 K) are displayed in Fig. 3. See the 
Supplemental Materials [43] for the other compositions. LaF3 impurities were included in all 
refinements; however, the population of the phase was minor (1–2%). The estimated 
compositions (Se concentration x) were close to nominal x and those determined by EDX, as 
listed in Table I. The temperature dependence of the estimated lattice constants (a and c) and 
the cell volume (V) are plotted in Figs. 4(a–c) at x = 0.8 and in Supplemental Materials [43] for 
other compositions. The temperature differential of V was estimated by linear fitting of the V–
T data, and βV was calculated using equation (2). The vL was estimated as 3110(10), 3260(10), 
3290(10), 3290(10), and 3290(10) m/s at x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively. An example 
of fitting the specific heat data above Tc is shown in Fig. 4(d). The estimated θD is 220(1), 
215(1), 221(1), 218(1), 221(1) K at x = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0, respectively. Here, we 
analyzed low-temperature specific heat data at 3–9 K for x = 0 by refining fitting and obtained 
228(1) K (See Fig. S6 in Supplemental Materials [43] for the analysis for x = 0). Therefore, the 
B and γG are modified from the published data in Ref. [28]. Using equations (1–5), we calculated 
B and γG and plotted them in Figs. 5(c and d). B increased with increasing in-plane CP in 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd). In LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [28], B increases with a small 
amount of Se and became the highest at x = 0.4. Subsequently, B decreased with increasing x at 
x ≥ 0.4. Because the in-plane CP, shown in Fig. 5(b), increases with increasing x, the structural 
characteristics of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex differ. The γG values for x = 0 and 0.2 
are smaller than those for x ≥ 0.4. However, it becomes relatively constant at x ≥ 0.4. Therefore, 
bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex emerges when the anharmonicity is enhanced as 
seen with x ≥ 0.4, which implies positive correlation between γG and superconductivity. For x 
= 0 and 0.2, the trend looks inconsistent with the scenario, but we consider that the data point 
at x = 0 was slightly increased due to the presence of local structural disorder, where local-scale 
symmetry lowering is present [44]. See Fig. S7 in Supplemental Materials [43] for the estimated 
isotropic displacement parameter Uiso for the Ch1 site, which clearly shows that Uiso at x = 0 is 
large due to the local disorder. When focusing on Tc, however, the results did not reveal a clear 
positive correlation between Tc and γG in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. In the following discussion, we 
discuss the relationship between superconductivity and lattice anharmonicity in 
REO0.5F0.5BiCh2. 
 
 


 
4. Discussion 
4-1. Correlation between superconductivity and anharmonicity 
 According to BCS theory, a high phonon energy is preferred for a higher Tc, as revealed in 
MgB2 [45] and hydride superconductors [46–48]. The target system of this study is BiCh2-based 
compounds, in which the Bi p electrons contribute to electronic conduction and, hence, 
superconducting pairing. Because of the heavy Bi atoms, a high phonon energy cannot be 
expected in BiCh2-based compounds, and a theoretical study suggested that several-K Tc in 
tetragonal RE(O,F)BiS2 cannot be understood using conventional phonon-mediated models 
[25]. In addition, the absence of isotope effects on the S or Se sites has been confirmed in 
tetragonal Bi4O4S3 and La(O,F)BiSSe [16,18]. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms of 
superconductivity in tetragonal BiCh2-based compounds are different from conventional 
phonon-mediated weak-coupling superconductivity. Here, we discuss the relationship between 
the anharmonic atomic vibrations and superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds. In caged 
compounds, the increase in anharmonicity in the rattling mode (low-energy optical-phonon 
mode) results in the enhancement of strong-coupling superconductivity and an increase in Tc 
[33,49]. If the pairing in BiCh2-based systems is mediated by the rattling of Bi, the absence of 
the isotope effect for the S or Se sites can be explained. 
 In Fig. 6, Tcs of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd) are plotted as functions 
of γG. As mentioned above, no clear correlation between Tc and γG was observed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, which could be due to the constant γG at x = 0.4–1.0. However, we find that 
Tc increases with increasing γG for Se-free and Se-poor samples, as highlighted by the green 
curve in Fig. 6, after the addition of the data points of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Here, we excluded x = 0 
because the susceptibility does not show bulk superconductivity signals. What is the origin of 
the large γG, which suggests large anharmonicity in the system? We consider that the one-
dimensional rattling-like vibrations of Bi atoms along the c-axis contribute to their 
anharmonicity. Indeed, the softening of these rattling modes was detected using γG in 
thermoelectric LaOBi(S,Se)2 [29,32]. Therefore, the increase in γG in superconducting 
REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 with Se-poor compositions is possibly linked to softening of the low-energy 
phonon mode of Bi in the BiCh2 layers. In the current work, we cannot clarify the cause of the 
deviation in the data points for the Se-rich samples in Fig. 6, but it would be related to the 
changes in superconducting states (and/or the influence of anharmonicity on superconductivity) 
because Se substitution at the Ch1 site largely modifies the chemical bonding and electronic 
states [10,15]. In addition, we discuss possible changes in characteristics of anharmonic 
vibration by Se substitution. 


 
 
4-2. Low-energy phonons 
 Because the discussion above assumes an anharmonic rattling-like vibration in 
superconducting REO0.5F0.5BiCh2, we examined the presence of low-energy optical phonons in 
these samples using the specific heat. We performed low-temperature specific heat 
measurements for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and LaOBiS2-ySey (thermoelectric phase). In materials 
with low-energy optical phonons, a peak is expected in the plot at a temperature corresponding 
to approximately a fifth of the phonon energy [50,51]. Because the phonon energy observed in 
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is 6–7 meV for LaOBiS2-ySey [32], we expected a peak at 
approximately 12–14 K. As shown in Fig. S8(a) (Supplemental Materials [43]), the specific 
heat analysis results for LaOBiS2-ySey confirmed the evolution of a peak structure and the 
softening of the optical phonon [decrease in peak temperature (Tp)] by Se substitution, which 
is consistent with the INS results [32]. The analysis results for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are 
summarized in Fig. 7(a), where (C-γT)/T3 is plotted as functions of temperature. Similar peaks 
were observed at 12.4–13.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. The peak temperatures were determined 
by taking the temperature differential of the polynomial-fitting results. The peaks are evidence 
of low-energy phonon modes in superconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. In addition, the peak 
temperatures for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are clearly lower than Tp = 14.0 K for LaOBiS2 (y = 0) [see 
Fig. S8(b)], implying the enhanced anharmonicity by F substitution. Based on the difference in 
γG, we expected a lower Tp at x = 0.8 than that at x = 0.2, but the obtained results did not 
corroborate this expectation. Although we have no explanation for this trend, one possible cause 
is the difference in local structural disorder in samples with lower in-plane CP (e.g., at x = 0 
and 0.2). The change in local structure may affect Tp. Furthermore, from Fig. 7(b), we find that 
the optical phonon energy decreases with Se substitution for x ≤ 0.4, but it increases for further 
Se substitution for x = 0.6–1.0. However, we noticed that the contributions of optical phonon 
in (C-γT)/T3 is large at x = 0.8 and 1.0. The large (C-γT)/T3 values than β (see Table I) is linked 
to the enhanced anharmonicity as revealed in Ref. 51. Therefore, the weak hardening at x = 0.6–
1.0 would be related to the changes in the shape of the interatomic potential and/or optical 
phonon characteristics. The results on γG and (C-γT)/T3 would be suggesting the importance of 
anharmonicity on superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. To further understand the 
correlation between superconductivity and anharmonicity (rattling-like Bi vibration) in BiCh2-
based superconductors, further studies using various probes, including INS, are required.  
 
 


 
5. Conclusion 
 Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex were synthesized. Using magnetic 
susceptibility and specific heat measurements, the superconducting properties of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex were examined, and the Tc phase diagram obtained. To investigate the lattice 
anharmonicity, the Grüneisen parameter (γG) was calculated using the sample density; sound 
velocity; Debye temperature; and crystal structure parameters, including the volume thermal 
expansion coefficient and specific heat. A larger γG value was observed at x ≥ 0.4, at which Tc 
was higher than that at x = 0.2, and bulk superconductivity was observed. In addition, the 
discussion including REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd) showed that Tc increased with increasing γG 
for samples with Se-free and Se-poor compositions. The trend suggests positive correlation 
between anharmonicity and superconductivity in the Se-poor samples. However, the data for 
the Se-rich samples deviate from the γG-Tc correlation. These results imply that superconducting 
states and/or the influence of anharmonicity on superconductivity are different between the Se-
poor and Se-rich phases of REO0.5F0.5BiCh2. To reveal the origin of the anharmonicity, we 
measured the specific heat and observed a peak in (C-γT)/T3 at 12.4–13.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-
xSex. Those results suggest the importance of anharmonic vibration on superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex.

in this system (Fig. S7).
