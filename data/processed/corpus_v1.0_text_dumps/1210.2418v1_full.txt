Very recently a new family of layered materials, containing BiS2 planes was discovered to be
superconducting at temperatures up to Tc=10 K, raising questions about the mechanism of su-
perconductivity in these systems. Here, we present state-of-the-art ﬁrst principles calculations that
directly address this question and reveal several surprising ﬁndings. The parent compound LaOBiS2
possesses anharmonic ferroelectric soft phonons at the zone center with a rather large polarization
of ≈10µC/cm2, which is comparable to the well-known ferroelectric BiFeO3. Upon electron doping,
new unstable phonon branches appear along the entire line Q = (q, q, 0), causing Bi/S atoms to order
in a one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW). We ﬁnd that BiS2 is a strong electron-phonon
coupled superconductor in the vicinity of competing ferroelectric and CDW phases. Our results
suggest new directions to tune the balance between these phases and increase Tc in this new class
of materials.

Superconductivity – a phenomenon ﬁrst documented
in 1911 – remains one of the most challenging subjects
of condensed matter physics. Examples of layered super-
conductors include cuprates[1], MgB2[2], CaC6[3], and
recent iron-pnictides[4]. Very recently a new family of
layered materials, Bi4O4S3[5] and ROxF1−xBiS2 (R=La,
Nd, Pr, and Ce)[6–9], containing BiS2 planes was discov-
ered to be superconducting at temperatures up to 10 K.
These new systems are structurally similar to the lay-
ered, iron-based superconductors LaOxF1−xFeAs[4], and
in both cases the superconductivity is achieved by F-
doping. In addition, band structure calculations[11, 12]
indicate the presence of strong Fermi surface nesting at
the wave vector (π, π), which is the hallmark property
of the Fe-pnictides[4]. These similarities have raised the
exciting question of whether or not the superconduct-
ing mechanism in the BiS2 system is related to that in
the iron pnictides and have therefore generated enormous
interest[5–18].
The fundamental question is whether or not the ob-
served Tc in this new system can be understood within a
conventional electron-phonon coupling framework, or is a
more exotic mechanism responsible for the superconduct-
ing pairing? In this work, we present state-of-the-art ﬁrst
principles calculations that directly address this question
and reveal several surprising ﬁndings. We show that the
parent compound LaOBiS2 possesses highly anharmonic,
ferroelectric, soft phonons at the zone center and a spon-
taneous polarization of ∼10µC/cm2 that is comparable
to that in the well-known multiferroic BiFeO3.
Upon
electron doping new instabilities appear along the entire
line Q = (q, q, 0), which causes the Bi/S atoms to order
into a one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW). We
ﬁnd that BiS2 is a strong electron-phonon coupled su-
perconductor in close proximity to competing ferroelec-

tric and CDW phases. Our results suggest new directions
with which to tune the balance between these phases and
increase Tc in this new class of materials.
Figure 1 shows the P4/nmm tetragonal cell of the
LaOxF1−xBiS2 which consists of two types of atomic lay-
ers; namely the LaO spacer and electronically active BiS2
bilayer. Upon F-doping in the LaO layer, one can con-
trol the charge transfer to BiS2 bilayer and thus tune
the electronic properties. In order to simulate such dop-
ing in our calculations, we generated 2 × 2 × 1 super-
cell of LaOBiS2 and replaced some of the oxygen atoms
with F atoms in an ordered fashion with doping levels of
x = 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, and 0.5. The results are sum-

marized in Fig. 2.
The undoped parent compound is a band-insulator
with a gap of ≈0.8 eV. Upon electron doping, we start to
ﬁll the empty states in a rigid-band fashion, turning the
insulating parent compound into a metallic system. From
the projected density of states (DOS), we determine that
the states near the Fermi level are mainly Bi−6p and
S−3p character. The density of states at the Fermi level,
N(EF ), increases with increasing electron doping and be-
comes maximal at the half ﬁling x=0.5. In agreement
with experiments, the c-axis length decreases while the
a- and b-axis lengths increase with F-doping. Interest-
ingly the z-values of the in-plane S (i.e., Sin) and Bi
atoms get closer to each other with doping, yielding a
nearly perfect planer structure at x=0.5. On the other
hand zigzag buckled planes are formed at x=0, as shown
in Fig. 1. This rearrangement of Bi and S atoms into
a perfect planer structure should have important conse-
quences for the electronic band structure and the nature
of Fermi surface. Hence it is important to keep an eye on
the degree of buckling of BiS2 plane and its relation to
Tc as new isostructural materials are being discovered.
We note that similar buckling of CuO2 plane in cuprates
with doping were found to be closely correlated with su-
perconducting temperature[19].
One of the most interesting results shown in Fig. 2
is that N(EF ) is quite high at half-ﬁlling (x=0.5) and
EF coincides with a peak in the density of states. This
usually suggests some sort of instability due to a Van

Hove singularity. In order to check this, we calculated
phonon dispersion curves of the parent (x=0) and half
doped (x=0.5) systems using 4 × 4 × 1 supercell and the
results are shown in Figure 3. To our surprise, we ﬁnd
that the undoped system shows instability near Γ while
the doped system has instabilities along the entire line of
Q=(q,q,0) (see also Fig. S2). We repeated the phonon
dispersion calculations for x=0.5 using a charged system
without F-doping and obtained the same instabilities (see
Fig. S1), indicating that the soft phonons found here are
an intrinsic property of the BiS2 plane.
In order to have a better insight into the nature of
these unstable phonons, we carried out total energy cal-
culations as the system was distorted by the modes hav-
ing the most negative energy. Figure 4a shows the most
unstable soft phonon Eu at Γ for x=0, which lowers the
symmetry from P4/nmm to P21mn (see Fig. S3). The
S atoms move towards Bi atoms along a-axis (or b-axis)
and slightly lower the energy of the system by ≈1 meV.
When the lattice parameters are relaxed, the tetragonal
cell becomes orthorhombic and the system energy is fur-
ther lowered by 0.3 meV. The ﬁnal structure is shown in
Fig. S3. It is remarkable that in the distorted phase, the
inversion symmetry is broken and a large spontaneous
polarization of P = 9.9µC/cm2 is induced despite the
rather small displacements. The calculated polarization
is comparable to that of the well-known room tempera-
ture ferroelectric BiFeO3 system[20]. However, we note
that the potential curve for this unstable ferroelectric
phonon mode is quite shallow, as shown in Figure 4, and
quantum zero-point motions may not allow such struc-
tural distortion.
In fact, solving the Schrdinger equa-
tion for this potential, we obtained energy levels which

are above the potential minimum.
Hence, the system
should be dynamically disordered due to zero-point mo-
tions and should appear as tetragonal. These ﬁndings
seem to be consistent with the room temperature x-ray
data reported so far. Finally, we suggest that the ori-
gin of the anharmonic ferroelectric mode could be due
to mismatch between the optimum lattice parameters of
the LaO and the BiS2 layers. If the Bi-S bond is forced
to elongate due to interaction between LaO and BiS2
planes, then it is natural for the S atom to break the sym-
metry and move towards the Bi atom to optimize Bi-S
interaction. In fact, repeating the phonon calculations for
smaller lattice parameters (i.e. a=b=3.8 , corresponding
to 100 kbar pressure), we do not get negative phonon en-
ergies at the zone center any more. Hence, it seems that
by changing the spacer oxide, one may tune the nature
of the soft phonons and the ground state structure.

the parent compound, the distortion lowers the system
energy signiﬁcantly, causing S atoms move away by 0.16
˚A from the high symmetry site. Solving the Schrodinger
equation for the resulting potential curve numerically,
we obtained the energy levels which are bound to the

in Fig.

for the charged system without F-doping.
Hence, the

correspond to the original instability at the (π/2, π/2) of
the 4 × 4 × 1 tetragonal supercell calculations. Hence,
we further distorted the 2

(π/2, π/2) negative energy phonon and let the system re-
lax. We determined that the optimized structure has the
√

2 unit cell with a rather interesting rearrange-
ment of Bi and S atoms in the BiS2 plane, as shown in
Fig. 5 and Fig. S4. We call this distorted structure as
CDW phase, due to the sinusoidal distortion of the Bi
and S atoms as shown by red dashed lines in Figure 5.
Unlike the x = 0 case, applying pressure or using smaller
lattice constants in the phonon calculations does not sta-
bilize the negative energy phonons. Hence, it is tempting
to conclude that the origin of this distortion is due to
strong Fermi surface nesting at M[11, 12]. However, we
note that the soft phonon branch occurs along the entire
line Q = (q, q, 0) and not just at the M point. Hence,
in addition to Fermi surface nesting, there should be an
important structural reason as well for the observed soft


4
modes. Finally, by looking at the bond distances between
Bi-S, we notice that there are one-dimensional channels
of Bi-S bonding as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, from
Hall Eﬀect measurements14 it was concluded that super-
conducting pairing occurs in one-dimensional chains in
these systems, which could be related to the CDW phase
predicted here.
Similarly, high pressure measurements
reveal non-monotonic dependence of Tc on pressure and
suggest that the Fermi surface of LaOxF1−xBiS2 could
be in the vicinity of instabilities[10]. Finally, the x-ray
powder diﬀraction[6] for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows rather
unusual broad peaks, which could be again related to
the CDW phase.
We next address the nature of superconductivity found
in these BiS2 layered systems. We carried out el-ph cou-
pling calculations using both (π, π) phonon optimized

√
2 and CDW structures. We consider 2
√

supercells, containing 80 atoms and obtain the el-ph cou-
pling by the frozen-phonon method. The results are sum-
marized in Figure 6. In both (π, π)-optimized or fully
distorted CDW structures, the Eliashberg functions are
quite similar, indicating that the main physics of the
electron-phonon coupling mechanism does not depend on
the details of the structure. In the (π, π)-phonon opti-
mized structure, N(EF ) is higher than in the CDW phase,
and therefore leads to higher el-ph coupling. The total
electron-phonon coupling is λ = 0.83 with a logarith-
mic frequency average ωlog = 101K. These values give
a maximum superconducting temperature of Tc = 8.5
K. Even in the fully distorted CDW phase, we get quite
large electron-phonon coupling λ = 0.6 and a logarithmic
frequency average ωlog = 122 K, which gives a Tc of 6
K. These values are in excellent agreement with the re-
ported experimental values of Tc which vary from 3K to
10 K, depending on the level of doping and sample qual-
ity. Inspecting the modes which give the highest el-ph
coupling, we estimate that about 90% of λ comes from
in-plane Bi and S phonons while the remaining 10% is
due to phonons along the c-axis. There are two bands
of phonons near (5 to 10) meV and (15 to 25) meV. The
phonons in the lower energy band are due to coupled Bi
and S motion while the phonons in the high energy bands
are due to almost pure S oscillations. Animation of these
modes can be found in Ref.24. In Figure 6, we also show
the total phonon density of states along with the atomic-
projections of the DOS. As expected based on the masses
of atoms, O and F-based phonons are above 30 meV and
do not producing much el-ph coupling. The La phonons
are near 10 meV but, as expected, do not produce any
signiﬁcant el-ph coupling.
In conclusion, we have discovered rather unusual struc-
tural and dynamical properties of LaOBiS2 with electron
doping. The large-amplitude in-plane S-atom displace-
ment controls the structural properties and gives rise to
large el-ph coupling. It would be interesting to measure
the isotope eﬀect for the S atom, which may be uncon-

ventional. Our results also suggest that thin ﬁlms of BiS2
on various substrates may exhibit unusual properties due
to epitaxial strain at the interface. New materials with
similar structures but with BiO2 plane could be quite
interesting due to smaller mass of oxygen atom, which
gives higher phonon energies, and in turn higher Tc. In
fact, the results reported here remind us of another inter-
esting system, namely Ba1−xKxBiO3[25], which exhibits
several complicated structural phases[26] and supercon-
ductivity at 31 K[25]. It is too early to say which of these
predictions from DFT calculations will be demonstrated
experimentally. However it is clear that the BiS2 based
layered systems are very rich in physics, involving nearly
ferroelectric soft phonons and CDW ordering along with
strongly coupled electron-phonon superconductivity.

Methods The ﬁrst-principles calculations were
performed within the plane-wave implementation of the
Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized gradient approxi-
mation to density functional theory as implemented in
the PWSCF package[21]. We used Vanderbilt-type ultra-
soft potentials. The wavefunction and charge cutoﬀs are
taken as 40 Ry and 480 Ry, respectively. We tested that
k-sampling converges well with a k-point grid of 20x20x6
in the tetragonal cell. For

k-mesh of 14x14x6. The structures are optimized until
the forces on atoms are less than 0.005 eV/˚A
and the
stress is less than 0.01 kbar. Some of the total energy
and phonon calculations were also repeated by Vienna
Ab-Initio Simulation Package using more accurate Pro-
jector Augmented Waves method[22]. We obtained very
similar results concerning the structural distortion, soft
phonons and their energies. Finally, the electric polariza-
tion is calculated by PWSCF via the modern theory of
polarization (i.e. Berry Phase). We used 20x20x6 k-mesh
for self-consistent calculations and the polarization is cal-
culated using twice dense k-grid along the calculated po-
larization direction. The phonon dispersion curves were
obtained by the direct ﬁnite displacement method. We
used 0.02 ˚A displacements in plus and minus directions
to obtain the force-constant matrix numerically. Once we

is calculated by the supercell frozen-phonon method[23].
Brieﬂy, for a given phonon branch, the system is dis-
torted according to the normal mode by its root-mean-
square (rms) value and then the electron-phonon matrix
element, Mn,n′ =< n|Hp −H0|n′ > , is calculated self-
consistently using the wave-functions (|n >) and eigen-
values (En) of the total potential Hp, H0 (i.e., frozen-
phonon and reference cell, respectively). The el-ph cou-
pling constant λ is then obtained from the Fermi surface
averaging of Mn,n′ using gaussian smearing method. The
superconducting critical temperature Tc, was estimated
using the Allen-Dynes formula, with µ∗= 0 for the upper
limit of Tc.
2. Phonon Dispersion Curves in the Electron-
Doped System without F-substitution
Here we compare the phonon dispersion curves ob-
tained from 4×4×1 supercell of the tetragonal LaOBiS2
cell with x = 0.5 doping level (top panel in Fig. S1)
with the one obtained from actual F-substituted sys-
tem (bottom panel in Fig.S1). Note that both systems
show the same phonon instability along the entire line
Q = (q, q, 0). Hence the predicted soft modes do not de-
pend on the details of the doping and it is intrinsic to the
BiS2 plane. The main diﬀerence between the actual F-
doping and just adding an electron to the system is the
maximum phonon energies. In the case of charge dop-
ing, the top phonon bands extend up to 60 meV (which
is similar to undoped case). The upper phonon band is
somewhat separated from the bottom phonon bands. In
the case of F-doping, the top-phonon band gets softer
and mixed up with the lower energy phonon bands. This
is expected as the F-atom has smaller diameter than oxy-
gen atom and when F is substituted at the oxygen site,
there will be more room for the surrounding atoms to

supercells, namely 2×2×1, 3×3×1, and 4×4×1 of the
LaOxF1−xBiS2. We also calculated the same dispersion
curve using the linear response theory, which does not
assume any supercell. We note that in 2 × 2 × 1 super-
cell, the calculations have the exact phonon energies only
at (0,0,0) and (π, π, 0) and therefore does not reﬂect the
correct dispersion curve. For 3 × 3 × 1 supercell, we have
exact phonon energies at Q = (n2π/3, m2π/3, 0)(n, m =
0, 1, 2). For 4 × 4 × 1 supercell, the exact phonon en-
ergies are at Q = (n2π/4, m2π/4)(n, m = 0, 1, 2, 3). In
supercell calculations the smooth dispersion curves are
obtained by assuming a real-space cutoﬀdistance for the
force-constant matrix. From Figure S2, it is clear that we
need at least 3×3×1 supercell to get the right dispersion
curves. The linear response theory, in excellent agree-
ment with the supercell calculations, also shows that
there are two unstable phonon branches along the entire
Q = (q, q, 0) direction. In Figure S3, we show only the
raw-data from linear response theory calculations, with-
out making any approximation for the real-space force
constants and cutoﬀ, that is needed to get the smooth
curves.

Figure S3 shows the structural parameters of the fer-
roelectric phase of LaOBiS2 after the tetragonal struc-
ture is distorted by the most negative energy mode
and then fully relaxed.
