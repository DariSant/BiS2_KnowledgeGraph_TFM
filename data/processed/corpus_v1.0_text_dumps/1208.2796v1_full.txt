KEYWORDS: Bi4O4S3, Speciﬁc heat
Since the recent discovery of superconductivity in
Bi4O4S3, the BiS2-based superconducting family has at-
tracted many researchers1–11) because of some analo-
gies to cuprates and Fe-based superconductors.12–14) The
parent phase of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor is Bi6O8S5
with a crystal structure composed of a stacking of Bi2S4
layers (two BiS2 layers) and Bi4O4(SO4) spacer layers.1)
Band calculations1, 9) indicate that Bi6O8S5 is an insula-
tor with Bi3+. Superconducting Bi4O4S3 is expected to
possess 50% defects at a SO4 site, which generates elec-
tron carriers within the BiS2 layers. In fact, supercon-
ductivity of Bi4O4S3 is induced by electron doping into
the BiS2 layers via the defects of the SO4 ions at the
interlayer site.1) To date, LaOBiS2 and NdOBiS2, hav-
ing analogous BiS2 layers, have been found to show su-
perconductivity by electron doping as well.2, 3) Although
the nature of superconductivity in the BiS2 family has
not been clariﬁed so far, the relatively high transition
temperature (Tc), for example, 10.6 K in La(O,F)BiS2,
attracts researchers to exploring new BiS2-based super-
conductors with a higher Tc. To elucidate the supercon-
ductivity mechanism or design new BiS2-based supercon-
ductors, it is important to clarify whether the observed
superconductivity is bulk or occurred in surface. Here we
show the evidence of bulk superconductivity in Bi4O4S3
revealed by the speciﬁc heat measurements.
The polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 sample was prepared by
the conventional solid-state reaction method as described
in Ref. 1. The sample quality was conﬁrmed by the x-ray
diﬀraction and dc susceptibility measurements. It was
comparable to the result reported in Ref. 1. The Tc was
estimated to be ∼4.7 K. Speciﬁc heat was measured
with a thermal relaxation method with a commercial
calorimeter (PPMS, Quantum Design) down to 2 K.
Figure 1 shows the temperature dependence of the to-
tal speciﬁc heat CP in the superconducting state (µ0H =
0 T) and in the normal-conducting state (µ0H = 9 T >
µ0Hc). The CP anomaly associated with the supercon-
ducting transition is observed, as indicated by the arrow
(T ≃4.7 K). This result ensures that Bi4O4S3 is a bulk
superconductor. The tiny jump is attributed to the small
electronic-speciﬁc-heat coeﬃcient γ. Assuming the BCS
weak coupling approximation, ∆CP /γTc = 1.43 and
100% superconducting volume, the γ value was yielded

presents the ﬁtting result by a conventional relation,
CP /T = γ + βT 2, with the estimated γ and the coef-
ﬁcient of the phononic contribution β. Although lower-T
data need to evaluate the certain γ value, the data is
fairly ﬁtted by the relation with β = 3.0 mJ/(f.u. mol

for the superconducting mechanism of the BiS2-based
superconductor.
From the intrinsic jump of CP , we deﬁne the transi-
tion temperature Tc = 4.4 K in zero ﬁeld, which agrees
well with the temperature of the zero-resistivity and the
starting temperature of the bifurcation between χFC and
χZFC. In Fig. 2, comparisons between those results are
presented. For the CP data, the diﬀerence in the elec-
tronic speciﬁc heat between the superconducting and
normal-conducting states is estimated by a relation of
∆CP = CP (0T) −CP (9T), since the phononic contri-
bution in CP is usually H independent. We have ﬁtted
the 9 T data to a polynomial, and used it in calculat-
ing ∆CP . We obtained the intrinsic jump height at Tc
as ∆CP /Tc = 4.0 mJ/(f.u. mol K2). We note that there
is a small discrepancy between CP data of the supercon-
ducting and normal-conducting states above Tc. How-
ever, this is only 2% of the total speciﬁc heat. There-
fore, we think that this is not intrinsic in the nature of
Bi4O4S3, instead it is attributable to a small error of
measurements or of the subtraction of the normal state
contribution, because of the small speciﬁc heat jump.
In conclusion, our speciﬁc heat experiments on a
polycrystalline sample of the BiS2-based superconduc-
tor Bi4O4S3 demonstrate that the superconductivity of
it is bulk in nature. The Tc is estimated by the spe-
ciﬁc heat measurements to be Tc = 4.4 K, consistent
with that of the resistivity and dc susceptibility. In or-
der to further discuss the superconductivity mechanism
of Bi4O4S3, lower temperature speciﬁc heat experiments
below 2 K is essential.
