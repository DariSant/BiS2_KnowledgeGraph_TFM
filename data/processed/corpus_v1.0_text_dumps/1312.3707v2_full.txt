Abstract: We report superconducting properties of PrO1-xFxBiS2 compounds, synthesized by 
the vacuum encapsulation technique. The synthesized PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 
0.9) samples are crystallized in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. Both transport and DC 
magnetic susceptibility measurements showed bulk superconductivity below 4 K. The 
maximum Tc is obtained for x = 0.7 sample. Under applied magnetic field both Tc onset and 
Tc (ρ =0) decrease to lower temperatures. We estimated highest upper critical field [Hc2(0)] 
for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample to be above 4 T (Tesla). The thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) 
activation energy (U0) is estimated 54.63 meV in 0.05 Tesla field for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. 
Hall measurement results showed that electron charge carriers are the dominating ones in 
these compounds. Thermoelectric effects (Thermal conductivity and Seebeck coefficient) 
data suggest strong electron-electron correlations in this material.

Introduction: 
Very recently discovered superconductivity in BiS2 based layered compounds has 
attracted much attention of various groups, because these compounds have similar layered 
structure as in famous cuprates high Tc superconductors (HTSc) and iron Pnictides 
superconductors. Superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 with Tc=8.6K and (La/Nd/Ce/Pr)O0.5F0.5BiS2 
with Tc=3-10 K [1-11] has recently been reported. It is expected that cuprates and iron 
pnictides compounds, containing 3d transition metals, exhibit superconductivity within their 
layered structures. Superconducting transition temperature can be varied by the changing 


 
2
blocking layer. Here, the basic structural unit, i.e., BiS2 layer is similar to the CuO2 planes in 
Cu–based superconductors [12] and the FeAs planes in iron pnictides [13]. The parent phase 
of these compounds i.e., ReOBiS2 (Re= La, Nd, Ce, & Pr) is a bad metals or quasi insulator. 
The doping of charges carriers improves the electrical conduction and exhibit 
superconductivity at low temperatures. The doping mechanism of the BiS2 based 
superconductors is seemingly the same as for Fe pnictides [14, 15]. It has also been suggested 
that superconductivity emerges in close proximity to an insulating normal state [16].  
Substituting F for O induces superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors. 
Superconductivity is achieved by doping of the oxide blocks (LaO), which acts as spacer 
layer. In case of LaO1−xFxBiS2 superconductivity appears at x = 0.2, reaches a maximum at x 
= 0.5 and is gradually suppressed and disappeared at x = 0.7 [3, 8, 17].  The superconducting 
transition temperature is the highest at the optimal doping point of around x = 0.5. 
Superconductivity has also been observed by electrons doping via substitution of tetravalent 
Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4, and Ti+4 for trivalent La+3 in LaOBiS2 [18]. Superconductivity was also 
reported in SrFBiS2 compound, via hole doping through substitution of La at the site of Sr 
[19]. SrFBiS2 seems to be the ground state of these BiS2 based layered superconductors [19]. 
The pressure dependent resistivity experiments have been performed on Bi4O4S3, 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 and Pr O0.5F0.5BiS2 samples [17, 20-22,], and 
the results indicated the enhancement of superconductivity accompanied by the suppression 
of semiconducting behavior with increase in pressure. Multiband behavior with dominant 
electron carriers in these materials has been observed by both experimental and theoretical 
studies and electron carriers are being known to be originated from the Bi 6p orbital [23]. 
These newest layered BiS2-based superconducting systems are very sensitive to the carrier 
doping level, as the atomic substitutions cause profound changes in their properties, and 
superconductivity appears in the vicinity of the insulating-like state. A chance to explore 
superconductivity and increase Tc in these new compounds has already resulted in a lot of 
work that appeared shortly after their discovery [1-11, 18–22]. Hall effect measurements 
revealed multiband features and suggested that superconducting pairing occurs in one 
dimensional chains [16]. These compounds do also possess reasonably good thermoelectric 
properties [24].  
In this paper, we report on the synthesis and doping dependence of Tc in PrO1-xFxBiS2 
compounds. All samples are crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group, the c lattice 
parameter decrease with the doping of F for x=0.7 and then slightly increase for higher 
concentration. Superconducting temperature (Tc onset ~ 4.5 K) is highest for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2

sample. Here we present structural, electrical and thermal transport properties of the PrO1-
xFxBiS2 samples.  
 
Experimental: 
 
 
Bulk polycrystalline PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 & 0.9) samples were 
synthesized by standard solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Pr, 
Bi, S, PrF3, and Pr6O11 are weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove 
box under high purity argon atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and 
vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in a quartz tube. Sealed quartz ampoules were placed in box 
furnace and heat treated at 7800C for 12h with the typical heating rate of 2oC/min., and 
subsequently cooled down slowly to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-
ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range 
of 10o-80o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). 
Rietveld analysis was performed using the standard FullProf program. Detailed dc and ac 
transport and magnetization measurements were performed on Physical Property 
Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design). 
 
Results and discussion: 
 
 
Figure 1 shows the room temperature observed and Reitveld fitted XRD pattern of as 
synthesized PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.1 to 0.9) samples. The compounds are crystallized in 
tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm. Small amount of Bi and Bi2S3 impurities are 
also seen within main phase of the compound. As seen from the XRD patterns in Figure 1, 
the impurity phases are quite small and present in all the samples. Though, we did not 
quantify exactly the amount of impurities present in main phase of the samples, but the same 
does not appear to have direct impact on observation of superconductivity. The Rietveld 
fitted results show that the a axis of PrO1-xFxBiS2 is 4.014(2) Å for x = 0.1, which increases to 
4.019(1) Å for x = 0.7, and then slightly decreases to 4.018(2) Å for x = 0.9. The c-axis lattice 
constant decreases from 13.508(3) Å to 13.360(1) Å as x is increased from x = 0.1 to 0.7 and 
the same increase slightly to c = 13.386(4) Å for x = 0.9. This result indicates that the layer 
structure slightly expands in the in-plane direction and compressed in c-direction with F 
doping, reaches a maximum at x = 0.7, and then starts to shrink at x = 0.9. Decrease of the c-
axis lattice parameter indicate that F has been successfully substituted at the O site, as the 
ionic radius of F is smaller than that of O. Similar trend of lattice parameters is reported for 
NdO1-xFxBiS2 and CeO1-xFxBiS2 compounds [9, 16]. As far as increase of the c-axis lattice 


 
4
parameter for x = 0.9 sample is concerned, we believe that the doping of F at O site in 
PrOBiS2 is successful only up to x = 0.7.  
 
 
DC magnetic susceptibility under the applied magnetic field of 10 Oe is shown in 
Figure 2. Magnetization measurements are performed in both ZFC (Zero Field Cooled) and 
FC (Field Cooled) protocols for the studied PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) samples. 
The compounds exhibit diamagnetic transition at around 2.5 K for x = 0.3, 3.0 K for x = 0.5, 
3.7 K for x = 0.7, and at 3.5 K for x = 0.9. A superconducting transition is observed for all the 
F-doped samples. All samples show reasonable shielding volume fraction, indicating the 
appearance of bulk superconductivity in these samples. Namely, the same is around 8%, 
43%, 80% and 33% for x = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 samples of PrO1-xFxBiS2 series.  The 
PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample exhibits the maximum shielding volume fraction of ~ 80% and the 
highest Tc (3.7 K) as well, among all the studied samples. Inset of Figure 2, shows the ac 
magnetic susceptibility of PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample, confirming the bulk superconductivity at 
around 3.7 K. The ac magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out at varying 
amplitude from 3-10 Oe and fixed frequency 333 Hz. It can be seen that with change in 
amplitude from 3-10 Oe the imaginary part peak height is increased along with increased 
diamagnetism in real part of ac susceptibility. The interesting part is that with increasing AC 
amplitude the imaginary part peak position temperature (3.7 K) is not changed. This is an 
indication that the superconducting grains are well coupled PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 superconductor.   
 
 
The temperature dependence of the resistance for the PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 
0.5, 0.7, and 0.9) samples is shown in Figure 3. Pure PrOBiS2 sample shows semiconducting 
behavior at low temperatures without appearance of superconductivity down to 2 K. With 
doping of F at O site, superconductivity appears and Tc is seen increasing till x = 0.7 further 
the same is decreased for x = 0.9. A superconducting transition is observed for all the F 
doped samples. The samples with x =0.7 exhibit high Tc onset of above 4.5 K, inset of the 
figure shows the zoom part of the R-T plots from 1.5- 5 K. The superconducting transition 
temperature (Tc) is slightly higher as being seen from the magnetization measurements 
(Figure. 2) than the magnetization studies (Fig. 2). This may be due to the fact that the 
transport measurements require only the percolation path for the resistance less current to 
flow. On the other hand the magnetization measurements require reasonable diamagnetic 
fraction for the superconductivity to be seen. However, the general trend of the variation of Tc 
with x is the same as being seen from both transport and magnetization measurements. The x 
dependence of lattice parameter c (Å) and Tc (magnetization) is plotted in Figure 4. The Tc of 
the all samples varies with the lattice constant as well as x concentration. It is highest for 


 
5
lowest c lattice constant. This indicates that the chemical pressure is increasing with the F 
concentration till x = 0.7 and at further concentration of x= 0.9, the Tc is decreased. It is 
concluded that with decreasing lattice constant the superconducting transition Tc is increasing. 
As mentioned in XRD results, the doping of F at O site in PrOBiS2 is seemingly successful 
only up to x = 0.7, perhaps this is the reason that Tc is not increased beyond x = 0.7.  
  
 
 
The temperature dependence of resistivity under applied magnetic field is shown in 
Figure 5 (a), (b), and (c) for the three samples i.e., x = 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 respectively. Tc
onset 
decreases less compared to Tc(R=0) with the increasing magnetic field, hence the transition 
width is broadened. Similar broadening of the transition was observed in the high-Tc layered 
cuprate and Fe-pnictide superconductors. The upper critical field Hc2 versus T for 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 and PrO0.1F0.9BiS2 is shown in the Figure 6.  Hc2 is estimated 
using the conventional one-band Werthamer–Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) equation, i.e., 
Hc2(0) = −0.693Tc(dHc2/dT)T=Tc. The Hc2 corresponds to the temperatures, where the 
resistivity drops to 90% of the normal state resistivity ρn(T,H) at Tc
onset  in applied magnetic 
fields. The solid lines are the result of fitting of Hc2(T) to the WHH formula. The estimated 
Hc2(0) is 2.7 Tesla for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, 4.8 Tesla for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2, and 3.8 Tesla for 
PrO0.1F0.9BiS2.   
The temperature derivatives of resistivity (dρ/dT) for the superconducting samples 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 and PrO0.1F0.9BiS2 are shown in Figure.7 (a), (b) and (c) 
respectively. It is clear that only a single transition peak is seen for every applied field. This 
single superconducting transition suggests better grains coupling in these systems. Also we 
observed some broadening of peaks with increasing applied magnetic field. The broadening 
of dρ/dT peak for increasing applied field suggests that superconducting onset is relatively 
less affected than the Tc (ρ=0) state. Due to the thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) there is 
broadening of resistive transitions under applied magnetic fields [25]. The resistance in 
broadened region is due to the creep of vortices, which are thermally activated. The resistivity 
in this region can be given by Arrhenius equation [26, 27], 
ρ(T,B) = ρ0 exp[ - U0/kBT] 
Where, ρ0 is the field independent pre-exponential factor (the normal state resistance at 5K 
i.e., ρ5K is taken as ρ0), kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and U0 is TAFF (thermally activated 
flux flow) activation energy, which can be obtained from the slope of the linear part of an 
Arrhenius plot in low resistivity region. We have plotted experimental data as ln(ρ/ρ5K) 
versus T-1 in Figure 8 (a), (b) and (c)  for all three samples. The best fitted data give values of 


 
6
the activation energy, which varies from 54.63 meV to 1 meV in the magnetic field range of 
0.05 to 1 Tesla for the PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. The magnetic field dependence of activation 
energy (U0) for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 and PrO0.1F0.9BiS2 samples is shown in Figure 
9.  
 
 
Hall effect measurements of superconducting PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample are shown in the 
figure 10. The temperature dependence of RH has been carried out at a magnetic field of 1 
Tesla from 300 K down to 2 K.  The negative RH signal is observed for the given temperature 
range, indicating that the dominant charge carriers are electrons similar to that as in iron 
based superconductors [19].  The inset of the Figure 10, depicts magnetic field dependent ρxy 
at different temperatures from 2 – 300 K of the same sample. Hall resistivity ρxy is measured 
with longitudinal current and perpendicular magnetic field (H = 0-5 Tesla) to the surface of 
the sample and the voltage Vxy is measured across the direction of sample width. Here ρxy 
remains negative for all temperatures, indicating that the electrons are the dominating current 
carriers in the system. Further the ρxy exhibited curved transition like feature at 2 K, below 
say 1.5 Tesla. For higher temperatures (10 K – 300 K) the resistivity remains negative and 
linear. The curved feature below 1.5 Tesla at 2K happens due to the fact that the compound is 
superconducting below this temperature and applied fields.  For higher fields (> 1.5 Tesla) 
the Vxy at 2 K is again linear and negative because the compound is turned to normal 
conductor at this field. When ρxy exhibits a linear behavior with the magnetic field, the RH can 
be measured by RH = dρxy/dH = 1/ne, for a single band metal, where n is the charge carrier 
density. Using a single band assumption and taking the value of RH at 5 K, we get the charge 
carrier density of 3.84 × 1019/cm3.  Worth caution is the fact that the single band metal model 
could not work for the BiS2 based superconductors [16] and the situation may be similar to 
the case of Fe pnictides and hence the carrier calculation may need corrections.  
 
 
 
Figure 11 shows thermal conductivity κ (T) and Seebeck coefficient S(T) results of 
PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. Thermal conductivity in the PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 compound is seemingly 
dominated by phonons and the electron contribution being calculated by the Wiedemann–
Franz law may be negligible. Similar situation is found for SmFeAs(O0.93F0.07) [28]. Smaller 
κ values in PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 may represent the crystallographic disorder. An enhancement of κ 
value above the superconducting temperature 5 K is due to the gap opening at the Fermi 
surface, followed by carrier condensation and consequent suppression of electron-phonon 
scattering. Seebeck coefficient S(T) is linearly dependent with temperature. The negative S(T) 
for whole measurement temperature region, indicates the electron-like carriers. The S(T) 


 
7
results support the Hall measurements data.  Relatively larger S of around 30µV/K and low 
thermal conductivity of 1W/mK is reminiscent of strong electron correlation in these systems. 
Very recently the single crystals [29, 30] of ReOBiS2 (Re= La, Nd, Ce, & Pr) are being 
grown successfully and their thermal transport data could presumably lend more authentic 
information on these newest class of superconductors.      
 
Conclusion: 
 
 
In conclusion, the synthesized BiS2-based superconductor PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x=0.1-0.9) is 
crystallized in a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. Reitveld refinement results indicated 
successful substitution of F at O site. Both electrical resistivity and DC magnetic 
susceptibility measurements showed bulk superconductivity below 4K. The upper critical 
field [Hc2(0)] for the optimized PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample is estimated over 4 Tesla from ρ(T,H) 
measurements. The flux flow activation energy is estimated to be 54.63 meV in 0.05 Tesla 
field for PrO0.3F0.7BiS2 sample. Hall measurement and thermal transport results indicate 
dominance of electron charge carriers along with strong electron correlation in this 
compound. Though the Tc of F doped ReOBiS2 is relatively low (2-10K), yet their layered 
structure, the character ground state, doping pattern, broadening of superconducting transition 
under magnetic field along with higher S and low κ  could put them close to high Tc  cuprates 
and Fe pinctide superconductors.
