Abstract 
We have synthesized a new layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6. From synchrotron 
X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, the crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 was refined 
using a model of the P4/nmm space group with a = 4.0644(1) Å and c = 19.412(1) Å, which is 
similar to the related compound LaOBiPbS3, while the interlayer bonds (M2-S1 bonds) are 
apparently shorter in La2O2Bi3AgS6. The tunneling electron microscopy (TEM) image confirmed 
the lattice constant derived from Rietveld refinement (c ~ 20 Å). The electrical resistivity and 
Seebeck coefficient suggested that the electronic states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than 
those of LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3. The insertion of a rock-salt-type chalcogenide into the van der 
Waals gap of BiS2-based layered compounds, such as LaOBiS2, will be a useful strategy for 
designing new layered functional materials in the layered chalcogenide family.

1. Introduction 
Layered compounds have been extensively studied in the fields of superconductivity 
and thermoelectric materials [1-6] because of the high flexibility of the stacking structure and the 
constituent elements. In addition, low-dimensional electronic states can be generated, and thus, 
unconventional superconductivity or exotic functionality has been revealed in several materials. 
Recently, BiS2-based layered compounds, whose crystal structure is composed of 
alternate stacks of electrically conducting BiS2 bilayers and various kinds of electrically insulating 
(blocking) layers, have drawn much attention as superconductors [7-16] and thermoelectric 
materials [17-21]. The typical parent phase is REOBiS2 (RE: Rare earth element). From band 
calculations [22,23], the parent phase is basically an insulator with a band gap. The conduction 
band just above the Fermi energy is mainly composed of Bi-6p (px and py) bands. Typically, the 
partial substitution of O2- at the blocking REO layers with F- generates electron carriers in the 
BiS2 layer, and superconductivity has been observed in REO1-xFxBiS2 [9-14]. The highest reported 
superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in this family is 11 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [24], although 
a possible high Tc phase with Tc ~ 20 K was detected for Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystal using 
scanning tunneling spectroscopy [25]. In addition, the possibility of unconventional mechanisms 
of the superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds has been recently proposed [26-29]. Thus, 
further exploration of the new superconducting phases and clarification of the mechanisms are 
desired. The BiS2-based compounds exhibit high thermoelectric performance. The highest 
reported thermoelectric dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) in this family is 0.36 at 650 K for 
LaOBiSSe [18]. The high ZT was achieved by the enhancement of carrier mobility and the low 
thermal conductivity [18,19]. To further enhance ZT, exploration of new BiS2-type layered 
compounds is needed. 
Very recently, we have reported the crystal structure and site selectivity of LaOBiPbS3 
[30], which was discovered to be a thermoelectric material [20]. From neutron diffraction, we 
revealed the site selectivity of Bi and Pb in LaOBiPbS3. On the basis of crystal structure 
refinements with neutron and synchrotron X-ray diffraction, it was found that the crystal structure 
of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as the alternate stacks of PbS layers and LaOBiS2 layers. In 
addition, the insertion of PbS layers results in an electronic structure (at around the Fermi energy) 
apparently different from that of LaOBiS2. If another type of chalcogenide layer can be 
sandwiched by LaOBiS2 layers, a new layered oxychalcogenide can be synthesized with a 
modified electronic structure, which may be useful for the emergence of superconductivity or 
high thermoelectric performance. In this study, we have designed and synthesized a new layered 
bismuth oxysulfide La2O2Bi3AgS6 with the concept obtained from the crystal structure of 
LaOBiPbS3. The crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 is composed of stacks of (Bi0.66Ag0.34)S 
chalcogenide layers and LaO(Bi0.9Ag0.1)S2 layers, as displayed in Fig. 1.

2. Experimental Details 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 polycrystalline samples were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. 
Powders of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), and Ag (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%) and S 
(99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3AgS6 were mixed in a mortar, pelletized, sealed 
in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 720 °C for 15 h. The obtained sample was ground, 
mixed to homogenize it, pelletized, and heated at 720 °C for 15 h. The phase purity of the prepared 
samples and the optimal annealing conditions were examined using laboratory X-ray diffraction 
(XRD) with Cu-K radiation. Synchrotron XRD was performed at BL02B2 of SPring-8 with an 
energy of 25 keV (project number: 2016B0074). The synchrotron XRD experiments were 
performed with a sample rotator system at room temperature, and the diffraction data were 
collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector (MYTHEN) [31] with 
a step of 2 = 0.006º. The crystal structure parameters were refined using the Rietveld method 
with RIETAN-FP [32]. Schematic images of the crystal structure were drawn using VESTA [33]. 
The ratio of Bi to Ag in the obtained sample was examined using energy dispersive X-ray 
spectroscopy (EDX) with a TM3030 microscope. Tunneling electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL, 
JEM-2010) was performed with an accelerating voltage of 200 keV. An ethanol suspension of the 
powder was dispersed on a commercial grid. The temperature dependence of the electrical 
resistivity was measured by the four-probe method. For high-temperature measurements, the 
probes were mechanically attached to the sample, while Ag paste was used to attach Au wires to 
the sample for low-temperature measurements. The Seebeck coefficient was measured by the 
four-probe method as well as high-temperature resistivity. In this article, the sample is named 
La2O2Bi3AgS6, which is the starting nominal composition. 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
As shown in Fig. 1(c), the refined structure for La2O2Bi3AgS6 was found to be similar 
to that of LaOBiPbS3 with the space group of P4/nmm [20,30] [Fig. 1(b)]. La2O2S (P-3m1: #164) 
and AgBiS2 (Fm-3m: #225) impurity phases were also detected. The LaOBiS2 phase with the 
space group of P4/nmm was hardly detected. Although the peaks of AgBiS2 are broad, the 
existence of AgBiS2 was also confirmed by the observation of particles with the composition of 
Ag:Bi:S = 1:1:2 by EDX. Figure 2 shows the multiphase Rietveld refinement profile obtained 
using synchrotron XRD. With the P4/nmm model and two impurity phases, the XRD pattern was 
refined with a resulting reliability factor of Rwp = 11.6%. Rwp was not as low as that obtained for 
LaOBiPbS3 (Rwp = 7.5% [30]), measured in the same beamline and analyzed with the same 
structural model. This is attributed to the shoulder of the peaks at a lower angle than the major 
phase, which may be due to the low crystallinity of the phase. The obtained structure parameters 


4 
 
are listed in Table I. The lattice constants of a = 4.0644(1) Å and c = 19.412(1) Å are smaller than 
those of LaOBiPbS3: a = 4.09716(4) Å and c = 19.7933(2) Å. The differences in lattice constants 
are consistent with the smaller ionic radius of Ag+ than that of Pb2+: 1.15 Å for Ag+ and 1.19 Å 
for Pb2+ when the coordinate number is 6. In addition, the smaller lattice constants are consistent 
with the large amount of Bi3+ ions, with an ionic radius of 1.03 Å, in La2O2Bi3AgS6. 
In Fig. 1, Bi-S bonding is depicted when the bond length is shorter than 2.95 Å. The 
M2-S1 bond length [2.82(3) Å] is clearly shorter than that in LaOBiPbS3 [3.018(9) Å], which 
should enhance the interlayer transfer of carriers. The short interlayer bonding may be due to the 
suppression of the effects of lone pairs because Bi3+ and Pb2+ have 6s lone pairs, which affect the 
local structure of the conducting layers in LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3. Because Ag+ does not have 
lone pairs, the interlayer bonding may decrease, as observed in the InS2-based compound LaOInS2 
[34]. From the refinement, the Bi concentration can be estimated as 3.1(1), which is almost the 
same as the starting nominal composition. EDX analysis also confirmed that the composition of 
most of the area almost corresponded to the starting nominal composition. 
 
Figure 3 shows a TEM image of the La2O2Bi3AgS6 sample. We confirmed the existence 
of fringes with a length of approximately 20 Å, corresponding to the lattice constant of c obtained 
from the Rietveld refinement. Nonetheless, fringes with a length of 14 Å, close to the c-axis of 
LaOBiS2, were seen [9]. Such disorder has also been seen in Bi4O4S3 and related compounds 
[35,36]. Although clear diffraction peaks of LaOBiS2 were not seen in the XRD pattern, TEM 
diffraction suggests that the exact structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 is rather complicated, and the above 
Rietveld analysis can thus derive the average structure without considering the local disorder.  
 
Figure 4 shows the temperature dependences of the electrical resistivity for LaOBiS2 
[Fig. 1(a)], LaOBiPbS3 [Fig. 1(b)] [37] and La2O2Bi3AgS6 [Fig. 1(c)]. As mentioned in the 
introduction, LaOBiS2 becomes a superconductor when electron carriers are doped by elemental 
substitution. Notably, the resistivity of La2O2Bi3AgS6 is clearly lower than that of LaOBiS2 over 
a wide temperature range. In addition, the increase in resistivity at low temperatures observed for 
LaOBiS2 is not observed for La2O2Bi3AgS6, and almost temperature-independent resistivity is 
observed for La2O2Bi3AgS6. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependences of the Seebeck 
coefficient for LaOBiS2, LaOBiPbS3, and La2O2Bi3AgS6. The absolute value of the Seebeck 
coefficient is the smallest for La2O2Bi3AgS6 among these compounds. On the basis of the 
electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient, the carrier concentration in La2O2Bi3AgS6 is higher 
than that in LaOBiPbS3 and LaOBiS2. For LaOBiPbS3, band calculations revealed that the band 
structure is markedly changed by the insertion of a PbS layer into the van der Waals gap of 
LaOBiS2. The valence and conduction bands of LaOBiS2 and related BiS2-based compounds are 
basically composed of Bi-6p and S-3p orbitals in the same BiS plane [22,23]. In contrast, the 
valence band top of LaOBiPbS3 is mainly composed of S-3p bands of the PbS block while the 


5 
 
conduction band bottom is mainly composed of Bi-6p bands [30]. A similar situation, a valence 
band bottom composed of S bands of a NaCl-type Ag-rich layer, can also be expected in 
La2O2Bi3AgS6, and the carrier excitation may be enhanced in the present Ag case. The enhanced 
interlayer bonding (M2-S1 bonding) mentioned in the structure analysis part may be related to 
the enhanced electrical conductivity and increased carrier concentration. 
 
In the present study, we did not observe a superconducting transition. From 
magnetization measurements using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) 
magnetometer for La2O2Bi3AgS6, we confirmed the absence of a superconducting transition down 
to 2 K. In addition, from the resistivity measurements down to 3.8 K, we did not observe any 
onset of a superconducting transition. We expect that La2O2Bi3AgS6 will become a 
superconductor upon carrier doping or structural optimization, as observed for other BiS2-based 
superconductors [38]. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have reported the synthesis of a new layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6. On 
the basis of the material design concept revealed in LaOBiPbS3, rock-salt-type (Ag0.66Bi0.34)S 
layers are inserted into the BiS2-based LaO(Bi0.9Ag0.1)S2. From synchrotron XRD, Rietveld 
refinement, and TEM, the crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 was revealed, as shown in Fig. 1(c), 
which is similar to that of LaOBiPbS3 with the P4/nmm space group, and the lattice constant 
estimated from the Rietveld refinement and TEM had similar values (c ~ 20 Å). The temperature 
dependences of the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient suggested that the electronic 
states of La2O2Bi3AgS6 are more metallic than those of LaOBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3, which may be 
due to the formation of short M2-S1 bonds along the c-axis. The insertion of a rock-salt-type 
chalcogenide into the van der Waals gap of BiS2-based layered compounds, such as LaOBiS2, will 
be a useful strategy for designing new layered functional materials in the layered chalcogenide 
family.
