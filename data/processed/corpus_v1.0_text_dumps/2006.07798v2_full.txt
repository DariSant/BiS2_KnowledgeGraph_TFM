Abstract  
We have investigated low-temperature crystal structure of BiCh2-based compounds LaO1-
xFxBiSSe (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.5), in which anomalous two-fold-symmetric in-plane 
anisotropy of superconducting states has been observed for x = 0.5. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction 
experiments, a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic was observed for x = 0 and 0.01 at 
340 and 240 K, respectively. For x = 0.03, a structural transition and broadening of the diffraction peak 
were not observed down to 100 K. These facts suggest that the structural transition could be suppressed 
by 3% F substitution in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Furthermore, the crystal structure for x = 0.5 at 4 K was 
examined by low-temperature (laboratory) X-ray diffraction, which confirmed that the tetragonal 
structure is maintained at 4 K for x = 0.5. Our results suggest that the two-fold-symmetric in-plane 
anisotropy of superconducting states observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe was not originated from structural 
symmetry lowering.

1. Introduction 
BiCh2-based (Ch = S, Se) superconductor was discovered in 2012 [1,2], which was followed 
by the development of related layered compounds [3-13]. The crystal structure of typical BiCh2-based 
superconductor is an alternate stacking of an insulating layer and a BiCh2 conducting bilayer, which 
is similar to those of high-temperature superconductors such as cuprates and iron-based 
superconductors (IBSCs) [14,15]. Particularly, REOBiCh2-type (RE = Rare earth elements) 
compounds have been extensively studied due to its flexibility for elemental substitution of constituent 
elements. On the electronic characteristics, a parent phase of REOBiCh2 is a semiconductor with a 
band gap. Electron carrier doping by a partial substitution of F for the O site has been used to induce 
metallicity and then superconductivity in the system [2,3]. On the pairing mechanisms of the 
superconductivity in the BiCh2-based systems, there is still controversial; both conventional and 
unconventional mechanisms have been proposed from both theoretical and experimental studies [16]. 
For example, investigations on thermal conductivity, specific heat, and magnetic penetration depth 
have suggested a conventional model of superconductivity for BiCh2-based superconductors [17-19]. 
However, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study reported the observation of 
anisotropic superconducting gap, indicating unconventional superconductivity is emerging in 
NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 [20]. Furthermore, the absence of isotope effects was observed in LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S, 
Se)2, which was examined using 76Se and 80Se isotopes. This results also imply that unconventional 
pairing is essential for LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 [21]. 
Recently, two-fold symmetry in the ab-plane (in-plane) anisotropy of the magnetoresistance 
was observed in superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals [22]. From room-
temperature structural analysis using X-ray diffraction (XRD), the crystal structure was determined to 
be a tetragonal type (P4/nmm) having four-fold symmetry in the ab-plane [22,23]. Therefore, in the 
superconducting states, the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance is expected to break its structural 
symmetry in the conducting plane. This phenomenon is quite similar to what observed in nematic 
superconductors, AxBi2Se3 (A = Cu, Sr, Nb) and IBSCs [24-29]. In those nematic superconductors, 
two-fold symmetric anisotropy of physical properties in superconducting states has also been observed, 
in spite of three-fold (AxBi2Se3) or four-fold (IBSCs) symmetry in its crystal structure. For LaOBiSSe, 
however, there is still possibility of the emergence of two-fold symmetric anisotropy in the 
superconducting states due to structural symmetry lowering, because the parent phase (F-free) 
LaOBiSSe undergoes a structural transition from tetragonal (high-T phase: P4/nmm) to monoclinic 
(low-T phase: P21/m) at 300–400 K [3,23]. Furthermore, BiS2-based LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows a pressure-
induced structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic [30]. Since the origin of those structural 
transitions can be linked to the activity of the Bi lone-pair electrons, which affect local structures of 
the conducting BiCh2 layers [31], the structural instability could presence for all BiCh2-based systems. 
However, it has been known that carrier doping via partial element substitution suppresses the 


3 
 
structural transition and stabilizes tetragonal structure in a REOBiCh2-type structure [3]. As well, 
theoretical analysis on the stability of the crystal structure as a function of carrier concentration 
suggested that the tetragonal structure is more stabilized than monoclinic one in electron-doped (F-
substituted) LaOBiS2 [32].  
On the basis of those facts, systematic analyses on the crystal structure near the cross-over 
between tetragonal and monoclinic structure of LaO1-xFxBiSSe are, therefore, needed to understand 
the relationship between the two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of superconducting properties 
and possible nematic superconductivity. Here, we have studied temperature and carrier concentration 
dependences of crystal structure for LaO1-xFxBiSSe. A structural transition from tetragonal to 
monoclinic was observed at 340 K for x = 0 and at 240 K for x = 0.01. No structural transition and X-
ray diffraction peak broadening were not observed for x = 0.03 down to 100 K. These results suggest 
that the structural transition is rapidly suppressed by carrier doping and disappears at x ~ 0.03 in LaO1-
xFxBiSSe. Furthermore, we have confirmed that the tetragonal structure has been maintained at 4 K 
for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (x = 0.5), where anomalous two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of 
superconducting states was observed. 
 
2. Material and methods 
Polycrystalline samples of LaO1-xFxBiSSe (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.5) were prepared 
by solid-state-reaction method. Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 were pre-synthesized by reacting Bi (99.999%), S 
(99.9999%), and Se (99.999%) grains. Powders of La2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), BiF3 (99.9%), Bi2S3, 
and Bi2Se3, and Bi (99.999%) grains with nominal compositions of LaO1-xFxBiSSe were mixed, 
pressed into a pellet, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and annealed at 700˚C for 15 h. The obtained 
sample was mixed for homogenization, pressed into a pellet, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and 
annealed at 700˚C for 15 h. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) experiments were performed from 
400 to 300 K for x = 0 and from 300 to 100 K under the temperature control system with nitrogen gas 
for x = 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03 at the beamline BL02B2 of SPring-8 under research proposals Nos. 
2019A1114 ( = 0.496197 Å) and 2019B1195 (= 0.496391 Å). For x = 0.5, high-resolution powder 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments with a Cu-K radiation monochromatized by a Ge(111)-
Johansson-type monochromator at 300 and 4 K were performed on SmartLab diffractometer equipped 
with a GM refrigerator. The typical XRD patterns of both SXRD and conventional XRD experiments 
are shown in supplemental data (Figs. S1 and S2). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity 
was measured by four-terminal method with a DC current of 1 mA on a GM refrigerator.  
 
3. Results and discussion  
As reported in Refs. 3 and 13, the parent phase LaOBiSSe (x = 0) undergoes a structural 
transition from tetragonal (P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P21/m) at 300 – 400 K. In a monoclinic phase, the 


4 
 
200 peak splits into 200 and 020. Therefore, by scanning the 200 peak on temperature, the structural 
transition temperature (Ts) and the evolution of in-plane lattice constants (a and b) can be investigated. 
Figures 1(a–d) show the temperature dependences of the tetragonal 200 peak and monoclinic 200 and 
020 peaks on the SXRD patterns for x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.03, respectively. Commonly, the 200 peak 
shifts to higher angles on cooling, which is due to the compression of the lattice. As shown in Fig. 1(a), 
peak splitting of the 200 peak into the monoclinic 200 and 020 peaks was observed below 340 K for 
x = 0, which indicates a structural transition to the monoclinic structure at Ts = 340 K. Note that the 
peak intensity for x = 0 is rapidly suppressed with decreasing temperature as the temperature 
approached Ts. This is a signature of structural instability toward a structural transition (symmetry 
lowering) because the decrease in peak intensity during the temperature scanning corresponds to the 
broadening of the peak in this experimental setup, in which the sample condition was not modified 
and the temperature was continuously changed. A structural transition was observed for x = 0.01 at 
240 K. A similar trend on the suppression of peak intensity was observed in Fig. 1(b). For x = 0.02 and 
0.03, a clear structural transition was not observed down to 100 K. However, the suppression of the 
peak intensity was observed for x = 0.02. This signature implies that the sample has the structural 
instability, and a structural transition is expected at a temperature lower than 100 K. Notably, the peak 
intensity is almost constant from 300 to 100 K for x = 0.03, which implies that no structural transition 
is expected at temperatures lower than 100 K. To check the evolution of the peak broadening, the 
temperature evolutions of the full width half maximum (FWHM) of the 200 peaks estimated from the 
Gaussian fitting are also consistent with the scenario above (see Fig. S3 of Supplemental data). These 
results suggest that the structural transition can be completely suppressed at concentration lower than 
x = 0.03 in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. 
To analyze lattice constants a and b from the data shown in Fig. 1, the 200 and 020 peaks 
were fitted by one or two Gaussian functions. Two Gaussian functions were used for x = 0 and 0.01, 
where a clear structural transition was observed. For x = 0.02 and 0.03, we analyzed the lattice constant 
with one Gaussian function. Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependence of the lattice constants a 
and b for x = 0, which clearly shows a transition at Ts = 340 K. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the Ts for x = 
0.01 was 240 K. For x = 0.02 and 0.03, the lattice constant a linearly changed with decreasing 
temperature, which implies that the tetragonal structure is dominant in this temperature regime. The 
trend that the structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic is rapidly suppressed by F substitution 
in LaO1-xFxBiSSe is consistent with the theoretical study which proposed that the tetragonal structure 
is more stable than monoclinic in F-substituted LaOBiS2 [32].  
Figure 3 shows a structural phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Due to the experimental 
limitation, we could scan the lattice constant on temperature down to 100 K. From the evidence of the 
suppression of peak intensity, a structural transition at below 100 K for x = 0.02 is assumed. In contrast, 
since the peak intensity for x = 0.03 does not show a decrease down to 100 K, we assume that the low-


5 
 
temperature structure for x = 0.03 is tetragonal down to 0 K, which is indicated with a cross symbol 
in Fig. 3. 
To investigate the influence of the structural transition to the transport properties, the 
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was measured for x = 0 (Ts = 340 K), 0.01 (Ts = 240 
K), 0.02, and 0.03 (no transition is expected) and plotted in Fig. 4. As reported in Ref. 13, an upturn, 
non-metallic behavior is observed below 90 K for x = 0. For x = 0.01, metallic-like behavior was 
observed while a small upturn is observed at low temperature. Notably, there is no clear anomaly at 
TS, as indicated by an arrow, where a structural transition was detected (see Figs. 1 and 2). The absence 
of anomaly in the resistivity data is probably because of the small distortion of the in-plane structure 
(a/b ratio in the low-T phase) below the TS. The a/b ratio for x = 0.01 is 1.002, which indicates 0.2% 
in-plane distortion. For example, this is clearly smaller than 0.8% in-plane distortion that observed in 
layered compound BaFe2As2 [33], in which a clear anomaly is observed in its resistivity-temperature 
curve. For x = 0.02 and 0.03, a typical metallic behavior is observed. In addition, a small hump is 
observed at T = 150–200 K for x = 0.03. Since no structural anomaly was observed for x = 0.03 in the 
temperature range, we have no explanation about the anomaly at present. However, a similar anomaly 
has been reported for several Bi-chalcogenide layered compounds [34-36], and possible charge-
density-wave ordering has been suggested for EuFBiS2 [37].  
From the results described above, it is reasonable to expect that the low-temperature crystal 
structure of x = 0.5, in which two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of the magnetoresistance in the 
superconducting states was observed [22], is tetragonal with four-fold symmetry in ab-plane. To 
confirm this assumption, low-temperature laboratory XRD experiments were performed for x = 0.5 at 
4 K. Figure 5(a) shows the 200 peaks at T = 4 and 300 K collected with a Cu-K radiation using a 
pelletized sample. The peak at 4 K shifts to a higher angle because of lattice compression by cooling. 
Neither peak splitting nor broadening was observed for the 200 peak, indicating that the tetragonal 
structure is maintained at 4 K for x = 0.5. Figure 5(b) shows the 004 peaks collected at T = 4 and 300 
K for x = 0.5. No peak broadening is observed for the 004 peak at 4 K. From the structural 
investigations for LaO1-xFxBiSSe shown here, we suggest that the origin of the two-fold symmetric in-
plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is not 
structural one but another electronic one, as suggested for Bi2Se3-based nematic superconductors.  
 
4. Conclusions 
 We have investigated low-temperature crystal structure of BiCh2-based compounds LaO1-
xFxBiSSe (x = 0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and 0.5). From SXRD experiments, a structural transition from 
tetragonal to monoclinic was observed for x = 0 and 0.01. For x = 0.03, a structural transition and 
broadening of the diffraction peak were not observed down to 100 K. These facts suggest that the 
structural transition could be suppressed by 3% F substitution in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Furthermore, from 


6 
 
XRD experiments at T = 4 K, the crystal structure for x = 0.5 at 4 K was determined as tetragonal. The 
structural phase diagram obtained in this study suggests that the origin of the two-fold symmetric in-
plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is not 
structural one but another electronic one.
