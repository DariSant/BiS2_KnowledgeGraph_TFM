Abstract 
 
We measured the electrical resistivity of the BiS2-based compound EuFBiS2 under 
high pressure. Polycrystalline EuFBiS2 shows insulator-metal transition and pressure-induced 
superconductivity above 0.7 GPa. The superconducting transition temperature increases with 
increasing applied pressure and shows a maximum value around 8.6 K at 1.8 GPa.

Since the discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4(SO4)1−xBi2S4,1) much attention has 
been paid to developing BiS2-based layered superconductors. BiS2-based compounds have a 
layered structure composed of an alternate stacking of superconducting and blocking layers, 
which is a common feature of cuprate or Fe-based superconductors.2,3) The typical BiS2-based 
compound LaOBiS2 shows superconductivity by O substitution with F in the blocking layer,4) 
which supplies electron carriers into the BiS2 superconducting layer. This led to considerable 
advances in the BiS2-based superconducting family within a few years.5-18) Interestingly, 
many BiS2-based superconductors are sensitive to external pressure.19-22) The Tc enhancement 
has been attributed to the local structure sensitivity of the BiS2-based superconducting 
materials.23) 
 
Recently, it has been reported that the BiS2-based compound EuFBiS2 shows 
superconductivity even without any chemical doping.24-26) A charge-density-wave (CDW)-like 
behavior was simultaneously observed in its electrical resistivity.24) It is necessary to have 
more information about its physical properties by using other probes. In this study, we 
demonstrate the electrical resistivity measurements of EuFBiS2 under high pressure. It is 
found that the semiconducting sample shows insulator-metal transition and superconductivity 
is induced by only applying pressure. 
Polycrystalline samples of EuFBiS2 were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Powders 
of EuS, BiF3, and Bi2S3 were weighed with the nominal composition of EuFBiS2. The mixture 
was well-ground and pressed into pellets. The pellets were sealed in an evacuated quartz tube 
and then heated at 700 °C for 20 h. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement with Cu K 
radiation was carried out using Mini Flex 600 (RIGAKU). The compositional ratio was 
analyzed by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) using JSM-6010LA (JEOL). The 
electrical resistivity measurement was performed in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K 
using a physical property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) by a four-probe 
method. A piston-cylinder-type high-pressure cell was used for applying hydrostatic pressure 


3 
 
to the sample. Fluorinert 70/77 was employed as a pressure-transmitting medium. All the 
pressure values were estimated from the Tc of a Pb manometer, although the actual pressure 
around room temperature includes underestimation. 
 
The obtained sample is the single phase of EuFBiS2, and the diffraction peaks can be 
indexed on the basis of a tetragonal unit cell with the lattice parameters a = 4.0478(7) Å and c 
= 13.520(3) Å, as shown in Fig. 1. The compositional ratio is estimated to be Eu: F: Bi: S = 1: 
0.9(4): 0.9(5): 1.7(7) from EDX analysis, which is in good agreement with the nominal 
composition of EuFBiS2 within the error. 
 
The electrical resistivity at ambient pressure shows semiconducting behavior with a 
broad hump at around 230 K [Fig. 2(a)]. The resistivity increases with decreasing temperature, 
and is insulating in the temperature range below 180 K. The behavior drastically changes 
upon compression. The insulating behavior turns to metallic with applying pressure. This 
insulator-metal transition occurred at the pressure between 0.3 and 0.7 GPa. And also, the 
superconducting transition clearly appears at the pressure of 0.7 GPa as shown in Fig. 2(b). 
The onset superconducting transition temperature (Tc
onset) and zero-resistivity temperature 
(Tc
zero) are 5.2 and 2.1 K, respectively, at a pressure of 0.7 GPa. As shown in the lower panel 
of Fig. 2(c), both Tc
onset and Tc
zero exhibit a bell-shaped curve with the maximum of 8.6 K at 
1.8 GPa against the applied pressure.  
The broad hump at around 230 K at ambient pressure was gradually suppressed upon 
compression, and the peak temperature of the hump (Thump) decreased with increasing 
pressure, as shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2(c). It is interesting to note that there is a 
correlation between the hump suppression and superconducting appearance. When the hump 
is suppressed completely, Tc reaches its highest value at 1.8 GPa. 
Figure 3(a) shows the electrical resistivity at a pressure of 1.8 GPa under magnetic 
fields up to 3.5 T. The superconducting transition was suppressed with increasing magnetic 
field. The magnetic field dependences of Tc
onset and Tc
zero are shown in Fig. 3(b). The upper 


4 
 
critical field (Hc2) and irreversible field (Hirr) were estimated to be 3.0 and 1.5 T, respectively.  
It has been reported that the Tc of RE(O,F)BiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) series 
suddenly increases with increasing pressure.19-22) In the case of EuFBiS2, however, Tc 
increases gradually up to its maximum with increasing pressure. The gradual increases in Tc 
may evoke a correlation between Tc and its electron density of states at the Fermi level. There 
is a possibility that the europium valence changes with applied pressure. If the europium 
valence changes from +2 to +3 with applied pressure, more carriers are doped into BiS2 layers. 
The superconducting mechanism of EuFBiS2 still attracts considerable interest. Further 
investigations are required to understand the intrinsic properties of superconductivity of 
EuFBiS2, for example, structural analysis, magnetic property and specific heat measurements 
under pressure. 
 
In conclusion, the superconducting transition in EuFBiS2 was induced by only 
applying pressure. The electrical resistivity at ambient pressure showed semiconducting 
behavior with a broad hump at around 230 K. EuFBiS2 showed insulator-metal transition and 
the superconductivity was observed at a pressure of 0.7 GPa. Tc increased gradually with 
increasing pressure and showed a maximum of 8.6 K at a pressure of 1.8 GPa.
