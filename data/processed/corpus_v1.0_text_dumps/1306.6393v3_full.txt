Abstract 
Stimulated by the discovery of the giant birefringence (GBF) in LaOBiS2 (H. Wang, arxiv: 1304.5032), we 
check SrFBiS2 and find a superior birefringence up to 1.28. Naturally, AF layer (i.e., SrF) is considered to 
be of important and is demonstrated by the further study on AFBiS2 (A=Mg, Ca, Ba). Interestingly, 
MgFBiS2 is found to have the largest birefringence of about 1.60. Furthermore, the origin of GBF in 
AFBiS2 is discussed in detail based on first-principles calculations on the electronic structure and refractive 
index.

Birefringence (BF) is the optical anisotropy in refractive index due to the different light propagation 
velocity within the material. This effect was first found in calcite by Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 
1669.1 There are three well-known natural birefringent materials: calcite CaCO3 (δn=0.172), quartz SiO2 
(δn=0.009), and MgF2 (δn=0.006), all measured at 590 nm wavelength.1 However, the birefringence is so 
small that its application is limited severely. On the other hand, birefringence has been extensively used in 
imaging spectrometer, laser devices,2 optical components, photonic crystal fibers3 and quantum metrology4. 
Hence, seeking new birefringent materials is of important for both fundamental research and industrial 
application.5-6 7 There are at least two popular approaches: one is artificial crystal and the other is 
nanostructure engineering.  
Presently, nanostructure engineering seems to be only one effective approach. For example, the 
in-plane birefringence of nanostructured ZnO nanowire arrays is about one order of magnitude higher than 
that of quartz.8 And then, nanostructured GaP nanowires are found to have a giant birefringence (0.8),9 
which is enhanced up to 75 times than that of quartz. The giant birefringence (~ 0.2) is also report in 
anisotropically nanostructured silicon.10 Through dynamic control of growth geometry, the birefringence of 
nanostructured Si thin-films has a maximum up to 0.4, which is comparable to two-dimensional photonic 
crystals.11 Naturally, Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD)12 is developed to be and effective method for 
growth excellent birefringent nanostructured materials.  
On the other hand, artificial crystal has a relative small birefringence. For example, YVO4 has a 
birefringence about 0.22, which is inferior to rutile TiO2 (0.28). But YVO4 has been extensively used in 
laser devices and optical components owing to its easy growth, large refractive index and good mechanical 
properties.13 Recently, LaOBiS2 is predict to have a giant birefringence of 1.0, which is about 111 times 
larger than that of quartz.14 This is interesting because the single-crystal compound is first-time shown to 
have a superior BF than that of nanostructured materials through nanostructure-engineering. Whatever, the 
origin of GBF is unclear so far. In this work, we check the birefringence of AFBiS2 and discussed its origin 
in detail.  
The calculations in this work were performed using density functional theory (DFT). The more details 
can be found in Ref. 14. We first carried out the structural calculations on AFBiS2 and listed the results in 
Table I. For SrFBiS2, its lattice constant a is 1.1% larger than the experimental value, while the lattice 
constant c is 2.2% smaller. Similar situation has been report for LaOBiS2.15 Our results of LaOBiS2 agree 
well with previous experimental report.16 Both lattice constants a and c of AFBiS2 from Mg to Ba are

increase as A-ions radii increasing. This is expected because the larger ionic radii the larger lattice constant. 
On the other hand, AFBiS2 is expected to be semiconductor for optical applications. The calculated 
band-gaps are listed in Table I. It is clearly that all AFBiS2 are semiconductor with a gap in the range of 
0.8-1.0 eV. Note that, DFT-GGA method usually underestimates the band-gap, and there is no experimental 
data for comparison. To solve this problem, there are a number of methods, such as LDA+U, GW and 
hybrid functional. The hybrid functional HSE17 method are extensively used because its predicting 
band-gap value is very close to the experimental one. Here, the HSE band-gap of SrFBiS2 we calculated is 
1.35 eV, which should be closed to its true value. This band-gap value is suitable for solar-cell candidate. 
Hence, AFBiS2 may be also good photocatalysts for water splitting, degradation and catalysis. 
Now, we turn to the birefringent properties that we are interested in. The birefringence (see Fig.1) is 
found to be frequency-dependent as other optical properties, such as absorption. All AFBiS2 have negative 
BF when the photonic energy is less than 2 eV. The illustration gives the absolute value of the BF at the 
energy of zero, i.e., static BF (also listed in Table I). It is evident that all compounds considered here have 
the larger static birefringence than that of LaOBiS2. Interestingly, MgFBiS2 exhibits the largest BF of 1.66, 
which is 7.6 times larger than that of YVO4, the most extensively used birefringence laser crystal. The BF 
value of MgFBiS2 is 66% larger than that of LaOBiS2, which is is 4.5 times larger than YVO4 and is 
reported to have the largest inherent birefringence among inorganic compounds.14  
From Mg to Ba, the BFs of AFBiS2 show a very different trend as the photonic energy increasing. It is 
can be divided to five regions: [0, 2.0], [2.0, 2.9], [2.9, 5.3], [5.3,9.4] and [9.4, 16]. First region, the range 
of [0, 2.0] eV, the BF of AFBiS2 decreases as increasing the ionic radii of A-ions, i.e., there is about 26% 
reduction when A-ion changed from Mg to Ba. For the second region, the range of [2.0, 2.9] eV, the BF 
remains unchanged for all AFBiS2, indicating they have the same origin which has no connection with AF 
layers. In fact, it results from the interband transitions between Bi and S ions, as shown as PDOS (Figure 4). 
The third, the range of [2.9, 5.3] eV, the BF has an opposite trend compared to that in first region. The 
fourth region has a change of BF from the positive to negative. As for the fifth region, the trend is complex 
as A-ions changed. When energy is larger than 13 eV, the BF is less than 0.2.  
To reveal the origin of giant birefringence (GBF) in AFBiS2, we present the refractive index along [100] 
and [001] directions, respectively (Fig.2, we make as n100 and n001, respectively). Note that, the values of 
n100 (3.7-4.3) are evidently larger than the corresponding values (1.9-2.2) of YVO4. This means AFBiS2 
have a significant advantage in practical applications. The illustrations show the influence of A-ion radii on 


 
 
4 
the refractive index at the photonic energy of zero. It is evident that n100 is linearly reduced as ionic-radii 
increasing while n001 is not (see Fig. 2). Quantitatively, n001 is changed only about 0.1, while n100 is large up 
to 0.6. Note that, the value of n001 is nearly unchanged for Ca/Sr/Ba ions. The distinguished different 
influence of A-ions on n100 and n001 make the BF of AFBiS2 be mainly determined by the change of n100. We 
can conclude that A-ions or AF layers play an important role in the BF of AFBiS2.  
To insight the role of A-ions in AFBiS2, we now examine their electronic structures. Figure 3 presents 
the total density of state (TDOS). It is clear that TDOS has a significant change when energy is lower than 
-13 eV than that in the range of [-13, 9] eV. The reason may be found in their partial density of state 
(PDOS). Figure 4a shows that Mg-p orbital sites at -43 eV while Mg-s orbital less than -50 eV. The others 
A-s orbitals locate at -40, -33 and -25 eV for Ca, Sr and Ba, respectively. Meanwhile, A-p orbital of Ca, Sr 
and Ba is -21, -15 and -11 eV, respectively. As guided by the dot-lines, the sp-orbitals of A-ions are linearly 
moved up to Fermi level. This is attributed to the different sp-orbitals of A-ions. Because the F/S2 ions are 
neighbored with A-ions (see Figure 5), the PDOS of F and S ions are directly affected by A-ions, resulting 
the F/S-sp orbitals are also upward to Fermi level. The PDOS of Bi ions is affect by the Bi-S1 bonding. The 
covalent bonding also makes Bi (S)-s,p orbitals move up. In one word, A-ions can turn both A-F and Bi-S 
bonding through the orbital-hybridizations. Similar phenomenon have been report in BiMO3 ferroelectrics18 
and B-site complex BiMM'O3 compound.19 Furthermore, the Mulliken charges (Table II) also confirm that 
A-ions do have a significant influence on other ions.  
Electron localization function (ELF) measures the extent of spatial localization of the electrons and 
provides a method for the mapping of electron pair. The ELF of AFBiS2 is depicted in Fig.5. The anion F 
and A-cations (Mg, Ca and Ba) have no visible electrons. Here Sr ion is one exception. As expected, the 
lone pair on Bi3+ ions is evident for all AFBiS2. Bi3+ lone pair increases in shape, as A-ions changed from 
Mg to Ca, while remain unchanged from Ca to Sr and then Ba. This is consistent with the trend of n001 and 
may explain the very slight refractive index change for Ca, Sr and Ba (see Figure 2b). The S1 ions in Bi-S 
plane have also pseudo lone-pair electron in MgFBiS2, while along z axis another pseudo lone-pair appears 
in other three AFBiS2. The two symmetric pseudo S1 lone-pairs are observable and should result in the 
reduction of anisotropy of electronic structure. The S2 electrons (down drawing of Fig.5) increase from 
A-ions Mg changed to Ca, Ba (Sr, exception). This makes the anisotropy of ELF reduce, and should the 
reason of the reduction of n100 (Figure 2a). 
Now, we discuss the origin of GBF in detail. Table I indicates that the birefringence of AFBiS2 is 


 
 
5 
reduced when the ion-radii increases as well as the electronegativity reduces. This may be explained by the 
electronegativity different between A-F/O ions (δEE). The larger δEE means there is the larger covalent 
bonding of A-F. Note that, A-F bonding can turn the Bi-S bonding (Fig.4) as well as Bi/S lone-pair (Fig.5). 
Therefore, A-ions have an important role in the electronic structure of AFBiS2, in turn in both n100 and n001. 
The very different influence on n100 and n001 result in the large anisotropy, i.e., GBF. Table I shows that Ca 
and La have nearly the same ionic-radii, while CaFBiS2 has 36% larger BF than LaOBiS2. This means that 
CaF is more effective than LaO to obtain a large BF. On the other hand, this indicates that A-F/La-O 
bonding has a significant influence on Bi-S bonding as well as Bi/S lone-pair. Furthermore, AFBiS2 also 
needs good mechanical properties as a good candidate of birefringent crystal. Because A-ions can 
effectively turn the electronic structures as demonstrated above, hence, the mechanical properties are 
proposed to have good tunability. Further experimental exploring on the single-crystal growth and their 
mechanical character are highly expected.  
In summery, we have performed DFT calculations on AFBiS2, which are semiconductor and have 
superior birefringence than that of LaOBiS2. The DOS and Mulliken charges as well as ELF demonstrate 
that A-ions play an important role in turning the structural, electric properties and refractive index. A-ions 
have a very significantly different influence on the refractive index along [100] and [001] directions, 
resulting in giant birefringence. Finally, AFBiS2 are suggested to have promising potential applications in 
the fields of laser devices, optical component, solar-cell and photocatalyst.
