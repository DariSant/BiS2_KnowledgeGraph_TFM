 Recently, several types of BiS2-based superconductor such as Bi4O4S3,1) 
REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth), 2-6) and Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 
7,8) have been discovered. The 
typical parent material LaOBiS2 has a crystal structure composed of an alternate 
stacking of BiS2 conduction layers and LaO blocking layers. Electron carriers, which 
are essential for the appearance of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family, can be 
controlled by manipulating the structure and composition at the blocking layers. In 
LaOBiS2, electron carriers can be generated by a partial substitution of O2- with F-
.

The superconducting properties of the BiS2-based superconductors strongly depend 
on the sample preparation method. Solid-state-reacted LaO1-xFxBiS2 shows filamentary 
superconductivity; in other words, its superconducting volume fraction is low, whereas 
its superconducting states are evidently generated. To induce bulk superconductivity, 
high-pressure annealing 2,10) or application of high-pressure 11-13) is effective. Using the 
high-pressure technique, the transition temperature (Tc) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 reaches 10.6 
K. It was found that the crystal structure obviously changes after high-pressure 
annealing. Recently, we have reported that the uniaxial lattice contraction generated 
along the c axis could be positively linked to the enhancement of superconductivity in 
high-pressure-annealed LaO1−xFxBiS2.14)  
In this study, we focus on PrO0.5F0.5BiS2. It was reported that solid-state-reacted 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows bulk superconductivity with a Tc of 3.5 K.5) Furthermore, its Tc 


determined by the electrical resistivity measurement under high pressure reaches a 
maximum of 7.6 K.11) However, the correlation between the superconducting properties 
and the crystal structure under high pressure in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 remains to be clarified. 
Here, we show that the Tc of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is increased by high-pressure annealing, and 
that uniaxial contraction along the c axis observed after high-pressure annealing 
correlates with the increase in Tc. 
Polycrystalline samples of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 were prepared by a solid-state reaction 
using powders of Bi2O3 (99.9 %), BiF3 (99.9 %), Bi2S3, Pr2S3, and grains of Bi 
(99.99 %). The Bi2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Bi (99.99 %) and S (99.99 %) 
grains in an evacuated quartz tube. The Pr2S3 powder was prepared by reacting Pr 
(99.9 %) and S (99.99%) grains in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals used were 
purchased from Kojundo-Kagaku Laboratory. The starting materials with a nominal 
composition of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 were well-mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in an 
evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700 ºC for 10 h; in this article, we call this sample 
the “As-grown” sample. The obtained products were ground, sealed in an evacuated 
quartz tube and heated again under the same heating conditions to obtain a 
homogenized sample. The obtained sample was annealed at 600 ºC under high pressure 
of 3 G Pa for 1 h using a cubic-anvil high-pressure synthesis instrument; in this article, 
we call this material the “HP” sample. All the obtained samples were characterized by 
X-ray diffraction analysis using the 2method with CuK radiation. The temperature 
dependence of electrical resistivity was measured using the four-terminal method. The 
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured using a 
superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field 
of 5 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). 
Figure 1(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the As-grown and HP samples. 
Almost all of the obtained peaks were explained using the tetragonal P4/nmm space 
group. The numbers displayed in the profile indicate Miller indices. The obtained lattice 
constants were a = 4.0323 Å and c = 13.5038 Å for the As-grown sample, and a = 
4.0323 Å and c = 13.4587 Å for the HP sample. The obtained X-ray diffraction patterns 
are almost the same, but the peaks of the HP sample slightly shift and are broadened. To 
discuss the change in the lattice constants, the enlarged X-ray profiles around the (004) 
and (200) peaks are shown in Fig. 1(b) and 1(c), respectively. The (004) peak of the HP 


sample shifts to higher angles, which clearly indicates the contraction of the c axis with 
high-pressure annealing. In contrast, the (200) peak position does not change. Namely, 
the a axis does not show a remarkable change with high-pressure annealing. 
Nevertheless, it can note that the (200) peak of the HP sample is slightly broadened 
toward lower angles, which indicates that the a axis is slightly strained(expanded) with 
high-pressure annealing. These suggest that the c axis is easily compressed, while the a 
axis is stable under high pressure. Therefore, the uniaxial contraction along the c axis is 
induced after high-pressure annealing in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, as observed in the 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. 
Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for the 
As-grown and HP samples. For the As-grown sample, the resistivity decreases with 
decreasing temperature between 250 and 300 K, then slightly increases with decreasing 
temperature below 250 K. For the HP sample, the resistivity increases with decreasing 
temperature. Therefore, semiconducting characteristics are relatively enhanced by 
high-pressure annealing. Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependences of electrical 
resistivity for the As-grown and HP samples below 15 K. The As-grown sample shows 
transition temperatures of Tc
onset = 4.0 K and Tc
zero = 3.6 K. The HP sample shows 
transition temperatures of Tc
onset = 9.4 K and Tc
zero = 5.5 K. Tc
onset was defined as the 
temperature where the resistivity deviated from the extrapolation line, as indicated by 
arrows. 
Figure 3 shows the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility (ZFC) for the 
As-grown and HP samples. The As-grown sample shows a Tc
mag of 3.5 K, while the HP 
sample shows a Tc
mag of 5.0 K. A large shielding volume fraction,  < -1/4, is observed 
in the ZFC data at 2 K for both samples, indicating that both samples show bulk 
superconductivity. 
Here, we briefly discuss why Tc is increased in the HP sample. In the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
system, it was suggested that the increase in Tc is observed when the crystal structure 
changed from tetragonal to monoclinic under high pressure.13) If the crystal structure of 
the HP sample is monoclinic, we should observe the split of both the (200) and (004) 
peaks of the tetragonal As-grown sample. As shown in Fig. 1, these peaks of the HP 
sample are slightly broadened, but they do not split. Therefore, we assume that the 
crystal structure of the HP-annealed PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 with a higher Tc is basically 


tetragonal, and that a uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis is essential for the 
increase in Tc. It was predicted that the z coordinate of the in-plane S site could easily 
change with a change in F concentration and that the band structure significantly 
changes because of the change of the z coordinate of the S site.15,16) Recently, crystal 
structure analysis using LaO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals has revealed that the distortion of 
the Bi-S plane disappears with increasing F concentration.17) On the basis of these 
previous reports, we assume that the atomic position of the in-plane S site can be  
optimized by HP annealing, which results in an increase in Tc in HP-annealed 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
In summary, we investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of 
As-grown and high-pressure-annealed PrO0.5F0.5BiS2. We found that high-pressure 
annealing generates uniaxial lattice contraction along the c axis. Both As-grown and 
high-pressure-annealed PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 show bulk superconductivity. The Tc of 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is clearly increased from Tc
zero = 3.6 K to Tc
zero = 5.5 K by high-pressure 
annealing. Unexpectedly, the semiconducting characteristics are relatively enhanced by 
high-pressure annealing. Namely, we assume that the increase in Tc cannot be explained 
by an increase in the number electron carriers. Having considered these facts, we 
conclude that the increase in Tc correlates with the uniaxial lattice contraction along the 
c axis in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2.
