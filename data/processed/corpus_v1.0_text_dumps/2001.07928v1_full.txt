Abstract
We report the Se substitution effects on the crystal structure, superconducting properties, and 
valence states of self-doped BiCh2-based compound CeOBiS2-xSex. Polycrystalline CeOBiS2-xSex
samples with x = 0–1.0 were synthesized. For x = 0.4 and 0.6, bulk superconducting transitions 
with a large shielding volume fraction were observed in magnetic susceptibility measurements;
the highest transition temperature (Tc) was 3.0 K for x = 0.6. A superconductivity phase diagram 
of CeOBiS2-xSex was established based on Tc estimated from the electrical resistivity and 
magnetization measurements. The emergence of superconductivity in CeOBiS2-xSex was 
explained with two essential parameters of in-plane chemical pressure and carrier concentration, 
which systematically changed with increasing Se concentration.

1. Introduction
Since the discovery of BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO1-xFxBiS2, the 
BiCh2-based (Ch: chalcogen) systems have been drawing much attention as a new class of layered 
superconductors [1-3]. The crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of electrically 
conductive BiCh2 layers and insulating (blocking) layers, which is similar to those of the Cuprate 
and the FeAs-based superconductors with a high transition temperature (Tc) [4,5]. Several types 
of BiCh2-based superconductors have been synthesized and the structural and compositional 
variations have been widely developed. So far, many experimental and theoretical studies have 
been performed to elucidate the superconducting mechanisms of the BiCh2-based compounds and 
to further increase Tc, but the conclusion about the superconductivity mechanisms has not been 
obtained [6,7]. In the early studies including theoretical calculation [8], Raman scattering [9], 
muon-spin spectroscopy [10], and thermal conductivity [11] experiments suggested conventional 
mechanisms with fully gapped s-wave. On the other hand, recent first principles calculation [12], 
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [13], Se isotope effect [14], and in-plane anisotropy 
measurements [15] proposed unconventional pairing mechanism in BiCh2-based superconductors. 
The parent phase of the BiCh2-based superconductor is a band insulator [1,3,6,7,16]. 
Based on the calculated band structure, carrier doping to conduction bands which are mainly 
composed of Bi-6px and Bi-6py orbitals is expected to induce metallicity. Actually, partial F 
substitutions for the O site in REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth or Bi) generate electron carriers [2,3]. 
Indeed, superconductivity has been observed in carrier-doped compounds, but, for some of the 
synthesized samples, filamentary superconductivity with a small shielding volume fraction in 
magnetic susceptibility measurements has been observed [1-3]. In BiCh2-based compounds, the 
emergence of bulk superconductivity requires optimization of the local crystal structure as well 
as carrier doping. External pressure effects [17-20] and chemical pressure effects [21-24] are 
powerful methods to induce bulk superconductivity. Particularly, in-plane chemical pressure is an 
important factor for superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds [22]. One of the typical routes
to increase in-plane chemical pressure is partial substitution of Se for the S site [23-26]. In 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, since La-(O/F) bond length is not largely affected by Se substitution, an 
increase of amount of Se2- with larger ironic radius leads to enhancing in-plane chemical pressure 
[22]. As a result, metallicity and bulk superconductivity have been induced by the in-plane 
chemical pressure effect in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex.
The target material of this study is CeOBiS2 [27]. CeOBiS2 is a typical REOBiCh2-type
material. F-substituted CeO1-xFxBiS2 shows bulk superconductivity when the samples were 
annealed under high pressure [28]. In CeO1-xFxBiS2, superconductivity and ferromagnetism 
coexist [27-29]. Furthermore, CeOBiS2 has been investigated as a material located at a quantum 
critical point [30]. Notably, the parent phase CeOBiS2 shows metal-like conductivity and 


3
superconductivity at 1.3 K without carrier doping, and the Tc increases under high pressure [31,32]. 
This is inconsistent with the band calculations mentioned above. However, this metallicity in F-
free CeOBiS2 is most likely due to electron doping via mixed valence states of Ce ions [33]. 
Similar behavior has been observed in EuFBiS2 and Eu3Bi2S4F4 [34-36]. We consider that self-
doped BiCh2-based superconductor is a promising system for elucidating mechanisms of 
superconductivity because of less disorder in the blocking layers.
In this study, we synthesized a BiCh2-based superconductor system CeOBiS2-xSex (x = 
0–1.0) and investigated the crystal structural, transport, and magnetic properties. Metallic 
conductivity and bulk superconductivity were induced by Se substitution for x = 0.4 and 0.6.
2. Experimental
Polycrystalline samples of CeOBiS2-xSex with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0 were 
prepared by a solid-state reaction method. Powders of Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 were pre-synthesized by 
sintering a mixture of grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.999%) in an evacuated 
quartz tube at 700 ºC for 15 h. Powders of Ce2S3 (99.9%), CeO2 (99.99%), Bi2O3 (99.999%), 
Bi2S3, Bi2Se3 and Bi (99.999%) grains with a nominal composition of the target phases (x = 0–
1.0) were mixed, pressed into a pellet, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700 ºC 
for 5 h. The obtained sample was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated for 5 h at different 
temperature. Samples heated at 400 ºC were labelled S1 and samples heated at 700 ºC were 
labelled S2. S1 samples contained fewer impurities than S2 samples, but it was too fragile to 
measure electrical resistivity with four proves. Therefore, S1 was used for structural analysis, and 
S2 was used for electrical resistivity and magnetization measurements.
The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction method (XRD) with a Cu 
Kradiation (Rigaku, Miniflex-600) by the -2method. Synchrotron XRD experiments with λ 
= 0.495813(1) Å were performed using BL02B2 beamline at SPring-8 under the proposal of No. 
2019A1101.The experiment was performed with Multiple MYTHEN system [37] with a step of 
2θ = 0.006o. A crystal structure image was depicted using a VESTA software [38]. Structure 
parameters were obtained from Rietveld analysis using RIETAN-FP [39]. Electrical resistivity 
measurements were performed using the four-terminal method. For x = 0.2 and 1.0, the resistivity 
measurements were performed with a 3He system of Physical Property Measurement System 
(Quantum Design, PPMS) down to T = 0.5 K. The temperature dependence of magnetic 
susceptibility was measured by a superconducting interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with 
an applied field 10 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) using Magnetic 
Property Measurement System (Quantum Design, MPMS-3).

3. Results and Discussion
Figure 1(a) shows the XRD patterns for S2 samples (x = 0.0–1.0). The major phase can 
be indexed with the CeOBiS2-type tetragonal phase with the space group of P4/nmm, although 
minor diffraction peaks corresponding CeO2 impurity (< 5 wt%) were also observed. As shown 
in Fig. 1(b), XRD peaks systematically shift according to the Se concentration. Figure 2 shows 
the XRD patterns and the Rietveld fitting result for S1 sample (x = 0.6 as a representative sample). 
The small amount of CeO2 impurity phase (< 2 wt%) was detected. XRD data in Figs. 1 and 2 
show that the S1 and S2 samples are comparable except for the amount of impurities. Synchrotron 
XRD data was used for crystal structure analysis (Figs. 3 and 4).

analysis results for CeOBiS1.4Se0.6. The refinements were performed by two-phase analysis 
with a secondary phase of CeO2. The blue profile plotted at the bottom shows a residual 
curve between observed and calculated data. The inset shows the schematic representation 
of crystal structure for CeOBiS1.4Se0.6. Ch1 and Ch2 denote the in-plane and out-of-plane 
chalcogen sites, respectively.
Figure 3(a) shows the x dependences of the lattice parameters (a and c) and the lattice 
volume. Both the lattice parameters increase with increasing x, which can be understood by the 
difference in the ionic radius of Se2- (198 pm, assuming a coordination number of 6) and S2- (184 
pm, assuming a coordination number of 6). These elongations of the lattice parameters by Se 
substitution resemble those observed in LaOBiS2-xSex [40]. While Se ions dominantly occupy the 
in-plane Ch1 site, S ions occupy the out-of-plane Ch2 site. Thus, Se ions selectively occupy the 
in-plane Ch1 site, which is consistent with the observations in Se-doped REOBiCh2-type
compounds [26,40,41]. At x = 1.0, approximately 85% of Ch1 and 15% of Ch2 sites are occupied 
with Se, respectively. Figure 3(c) shows interatomic distances as a function of x. The Bi-Ch1 
(inter-plane), Ce-Ch2, and Bi-Ch1 (in-plane) distances increase with increasing x. The maximum 
change of interatomic distances by Se substitution (ΔRmax) is about 0.07 Å, 0.05 Å and 0.04 Å for 
those distances, respectively. The Ce-O distance is almost constant but slightly increases (ΔRmax
~ 0.008 Å). In contrast, the Bi-Ch2 distance decreases (ΔRmax ~ −0.03 Å). The position of Ch2 
with respect to the BiS2 layer plays an important role in the doping mechanism in EuFBiS2 [35].
Thus, the change in the Bi-Ch2 distance may be one of the important factors in this system as

well. 
In order to compare the amplitude of in-plane chemical pressure (CP) and physical 
properties in CeOBiS2-xSex, we have estimated in-plane chemical pressure amplitude parameter,
which is defined as CP = (RBi + RCh1) / (Bi-Ch1 in-plane distance), where RBi and RCh1 are the 
ionic radii of Bi and Ch1, respectively [22]. We assume that the valence of Bi is +3 and the RBi is 
1.03 Å. RCh1 is 1.84 and 1.98 Å for S2−and Se2−, respectively. We have estimated the Bi-Ch1 (in-
plane) distance using the structural parameters obtained from Rietveld refinement (Fig. 3(c)).
Figure 3(d) shows the x dependence of the in-plane CP for CeOBiS2-xSex. The CP increases with 
increasing x, and this trend of in-plane CP in CeOBiS2-xSex is almost the same as that observed in 
La(O,F)BiS2-xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex [22, 41,42]. 
Figure 3(e) shows the bond valence sum for the Ce site (Ce-BVS) plotted as a function 
of x. As demonstrated in Ref. 43 the Ce-BVS was calculated using the following parameters: b0
= 0.37 Å, R0 = 2.151 Å for Ce-O bond, 2.62 Å for Ce-S bond and 2.74 Å for Ce-Se bond. Bond 
distances between Ce and nine coordinating anions were determined by Rietveld refinement. Site
occupancies at the chalcogen site were included in the Ce-BVS calculation. The Ce-BVS tends to 
decrease with increasing x. This result suggests the mixed valence of Ce in CeOBiS2-xSex.
Qualitatively, in order to maintain electrical neutrality, the valence of the conductive layer should 
increase as the valence of the blocking layer decreases. Thus, the decrease of Ce valence implies 
reduction of the number of self-doped electrons in the conductive layer.
Figures 4(a) and (b) show x dependences of U11 and U33 for both the Bi and Ch1 sites.
For the anisotropic analysis of the displacement parameter U, the in-plane U11 and the out-of-
plane U33 were refined by Rietveld refinement. The U11 for the Ch1 site is clearly larger than that 
for Bi site for x = 0 and 0.2, and it decreases with increasing x. The origin of the large U11 for Ch1
has been suggested to be the presence of local in-plane disorder from extended X-ray absorption 
fine structure, X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction for several BiCh2-based system [3, 42, 
44-50]. The reduction of large U11 for Ch1 indicates that the in-plane local disorder was 
suppressed due to the in-plane CP. Recent studies have shown that the increase in the in-plane 
displacement of Ch1 would induce carrier localization and be negatively link to superconductivity 
[3]. Therefore, Se substituted samples with x > 0.2, which have less in-plane disorder, are 
expected to show bulk superconductivity in the CeOBiS2-xSex from structural point of view. On 
the U33 for Bi and Ch1 sites, U33 increases by Se substitution for both sites as displayed in Fig. 
4(b). This increase in U33 is probably related to the huge atomic vibration along the inter-layer 
direction which has been proposed for LaOBiS2-xSex. The anharmonic vibration of atoms in the 
in-plane site is enhanced by Se substitution in LaOBiS2-xSex [51].

Figures 5(a) and (b) show the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for x = 
0.0–1.0. For x = 0, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows slight increase with decreasing 
temperature, which is different from the previous work [27]. This difference in transport 
properties may be due to the local in-plane disorder. Furthermore, an anomaly was observed at 
90–180 K in the parent phase, in a similar manner as that observed in a previous work [28]. With 
increasing x, resistivity decreased, and metallic conductivity was observed for x = 0.6–1.0. The 
enhanced metallicity in Se-substituted samples should be due to the increase in in-plane chemical 
pressure. A superconducting transition was observed for x = 0.2-0.8. The highest onset 
temperature (Tconset) and the highest zero-resistivity temperature (Tczero) were 3.0 K (x = 0.6) and 
2.7 K (x = 0.4 and 0.6), respectively. Notably, the anomaly observed for x = 0 was suppressed in 
x = 0.2 and completely disappeared in x = 0.4. This result implies that the parent phase may have 
charge-density-wave (CDW)-like instability, which has been also proposed in EuFBiS2 [34]. In 
order to determine the cause of this anomaly, detailed crystal structure analysis using single 
crystals at low temperature may be needed.

Figure 6(a) shows the temperatures dependence of electrical resistivity under various 
magnetic fields for CeOBiS1.4Se0.6, which showed the highest Tc. Tc shifts towards the lower 
temperature side with increasing magnetic field. An upper critical field (Bc2)-temperature phase 
diagram is shown in Fig. 6(b). Bc2 are estimated at temperatures where the resistivity reaches 90% 
of normal-state values under various applied magnetic fields. We calculated Bc2(0) by the 
conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) model [52], which gives Bc2(0) = 
-0.693Tc(dBc2/dT) T Tc. Bc2(0) obtained from the WHH method is 1.15 T.

Figure 7 shows the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility below 5 K with 
an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe after ZFC for CeOBiS2-xSex. A large diamagnetic signal 
corresponding to superconductivity were observed for x = 0.4 and 0.6, indicating that the observed 
superconducting states are bulk in nature. For the samples with x = 0.2 and 0.8, no diamagnetic 
signal was observed down to 1.8 K, while those samples showed zero resistivity in the electrical 
resistivity measurement (Fig. 5(b)). Although measuring specific heat around Tc is one of the best 
ways to check the bulk nature of superconductivity, it is challenging to characterize a 
superconducting transition from specific heat because magnetic entropy of Ce 4f electrons should 
obscure the electronic specific heat jump at a superconducting transition [30]. The largest 
shielding volume fraction and the highest Tc of 3.0 K were obtained for x = 0.6, which is slightly 
higher than the one reported for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [53]. Regarding possible coexistence of 
ferromagnetism and superconductivity observed in the CeO1-xFxBiS2 system [27-29], our present 
results did not show any coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic ordering. 
On the basis of the measured results of electrical resistivity and magnetization, a
superconductivity phase diagram was established (Fig. 8); the Tc data for x = 0 was taken from 
Ref. 31 and plotted as well. Our results show that Se substitution suppresses carrier localization, 
described as “bad metal” in the phase diagram, and induces bulk superconductivity; this trend can 
be understood by in-plane chemical pressure effects. Then, Tc decreases and superconductivity 
phase disappears at higher Se concentrations. The suppression of superconductivity is probably 
linked to the decreased carrier concentration due to the decrease in Ce valence by Se substitution. 
From this work, we have obtained a bulk superconducting sample with less disorder in the 
blocking layer such as CeOBiS1.4Se0.6, which will be useful for experiments to probe mechanisms 
of superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds.

4. Conclusions
We have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system CeOBiS2-xSex, which 
shows a bulk superconductivity when local structural parameters and carrier concentration were 
both optimized by Se substitution. Polycrystalline samples of CeOBiS2-xSex with x = 0–1.0 were 
synthesized by the solid-state reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that in-
plane chemical pressure was enhanced, and the in-plane disorder was suppressed by Se 
substitution. BVS calculation showed that the valence of Ce ions decreased by Se substitution. 
For x = 0.4 and 0.6, a superconducting transition with a large shielding volume fraction was 
observed in magnetic susceptibility measurements, and the highest Tc was 3 K for x = 0.6. From 
electrical resistivity measurements, a zero-resistivity state was observed for x = 0.2-0.8, and the 
highest Tc was observed for x = 0.6. Since the CeOBiS1.4Se0.6 superconductor has less disorder in 
the CeO blocking layer owing to no substitution, this superconducting material should be useful 
for experiments to probe mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds.
