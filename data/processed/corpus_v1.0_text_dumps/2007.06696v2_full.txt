Abstract 
We report the sulfur isotope effect on transition temperature in a BiS2-based superconductor 
Bi4O4S3. Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared using 32S and 34S isotope chemicals. 
From magnetization analyses, the isotope exponent (S) was estimated as -0.1 < S < 0.1. 
Although the Tc estimated from electrical resistivity was scattered as compared to those estimated 
from the magnetization, we observed no clear correlation between Tc and the isotope mass. The 
present results suggest that unconventional paring states are essential in Bi4O4S3.

1. Introduction 
Superconducting pairing mechanisms in most superconductors are achieved by 
electron-phonon interactions and explained by the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory [1]. 
However, there are unconventional superconductors whose pairing is not mediated by phonon. 
The typical examples of unconventional superconductors are the layered cuprate and Fe-based 
high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [2,3], in which pairing is mediated by spin 
and/or orbital fluctuations [4,5]. Although there are various ways to test if the superconductivity 
mechanisms are mediated by phonon or other fluctuations, studying isotope effect on Tc is a direct 
probe to examine the importance of phonon to the superconductivity. Based on the conventional 
phonon-mediated model, Tc should be proportional to its phonon energy ħ, where ħ and  are 
the Planck constant and phonon frequency, respectively. The Tc of a conventional superconductor 
is, therefore, sensitive to the isotope effect of the constituent elements. The isotope exponent , 
which is defined by Tc ~ M- , where M is the isotope mass, is expected to be  ~ 0.5 from the 
conventional model [1]. For example,  close to 0.5 has been reported for a bismuth oxide 
(Ba,K)BiO3 (O ~ 0.5) [6], doped fullerene (C ~ 0.4) [7], MgB2 (B ~ 0.3) [8], and borocarbides 
(B ~ 0.3) [9]. In contrast,  different from 0.5 has been reported for unconventional 
superconductors. In the cuprate superconductor system, O deviates from 0.5 and exhibits 
anomalous carrier concentration dependence [10,11]. In the Fe-based superconductor, an inverse 
isotope effect, negative Fe, for the same composition [12]. 
In this study, we focus on the BiS2-based layered superconductors, which was 
discovered in 2012 [13-15]. Since the layered structure composed of alternate stacking of a 
conduction layer (BiS2 layer) and an insulator layer is quite similar to that of the high-Tc 
superconductors, elucidation of the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiS2-based 
superconductors has been desired; however, it is still controversial [16,17]. In the early stage, 
theoretical and experimental studies reported the possibility of conventional electron-phonon 
superconductivity in the BiS2-based compounds [18-21]. However, some of theoretical studies 
suggested the possibility of unconventional mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiS2-based 
system [22-24]. In addition, the possibility of unconventional mechanisms was experimentally 
suggested from angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 [25] and the Se-
isotope effect in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe (-0.04 < Se < 0.04) [26]. Therefore, further experimental 
investigations on the mechanisms are desired for the BiS2-based superconductor family. To 
investigate the S isotope effect on Tc, we selected Bi4O4S3 to be a target phase of this study because 
its Tc is relatively high (Tc > 4.5 K), the transition is relatively sharp, and the composition is the 
simplest (ternary) among the BiS2-based superconductors [13, 27-29]. Here, we show that the 
Bi4O4S3 superconductor samples prepared with 32S and 34S isotope chemicals did not show 
conventional-type isotope effect on Tc, and the estimated S was close to zero. This result proposes 


3 
 
that the unconventional isotope effect is universal feature between LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe with a BiSSe-
type superconducting layer and Bi4O4S3 with a BiS2-type superconducting layer. 
 
2. Experimental details 
Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared by a solid-state-reaction method. 
Powders of Bi (99.999%) and Bi2O3 (99.999%) were mixed with powders of 32S (ISOFLEX: 
99.99%) or 34S (ISOFLEX: 99.26%) with a nominal composition of Bi4O4S3. The mixed powder 
was pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 540 °C for 10 h. The obtained 
sample was examined by laboratory X-ray diffraction (XRD) by the θ-2θ method with a CuKα 
radiation on Miniflex600 (RIGAKU) equipped with a Dtex-Ultra semiconductor detector. Lattice 
constants were calculated by Rietveld fitting by RIETAN-FP [30]. The structural image was 
drawn by VESTA [31]. The temperature dependence of magnetization was measured by a 
superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) with an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe 
on MPMS-3 (Quantum Design). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was 
measured by a four-terminal method with an AC current of 1 mA on PPMS (Quantum Design). 
Au wires were attached on the sample surface by Ag paste. In this article, we have labeled the 
examined samples with the isotope mass (32 or 34) and alphabets (a–f) for clarity. 
 
3. Results and discussion 
We have synthesized polycrystalline samples at 540 °C because the reproducibility of 
the sample quality and the observed superconducting properties had been confirmed from 
experiments with natural sulfur chemical, while the obtained sample contained small amount of 
Bi2S3 and Bi impurities as indicated by + and * symbols as displayed in Fig. 1(a). Similar 
impurities were observed in previous reports on Bi4O4S3 [13,27,29]. Since the crystal structure is 
complicated, as shown in Fig. 1(b), and there is possibility of stacking fault and modification of 
the stacking in the ternary Bi-O-S system [32-34], we have tried to synthesize Bi4O4S3 isotope 
samples with close lattice constants to investigate the essential behavior on the isotope 
replacement between 32S and 34S. The lattice constants for the selected six samples are listed in 
Table I. 
 
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependences of magnetization for Bi4O4S3 samples with 
(a) 32S and (b) 34S. From the figure, the transition temperature in the magnetization data (TcM) 
looks almost the same. To evaluate TcM, temperature differential of magnetization (dM/dT) was 
calculated and plotted in Fig. 3. TcM was defined as a temperature where two linear fitting lines 
for the data just below and above the transition as shown in Fig. 3. The estimated TcM ranges from 
4.73 to 4.76 K for 32S and 34S samples. Interestingly, there was no clear correlation between TcM 
and the isotope mass in the magnetization data. The isotope exponent calculated from all the 


4 
 
possible combination of TcM is -0.1 < S < 0.1. 
 
Figure 4 shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity (ρ) for Bi4O4S3 
samples with (a) 32S and (b) 34S. Typically, a superconducting transition onset for Bi4O4S3 is quite 
broad and obviously higher than zero-resistivity temperature, which was explained as strong 
superconducting fluctuation [35]. Therefore, the onset temperature is not preferable to be used for 
the discussion of isotope effect. We hence estimated resistive Tc (Tcρ) as a midpoint of the 
transition; the definition is displayed in Fig. 4(a). Tcρ was defined as a temperature where ρ(T) 
becomes 50% of ρ(T = 5 K). As listed in Table I, Tcρ for 32S samples ranges from 4.53 to 4.66 K, 
and Tcρ for 34S samples ranges from 4.54 to 4.64 K. Although the Tcρ is relatively scattered as 
compared to the case of TcM, we could confirm that there is no clear correlation between Tcρ and 
the isotope mass.  
 
As mentioned above, the Bi-O-S phases have various structural forms including 
stacking fault [32-34]. Here, to avoid the possibility of the shift in Tc due to those structural 
differences, we compare two (32S and 34S) samples having similar lattice constants. Accordingly, 
from table I, the set of #32-c and #34-e were selected. For those two samples, the TcMs are the 
same (TcM = 4.73 K), and the Tcρs are 4.53 K for #32-c and 4.64 K for #34-e. If the conventional 
phonon-mediated mechanisms were essential in a superconductor with a Tc = 4.7 K, a difference 
in Tc of 0.14 K is expected between 32S and 34S isotopes. Therefore, the isotope effect seen from 
the comparison between #32-c and #34-e clearly deviates from the expectation from the 
conventional phonon-mediated superconductivity mechanisms. The present results show that the 
unconventional isotope effect is essential in Bi4O4S3 with 32S and 34S.  
Here, we briefly discuss about the commonality of the unconventional isotope effect in 
BiS2-based superconductors. As mentioned in above, a similar unconventional isotope effect was 
observed in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe with BiSSe-type superconducting layers [26]. Although the 
constituent element of the superconducting layer is different, the in-plane structural symmetry is 
common because both are crystallized in a tetragonal structure (P4/nmm for LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe and 
I4/mmm for Bi4O4S3). In addition, Tc is close; the typical Tc of LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe is 3.8 K. As well 
known, the BiS2-based compounds exhibit a pressure-induced structural transition, at which a 
jump (abrupt increase) in Tc is observed [36-37]. In the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, Tc increases from 
2 K (tetragonal P4/nmm) to 10 K (monoclinic (P21/m) by applying a pressure of 1 GPa [36]. 
Therefore, we can regard LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe and Bi4O4S3 with a tetragonal structure as a low-Tc 
phase of the BiS2-based superconductor from a viewpoint of in-plane structural symmetry, which 
is also a commonality between those two superconductors. To conclude what factor is essential 
for the emergence of unconventional pairing states in the BiS2-based superconductors, isotope 
effect and other studies for a high-Tc phase with a monoclinic phase is needed, and that is 
underway.

4. Conclusion 
We have reported the sulfur isotope effect on Tc in Bi4O4S3 with 32S and 34S. 
Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared by solid-state reaction using 32S and 34S isotope 
chemicals. To investigate the isotope effect, six samples having similar lattice constants were 
selected. From magnetization analyses, the isotope exponent was estimated as -0.1 < S < 0.1. 
Although the Tc estimated from electrical resistivity was scattered as compared to those estimated 
from the magnetization, we observed no clear correlation between Tc and the isotope mass. The 
present results on the isotope effect suggest Bi4O4S3 to be an unconventional superconductor.
