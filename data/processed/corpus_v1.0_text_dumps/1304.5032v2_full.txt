Graphical Abstract 
Up today, nanostructure engineering is the only one approach to obtain the large birefringence up 
to 1.0. Employed first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that LaOBiS2 has a giant inherent 
birefringence (negative), which absolute value is larger than 1.0 and about 4.5 times larger than 
that of YVO4 at about 600nm wavelength. Hence, the corresponding optical devices can be 
miniaturized in the scale shown in the Figure, i.e., LaOBiS2:YVO4:LiNbO3 is 1:4.5:12.5 for the 
same birefringence applications. While the two later crystals are commercially available, LaOBiS2 
is highly expected to be experimentally growth and nanostructure engineering.

Abstract 
Birefringent crystals (BFC) have been extensively used in imaging spectrometer, laser devices, and 
optical components. Seeking new BFC is of important for both fundamental research and industrial 
application. Employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we found that LaOBiS2 (space 
group P4/nmm), the parent phase of recently discovered BiS2-superconductor, exhibits superior 
birefringence with a maximum value of 2.94, which is 13.4 times larger than the extensively used 
YVO4 (0.22). Furthermore, LaOBiS2 is an indirect semiconductor with a band-gap of 0.9 eV, which is 
suitable for optical applications. The origin of giant inherent birefringence is discussed.

Layered compounds have received increasing attentions due to their excellent superconductivity,1 
thermoelectricity,2 giant magnetoresistance,3 and so on. They exhibit various electronic, optical and 
magnetic properties as well as good tunability. For example, the artificial layered-structures are 
designed for high-efficiency light-emitting diodes (LED)4 and optical communication5. Hosono et al. 
have explored novel layered oxides LaTMPnO, where a pnicogen anion (Pn3-) replaces a chalcogen 
anion (Ch2-) in LaCuOCh, a transition metal cation (TM
2+) can substitute for Cu+. There are many 
combinations (TM and Pn) to form 2-dimensional (2D) layered structure. Interestingly, the doped-F 
LaOFeAs is found to be a superconductor with Tc as large as 26 K. The discovery has received the 
world-wide attentions on iron-based superconductivity. The large number of other layered compounds 
is examined to reveal their superconductivity. Recently, a novel BiS2-based layered superconductor 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 (Tc~10.6K) is report.6 Its parent compound LaOBiS2 has LaFeAsO-type structure and is a 
semiconductor rather than a metal as LaOFeAs.7 More and more research is focused in the 
superconductivity. As we mentioned above, layered compounds have also various excellent properties. 
To demonstrate this, used LaOBiS2 as an example, we reveal a giant birefringence based on 
first-principles density function calculations. We also discussed the origin and proposed the promising 
potential applications.  
The calculations were performed using density functional theory with generalized gradient 
approximation (GGA) in the scheme of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof.8 The ion-electron interaction was 
modeled by PAW9 pseudopotentials in VASP.10 A plane-wave cutoff energy of 500 eV was employed 
throughout the calculation. For the sampling of the Brillouin zone, the electronic structures and optical 
properties used 12x12x6 and 18x18x9 Monkhorst-Pack11 k-point grids, respectively. Whenever 
possible, we cross–check the results using Quantum ESPRESSO package (QE).12 The consistency of 
our results for two sets of calculations is satisfactory. Employed DFT calculations, we have report the 
optical of ZnSnO3, where the maximum of birefringence is only 0.2 at 6.90 eV.13 In the following year, 
we found the giant optical anisotropy in the parent compounds of iron-based superconductors: 
LaFeAsO, BaFe2As2 and LiFeAs.14  
LaOBiS2 has a layered structure with space group P4/nmm (No. 129), as iron-based superconductor 
LaFeAsO. Its structure is composed of one La2O2 and two BiS2 layers (see, Fig. 1). Table I lists our 
calculated results on the structural parameters of LaOBiS2 as well as the corresponding experimental 
and theoretical values. Awana et al.7 have report the detailed structural parameters. It is clear that our 


 
 
4 
results are in good agreement with previous reports. Note that only S1 ions have large difference as 
compared to experimental report, similar theoretical results present in the case of LaFeAsO.  
The band structures along high-symmetry are depicted in Fig. 2. It is clear that LaOBiS2 is a 
semiconductor. The top of valence band locates at Г (or Z), while the bottom of conductor band at R (or 
X). Hence, an indirect gap of 0.90 is formed between Г and R (or Z and X), which is consistent with 
the VASP value of 0.7 eV [see Figure 5(b)].7 The GGA band-gap is usually underestimated. 
Unfortunately, there is no experimental value report so far. The following optical properties are 
calculated by PBE without scissors correction.  
Fig. 3 shows that the optical properties of LaOBiS2 have large anisotropy both in absorptions and 
refractive index. This is expected due to its layered-structure. For example, the infinite-layer iron oxide 
SrFeO2 has a giant optical anisotropy.17 Note that birefringence is the optical property of a material 
having a refractive index that depends on the polarization and propagation direction of light.18 It is 
quantified by the maximum difference in refractive index within the material. This effect was first 
described in calcite by the Danish scientist Rasmus Bartholin in 1669. There are three well-known 
natural materials that are birefringent in bulk form: calcite CaCO3 (δn=0.172), quartz SiO2 (δn=0.009), 
and magnesium ﬂuoride MgF2 (δn=0.006), all measured at a 590nm wavelength.18 Among artifical 
crystals, YVO4 has an excellent birefringence of about 0.22, which is inferior to rutile TiO2 (0.28). 
Owing to its easy growth, large index of refractivity and good mechanical properties, YVO4 crystals 
have been extensively used in laser devices and optical components.19 Whatever, seeking new 
birefringent crystals is of important for both fundamental research and industrial application, especially 
the device miniaturization.  
Now we check the birefringence of LaOBiS2. Surprisingly, we found that its birefringence is large as 
2.94 (the maximum), which is 13.4 times larger than that of the extensively used laser crystals YVO4 
(0.22). This is exciting. As you known that the birefringence of SrFeO2 is also only 0.2-0.5.17 To the 
best of our knowledge, the value is the largest among the inherent birefringence so far. In the range of 
[0, 0.8] eV bellow the band-gap value, the birefringence of LaOBiS2 is negative and its absolute value 
is larger than 1.0, which also at least 4.5 times larger than that of YVO4, the most important optical 
materials in optical communication. It is well-known that Nd:YVO4 crystals have been used to generate 
a radially polarized laser, because YVO4 has more than 3 times larger birefringence than that of 
LiNbO3 (0.08).20 Compared to LiNbO3, LaOBiS2 has 12.5 times larger birefringence, which can make

device design more compact. In this context, LaOBiS2 may have promising potential applications in 
semiconductor laser devices, optical communications and so on. For optical display, it can be used to 
improve grey-scale stability and contrast ratio, i.e., birefringent optical compensators are used to 
correct the polarization state of light entering and exiting the liquid crystal cell at oblique angles. In 
addition, owing to its semiconductor and large anisotropic conductivity (not shown here), LaOBiS2 
may have very promising potential applications in thermoelectricity and solar cells.  
Up today, it seems that nanostructure engineering is only one effective approach to obtain the larger 
birefringence, which is expected for practical applications. For example, giant birefringence is report in 
nanostructured silicon thin-film (0.3)21 and GaP nanowires (0.7).22 For the later, the birefringence is 
enhanced to be about 75 times larger than that of natural quartz crystal (0.009). Here, the birefringence 
of LaOBiS2, we report in this work, is 111 times larger than that of quartz crystal. Hence, its 
birefringence is giant. Recently, the in-plane birefringence of ZnO nanowire arrays is almost one order 
of magnitude higher than that of quartz.23 The Glancing Angle Deposition (GLAD)24 method has been 
demonstrated to be an effective method to obtain tunable birefringence in a large continuous range. For 
example, the in-plane birefringence (up to 0.4) of Si thin-films is large compared with naturally 
anisotropic crystals and is comparable to two-dimensional photonic crystals.25 In this context, the 
corresponding experimental investigation on the nanostructure engineering of LaOBiS2 is highly 
expected. Whatever, the giant birefringence of LaOBiS2 means that it is wonderful idea to study the 
other properties of layered-structure compounds, rather than only its superconductivity. Here, our 
results demonstrate DFT is an effective method for this issue.  
Why LaOBiS2 have a giant birefringence? To explain the reason, we calculated the birefringence of 
LaOZnP, a layered compound with the same space group structure (P4/nmm) of LaOBiS2. The results 
depicted in Fig. 4. While the negative maximum -1.10 is located at 2.57 eV, the positive maximum is 
1.26 at 3.64 eV. The corresponding maxima of LaOBiS2 are -2.14 (2.94) at 1.25 eV (3.66 eV), which 
are about 2 times larger than these of LaOZnP. For LaOZnP, its birefringence is only comparable to 
YVO4 (0.22). The comparison with LaOZnP indicates that the giant birefringence can not only result 
from the layered-structures, although the crystals with layered-structures are well-known to be 
birefringent.  
While LaOZnP is 1111-type compound, LaOBiS2 is 1112-type one. This means that S ions in LaOBiS2 
are 2 times than P ions in LaOZnP. Compared the structures of both compounds, we find that redundant 


 
 
6 
S ions are formed Bi-S bonds along z-axis, which enhance the optical anisotropy and birefringence. 
Why this 1112-type structures can exist，it is not easy to answer. The further investigation is highly 
expected. Whatever, we conjecture that the lone pair of Bi3+ ions may play an important role in this 
issue.  
In summery, we present first-principles calculations on the structural, electronic and optical properties 
of LaOBiS2. The structural parameters we obtained are in good agreement with previous theoretical 
values. Band structures reveal that it is an indirect semiconductor with a band-gap of 0.9 eV. There is 
large optical anisotropy due to its layered-structure. Interestingly, its inherent birefringence is found to 
be the largest among inorganic compounds as we known so far. The giant birefringence is attributed to 
its layered-structure and Bi3+ lone pair. Finally, LaOBiS2 is suggested have a very promising potential 
applications in laser devices, optical communications, thermoelectricity and solar cells.
