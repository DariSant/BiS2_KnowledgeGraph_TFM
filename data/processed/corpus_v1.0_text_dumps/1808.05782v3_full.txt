Abstract
  In 2012, we discovered superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 and LaO1-xFxBiS2, whose crystal structures are composed of 
alternate stacks of a BiS2-type conduction layer and a blocking layer. Since the discovery, many related superconductors and 
functional materials have been synthesized. Furthermore, the possibility of unconventional superconductivity has been 
proposed in recent theoretical and experimental studies. In addition, notable correlations between local structure and physical 
properties have been revealed in the BiS2-based systems. In this review article, we summarize the material development
(probably all the compounds) and physical properties of BiS2-related materials developed in the last six years. The key 
parameters for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the BiS2-based compounds are carrier doping to the parent phase 
(band insulator), pressure-induced structural transition, in-plane chemical pressure, and the suppression of in-plane disorder. 
We systematically review those parameters and the method of designing new superconductors with BiS2 layers. In addition, 
studies of BiS2-based compounds as thermoelectric materials are briefly reviewed.
1. Introduction
Since the discovery of Cu-oxide high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [1-4], various kinds of 
layered compounds have been synthesized with expectations of the discovery of high-Tc and/or unconventional 
superconductivity. Another layered high-Tc superconductor family is the Fe-based superconductors [5-10]. These high-Tc
superconductors have a layered structure composed of alternate stacks of a superconducting (SC) layer (CuO2 or FeAs layers) 
and an insulating (blocking: BL) layer. In such a layered superconductor family, new superconductors can be designed and 
synthesized by replacing the BL layer structure [11]. Owing to the richness of the structural variation and the exotic properties 
of the superconducting states, layered superconductors have been extensively studied in the fields of physics, chemistry, and
engineering.
In 2012, layered superconductors with a BiS2-type SC layer were discovered [12,13]. As the first member, the BiS2-
based compound Bi4O4S3 was reported [12]. The crystal structure of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor is composed of alternate 
stacks of the BiS2 SC layer (Bi2S4 bilayer) and the Bi4O4(SO4)0.5 BL layer [Fig. 1(a)]. The stacking of a SC layer and a BL
layer is similar to that of the Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors. By replacing the BL layer by a simpler REO layer (RE: 
rare earth), REO1-xFxBiS2 superconductors [Fig. 1(d)] were discovered [13-20]. Furthermore, BiS2-based superconductors 
with a BL layer different from the LaO layer have been synthesized, which will be introduced in detail in the next section. 
Recently, the various functionalities of thermoelectric, photocatalytic, and spintronics materials have been observed (or 
predicted) for layered chalcogenides related to the BiS2-based superconductors. Therefore, for the further development of the 
layered metal chalcogenide family as high-Tc and unconventional superconductors or promising functional materials, 
understanding the crystal structure and physical properties is crucial. 
In this review article, we summarize the material development of the BiS2-related layered compounds and their 
physical and chemical properties. First, material information from Refs. 12–219, categorized into properties shown in the 
paper, is summarized in Table I. On the basis of the table, the essence of the structural variation and the physical properties is
described. Furthermore, we try to systematically clarify the physical and chemical parameters essential for the emergence of

superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds. Particularly, the relationships among the crystal structure, electronic states, and 
physical properties are revealed. In addition, we show recent advances in the material design and clarification of 
superconductivity mechanisms in the BiS2-based systems.

Material Development
2.1 Bi-O-S phases
The field of BiS2-based superconductors and related compounds was opened with the discovery of superconductivity 
in Bi4O4S3 [12]. The discovery was serendipitous. When studying Bi-O-Cu-S, we removed Cu from the quaternary 
composition and observed superconducting signals in the ternary Bi-O-S compounds. By testing many compositions and 
annealing conditions (maybe over 150 conditions), we finally concluded that the bulk superconducting phase is Bi4O4S3.
From X-ray diffraction and structural analyses, the crystal structure was determined as that in Fig. 1(a). The crystal 
structure of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor is composed of alternate stacks of a BiS2 SC layer and the Bi4O4(SO4)0.5 BL layer. 
The space group of Bi4O4S3 is tetragonal I4/mmm (D4h17, No. 139). Band calculation suggested that the conduction band is 
mainly composed of Bi 6px and 6py orbitals hybridized with S 3p orbitals; hence, the BiS2 layer acts as a conducting layer. 
The electron carriers are generated by the SO4 defects: the valence states can be described as (Bi3+2O2-2)2(SO42-)0.5(Bi3+S2-2) 2
·e-, where e- denotes a doped electron. The temperature dependences of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility are shown in 
Fig. 2. Tc for Bi4O4S3 is 4–6 K (onset temperature exceeds 8 K) in the bulk, but the feature of a superconducting gap was 
observed up to 14 K by spectroscopy [21], which suggested the possibility of a higher Tc in this system.
Fig. 2. (Color online) Temperature dependences of (a) electrical resistivity and (b) magnetic susceptibility of Bi4O4S3. The 
original data was partly published in Ref. 12.
Bi3O2S3 is a sister compound of Bi4O4S3. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the BiS2 SC layer is alternately stacked with the 
Bi4O4S2 layer [28,34,160]. The space group of Bi3O3S2 is tetragonal I4/mmm. The valence states of Bi3O2S3 can be described 
as (Bi3+2O2-2)2S22-(Bi3+S2-2) 2. The Bi3O2S3 phase was suggested as a semimetal.
In the ternary Bi-O-S family, Bi2OS2 [36,37] has the simplest structure [Fig. 1(c)] similar to LaOBiS2. The space 
group of Bi2OS2 is tetragonal P4/nmm (D4h7, No. 129). Although the parent phase is a band insulator [95,154], a partial 
substitution of O by F generates electron carriers, and the doped phases BiO1-xFxBiS2 show superconductivity [35,37,40].


6
2.2 REOBiS2 type
Among the BiS2-based superconductors, the REOBiS2-based phases have been mostly studied owing to their simple 
structure [Fig. 1(d)] and easy carrier doping control. The first report on the superconductivity in the REOBiS2-based 
compound was for LaO1-xFxBiS2 [13]. The parent phase (x = 0) is a band insulator. F substitution makes the phase metallic, 
and superconductivity is observed in the doped phases. Later, we will explain in detail the carrier doping and crystal structure 
optimization for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the REOBiS2-based phases. Here, we summarize the variation 
of the REOBiS2-based superconductors.
The crystal structure of REOBiS2 is composed of BiS2 conducting layers and REO BL layers. Almost all the 
REOBiS2 and doped compounds have a tetragonal P4/nmm structure. Exceptionally, LaOBiS2 [161] and LaOBiS2-xSex [184 
and this paper] undergo a structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic P21/m (C2h2, No. 11) at around room temperature. 
As listed in Table I, electron doping in LaOBiS2 can be achieved by F- substitution for the O2- site or cation substitution (cation 
with a valence higher than 3+, such as Ti4+) for the La3+ site. In addition, by replacing La by Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, or Yb, various 
REOBiS2-based superconductors can be synthesized [14-17,20,126]. Also, the S site can be substituted by Se as displayed in 
Fig. 1(d) [62,79,159]. The doped Se tends to occupy the in-plane site in LaO1-xFxBiCh2 (Ch: S, Se) [133,141]. For the system 
with a small RE element, the synthesis of the parent phase (REOBiS2) is difficult. However, doped phases can be synthesized 
for RE = Sm and Yb. There is no report on the successful synthesis of REO1-xFxBiS2 with other RE.
For the REOBiS2 phases, single crystals were successfully grown [57,58,221]. The plate-like crystals can be easily 
exfoliated, which is due to the presence of a van der Waals gap between the BiS planes. The transport measurements with 
single crystals revealed a huge anisotropy of electronic conductivity and superconductivity (Hc2) in the BiS2-based compounds.
2.3 SrFBiS2 type
SrFBiS2 has a structure composed of BiS2 layers and SrF BL layers as shown in Fig. 1(e) [47]. The space group of 
SrFBiS2 is tetragonal P4/nmm. SrFBiS2 is also a band insulator. Carrier doping is achieved by substituting Sr2+ by RE3+. A
typical superconductor is Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 [51]. The basic physical and chemical properties of SrFBiS2 and doped phases are 
similar to those of REOBiS2-based systems. The Sr site can be replaced with Eu or Ca [120,182]. EuFBiS2 is one of the most 
exotic systems because it is metallic without element substitution and shows superconductivity at 0.3 K [120]. The metallic 
states of stoichiometric EuFBiS2 can be understood on the basis of the mixed valence state of Eu (+2.2–2.4) [120]. The S site 
can be substituted by Se [169,182,183,185,199]. In addition, a charge-density-wave-like (CDW-like) transition was observed 
in the temperature dependence of resistivity in EuFBiS2 [120]. The relationship between superconductivity and CDW 
instability is an issue that should be clarified.
2.4 Eu3F4Bi2S4 type
As displayed in Fig. 1(f), Eu3F4Bi2S4 has a BL layer (Eu3F4 layer) thicker than the REO and SrF layers [129]. The 
space group of Eu3F4Bi2S4 is tetragonal I4/mmm. Eu3F4Bi2S4 shows superconductivity at 1.5 K. The metallic nature of 
Eu3F4Bi2S4 is understood on the basis of the mixed valence state of Eu, similarly to EuFBiS2. In addition, the valence state of 
Eu in the Eu3F4 layer is very interesting. The valences of the inner and outer Eu sites are different. According to the different 
valence states, one of the Eu sites can be selectively replaced by Sr, resulting in Eu3-xSrxF4Bi2S4 [178,179].
2.5 REOMS2 type (M = Sb and In)
Since the BiS2 layer becomes a basic structure for layered superconductors, SbS2- and SbSe2-based compounds 


7
were also developed [213,215]. From theoretical calculations, SbCh2-based compounds are expected to be a Dirac system 
[107] or high-performance thermoelectric materials [110]. In addition, from the similar electronic structure to BiS2-based 
compounds, superconductivity can also be expected. As shown in Fig. 1(i), the REOSbCh2 phases can be obtained with the 
layered structure similar to REOBiCh2. However, at present, the obtained samples in polycrystalline and single-crystal forms 
are insulating. The insulating behavior can be related to the huge in-plane disorder, which will be explained later in detail with 
the BiS2-based systems. To induce the conducting nature expected from theoretical studies, further material development is 
required according to the chemical pressure concept. The space group of REOSbS2 is tetragonal P4/nmm for RE = Nd and 
Sm and monoclinic P21/m for La = La and Ce. For SbSe2-based compounds, the space group is tetragonal P4/nmm. Figure
1(i) depicts the tetragonal structure.
Miura et al. synthesized LaOInS2 [218]. The crystal structure is different from that of BiCh2- or SbCh2-based 
compounds. The In site was refined by the splitting model, which suggests a huge atomic displacement from the center 
position. The space group of LaOInS2 is orthorhombic P21/m (β was fixed as 90º). LaOInS2 is an insulator with a band gap of 
~2.5 eV and shows photocatalytic activity. In addition, the InS2 layer has no van der Waals gap, which is present in the BiCh2-
and BiSb2-based compounds. The difference may be explained by the absence/presence of lone pair electrons, 5s0 for In3+, 
6s2 for Bi3+, and 5s2 for Sb3+, in these compounds.
2.6 La2O2M4S6 type
Sun et al. synthesized the LaOBiPbS3 phase containing M4S6 conducting layers (M: Pb, Bi, Ag, and other metals)
and La2O2 BL layers [193]. As shown in Fig. 1(k), LaOBiPbS3 is composed of LaO layers and BiPbS3 layers. From 
synchrotron X-ray and neutron diffraction, we revealed that the BiPbS3 layer is ordered into Bi-rich and Pb-rich sites. 
Therefore, as described in Fig. 1(k), the structure can be regarded as stacks of LaOBiS2-type and rock-salt-type (PbS-type)
layers [194]. The space group of LaOBiPbS3 is tetragonal P4/nmm. From band calculations, LaOBiPbS3 was predicted to be
close to a zero-gap semiconductor (or metal), but the obtained sample shows insulating behavior at low temperatures.
According to the structural (stacking) concept in LaOBiPbS3, we synthesized La2O2Bi3AgS6 by replacing the PbS 
layer with the (Ag,Bi)S layer [205]. As shown in Fig. 1(l), the (Ag,Bi)S-type layer is inserted between LaOBiS2-type layers. 
Surprisingly, La2O2Bi3AgS6 shows metallic nature even at low temperatures and shows superconductivity at 0.5 K [214]. 
La2O2Bi3AgS6 also shows a CDW-like transition, which is similar to the case of EuFBiS2.
3.
Superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiCh2
3.1 Electron doping
As mentioned above, the parent phases of the BiS2-based superconductors are a band insulator. Since the conduction 
band of BiS2-based compounds is basically composed of Bi 6px and 6py orbitals hybridized with S 3p orbitals, electron doping 
is effective to induce a metallic nature. The typical of doping electrons in LaOBiS2 is the partial substitution of F- for the O2-
site. As shown in Fig. 3, electron carriers are generated in BiS2 layers owing to the compensation of the charge neutrality.
Electron carrier doping can be achieved by manipulating the BL layer of REOBiCh2. By substituting La3+ by M4+ (M = Th, 
Ti, Zr, and Hf), electron carriers can be generated in the BiS2 layers [52]. In addition, the mixed valence states of Ce can also 
be effective in generating electron carriers, which has been observed in CeOBiS2 and La1-xCexOBiSSe [171,196].

3.2 Carrier doping in LaO1-xFxBiS2
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity of LaOBiS2 and F-substituted LaO1-
xFxBiS2 [13]. LaOBiS2 shows semiconducting-like behavior: the resistivity increases with decreasing temperature. Although 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 also shows a slight increase in resistivity at low temperatures, the absolute value of resistivity for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is clearly lower than that of the parent phase. In LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, a superconducting transition is observed at 2.5 
K. Although a superconducting transition is observed in the resistivity, the shielding volume fraction estimated from the 
magnetic susceptibility is quite small for a bulk superconductor [Fig. 4(b)]. However, we observed a slight decrease in 
susceptibility from below 10 K, which was the indication of the presence of local phases with a higher Tc. To induce bulk 
superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, crystal structure modification by a high pressure (or chemical pressure) is required.

3.3 High-pressure annealing for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
Bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be induced by annealing the as-grown powder under high pressure
(HP) [13,50]. Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for as-grown and HP-annealed samples 
of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Surprisingly, Tc markedly increases to 10.6 K. In addition, the shielding volume fraction is markedly 


9
enhanced [Fig. 5(b)], which indicates the emergence of bulk superconductivity. Furthermore, the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample 
prepared by single-step HP synthesis showed the highest Tc of 11.5 K among the BiS2-based compounds [82]. The 
enhancement of Tc by HP annealing or synthesis is related to the introduction of strain in the grains. Actually, the X-ray 
diffraction peaks, particularly the 00l peaks, are broadened (with a shoulder structure in the high-angle side of the peak) after
HP annealing. The disorder (strain) was analyzed by pair distribution function UPDF) analysis [140]. From the PDF analysis, 
the intrinsic nature of in-plane structural fluctuations and the possibility of charge fluctuations linked to the superconductivity 
were proposed. However, the HP-annealed samples were not homogeneous because a certain degree of the pressure (strain) 
effect should be released after removing the pressure (after HP synthesis). Therefore, we examined the crystal structure 
evolution for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressure.

HP-annealed samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The original data was partly published in Ref. 13.
3.4 High-pressure effect
The high-Tc phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be obtained by applying HP to the as-grown sample [55,56,81]. Figure 6(a) 
shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (as-grown sample) under high pressure. The 
semiconducting-like behavior observed at ambient pressure is suppressed with increasing pressure. Suddenly, the high-Tc
phase appears at around 0.8 GPa. Figure 6(b) shows the pressure dependence of Tc for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. From the pressure 
phase diagram, it is clear that there is a critical pressure, which is related to a structural transition. From the X-ray diffraction 
under HP, a structural transition from tetragonal (P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P21/m) was revealed [81]. A schematic image of 
the structural change is shown in Fig. 6(c). To discuss the difference in local structure between tetragonal and monoclinic 
phases, we focus on the BiS square network (BiS plane). The BiS plane slides, and the interplane Bi-Bi distance becomes 
shorter, as if a Bi-Bi bonds were formed. Furthermore, in the monoclinic structure, the BiS plane can be regarded as Bi-S 
zigzag chains. This pressure study revealed that the two-dimensional Bi-S network is not required for the emergence of 
superconductivity, and the quasi-one-dimensional Bi-S zigzag chain can be superconducting with a higher Tc. The relationship 
between the square network and the zigzag chains in the BiS plane will be discussed with Fig. 11 later.


10
The monoclinic structure should be related to the disorder (strain) induced by the HP annealing or synthesis. 
Basically, BiS2-based compounds possess a structural instability [89], probably due to the presence of lone-pair electrons of 
Bi [155]. In addition, on the basis of temperature dependence measurements on local disorder for LaOBiS2-xSex [222], the 
structural instability can be considered as static structural disorder. This structural instability is a key concept to understand 
the emergence of superconductivity, which will be explained in Sect. 4.

3.5 Structural transition
The structural transition from tetragonal to monoclinic occurs in parent (non-electron-doped) phases such as 
LaOBiS2 and Se-substituted LaOBiS2-xSex. Sagayama et al. revealed that the low-temperature (below room temperature) 
structure of LaOBiS2 was monoclinic P21/m from single-crystal structural analysis with synchrotron X-rays [161]. From 
powder diffraction with synchrotron X-rays, the structural transition of LaOBiS2-xSex was also confirmed. (See Ref. 184 for 
x = 1.0 at 300 K. Other data at compositions and temperatures are presented in this article for the first time.) Basically, the 


11
electron-doped phases are tetragonal, and the phases with a small lattice parameter (a) tend to be crystalized in the tetragonal 
structure. Owing to the intrinsic structural instability, probably due to the presence of Bi lone-pair electrons and an interlayer 
misfit effect, BiS2-based compounds show structural flexibility with the tetragonal and monoclinic structures. This trend could
be an origin of the huge HP annealing effect in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2.

3.6 Carrier doping in NdO1-xFxBiS2
As introduced above, the emergence of bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2 requires the optimization of two
parameters. One of the important parameters is electron doping because the parent phase is basically an insulator with a band
gap. In addition, crystal structure optimization by the HP effects is required to induce bulk superconductivity. In contrast, 
NdO1-xFxBiS2 exhibits a simple superconductivity phase diagram against only the carrier doping amount. A comparison of the 
phase diagram between LaO1-xFxBiS2 and NdO1-xFxBiS2 is shown in Fig. 8. Although filamentary superconductivity is 
observed for LaO1-xFxBiS2 (as-grown), bulk superconductivity is observed in a wide range of carrier doping (x) for NdO1-
xFxBiS2. The difference between these two phases is the in-plane lattice parameter (a-axis). Since the ionic radius of Nd3+ (112 
pm) is smaller than that of La3+ (116 pm), assuming a coordination number of 8, the BiS2 layer is compressed in NdO1-xFxBiS2
owing to the shrinkage of the BL layer from La(O,F) to Nd(O,F). This is a kind of chemical pressure effect because both La3+
and Nd3+ are trivalent in this crystal structure; hence, the carrier doping amount is controlled by adjusting the F concentration 
(x) only. Motivated by this chemical pressure effect, we systematically investigated two systems with a tunable chemical 
pressure amplitude.

partly published in Refs. 17, 46, 50, 85, and 138. SC denotes superconductivity.
3.7 Chemical pressure effect
Chemical pressure (CP) is used for the lattice volume manipulation of materials using isovalent (partial or full-site) 
substitution. Using the CP effect, we can obtain effects similar to those obtained using the HP technique. The merit of the CP
effect is the great flexibility and precision of lattice volume tuning. In addition, we can avoid undesired disorder (or strain) 
effects, which sometimes occur in HP synthesis [13,140]. For the REOBiCh2 systems, two typical CP effects are powerful for
systematically changing the physical properties.
As mentioned earlier, RE-site substitution with RE3+ with a different ionic radius [Fig. 9(a)] is a powerful method.
The superconductivity phase diagram is shown in Fig. 9(c). Although the carrier doping (nominal x) is fixed as x = 0.5 (0.5 
electron per Bi), the superconducting property markedly changes with decreasing RE ionic radius from La to Sm [127,141]. 
Notably, the filamentary superconducting phase for RE = La (as-grown) is suppressed at RE = La0.5Ce0.5, and bulk 
superconductivity emerges at RE = Ce0.6Nd0.4. Tc increases with increasing CP.
The other CP effect is Se substitution for the in-plane S site [Fig. 9(b)]. In the REOBiCh2 structure, the S site can 
be systematically substituted by Se, and the Se ion preferentially occupies the in-plane Ch1 site [133,141]. As shown in Fig. 
9(d), bulk superconductivity is induced by the CP effect with Se substitution in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [128,141]. Interestingly, 
in the low-Se region, Tc decreases at x = 0.2 (the shielding fraction also decreases here), and bulk superconductivity is induced 
with further Se substitution. This trend is clearly similar to that observed in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 [Fig. 9(c)]. From the commonality 
in the CP phase diagrams, the link between CP, superconductivity, and local structure is suggested. To clarify the local structure 
changes and thier relation to the emergence of bulk superconductivity in this system, we performed synchrotron X-ray 
diffraction and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for these CP samples.

4.
Importance of Local Structure
4.1 In-plane chemical pressure
From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement, we discuss the correlation between crystal structure 
parameters and superconducting properties [see phase diagrams in Figs. 9(c) and 9(d)]. Since these phase diagrams exhibit 
similar trends as explained above, there should be common structural features in their CP effects. However, although we 
expected that the in-plane bond distance or the Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle (flatness of the BiCh1 plane) is essential for the emergence 
of superconductivity, there was no clear correlation. As shown in Figs. 10(a) and 10(b), the substitution of small RE in 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 results in lattice shrinkage. In contrast, the Se substitution in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex results in lattice expansion 
because the ionic radius of Se2- (198 pm) is larger than that of S2- (184 pm). However, the phase diagrams are similar. 
This contradiction can be solved by introducing the concept of in-plane CP amplitude. We estimated the in-plane 
bond length (Bi-Ch1 distance) and calculated the total of the Bi ionic radius and the Ch1 ionic radius (average). The in-plane 
CP amplitude parameter was defined as CP = (Bi-Ch1 distance) / (RBi + RCh), where RBi and RCh are the ionic radii of Bi and 
Ch in the Bi-Ch1 plane, respectively. (Please see original paper discussing the in-plane CP effect [141].) The estimated in-
plane CP amplitude is plotted in Fig. 10(d). Interestingly, in-plane CP increases by substitution for both systems. In Fig. 10(d), 
bulk superconductivity phases are indicated by a yellow region. Therefore, bulk superconductivity is induced at around the 


14
CP = 1.01 for both systems. Although the values of in-plane CP may not be directly related to the physical parameters, the CP
is useful for the qualitative understanding of the emergence of bulk superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2. In Fig. 10(c), a 
schematic image of the in-plane CP effect is displayed. For REO0.5F0.5BiS2, the BiS2 layer is compressed with decreasing a-
axis length by a smaller Nd substitution. Since the composition of the SC layer is not modified, the shrinkage of the Bi-S1 
distance directly enhances the in-plane CP amplitude. For LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, the composition of the La(O,F) layer does not 
change, but the Se concentration in the Bi-Ch1 plane is modified according to x. Basically, the bonding of the La(O,F) layer 
is stronger than that of the flexible BiCh2 layer. Therefore, the a-axis cannot expand significantly, even though the larger Se2-
ion filled the space of the two-dimensional network. This misfit strain effect generates a strong in-plane CP effect in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex.
Tc also shows a good correlation with the in-plane CP amplitude as shown in Fig. 11(a). With increasing CP, Tc
increases and approaches 6 K. However, the phase with RE = Sm is not a superconductor [126]. The estimated CP is close to 
that for RE = Ce, which is also non-superconducting. This should be due to the mixed valence states of Sm and a larger ionic 
radius.

plane (2D) CP amplitude (estimated using the equation described at the bottom) and (b) quasi-one-dimensional CP amplitude. 
The original data was partly published in Ref. 141. 2D and 1D denote two- and one-dimensional, respectively.
To relate the CP effects to the HP effects, the data for the HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is added into the phase diagram. 
The HP phase has a zigzag chain, and there are two different Bi-Ch1 distances. The shorter distance is the in-chain bond of 
2.72 Å, and the longer distance is the interchain bond of 3.03 Å. Assuming that the shorter bond is essential for the 
superconductivity, we plotted the quasi-one-dimensional CP phase diagram. Although there is only one data point for the HP 
phase, it seems to be located at the extension of the two-dimensional plots. A two-dimensional Bi-Ch network is not essentially 
for the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds. To increase Tc, a shorter Bi-Ch1 distance is required.
4.2 Suppression of in-plane disorder at the Ch1 site
So far, the importance of both carrier doping and the in-plane (or quasi-one-dimensional) CP effect has been 
introduced. However, the structural parameter directly linked to the emergence of bulk superconductivity should be identified. 
This was achieved by investigating the anisotropic atomic displacement parameters. For the anisotropic analysis of the 
displacement parameter U, the in-plane U11 and the out-of-plane U33 are refined by Rietveld refinement. As shown in Fig. 
12(a), U11 for S1 for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is clearly larger than U11 for Bi [206]. With decreasing RE ionic radius, U11 for S1 
decreases, and the bulk superconductivity is induced when the in-plane S1 disorder is suppressed. Similarly, Se substitution 
can suppress the in-plane disorder of the Ch1 site in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex [184]. In addition, from XAS, the suppression of in-
plane Bi-Ch1 disorder with increasing Se was detected [186]. The correlation between the CP effect and U11 for Ch1 can be 
understood from Fig. 12(c), which shows the carrier doping dependences of U11 for LaO1-xFxBiSSe. In LaO1-xFxBiSSe, the 
composition of the BiSSe layer is not modified, but the F concentration was systematically changed to increase the carrier 
doping. Since the BiSSe layer possesses a high amplitude of in-plane CP, the U11 values for Ch1 and Bi are small and 
comparable for all x. Namely, the carrier doping is not linked to the in-plane disorder. The evolutions of anisotropic 
displacement parameters are shown in Fig. 13. The in-plane U11 for the Ch1 site is clearly suppressed by the CP effects for 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex (with the crystal structures of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe).
Using the LaO1-xFxBiSSe system with less in-plane disorder, we can investigate the essential phase diagram for 
carrier doping and superconductivity for the BiCh2-based systems. Figure 12(d) shows the superconductivity phase diagram 


16
for LaO1-xFxBiSSe [184]. With a small amount of electron carriers, metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity are 
induced. The evolution of Tc shows an anomalous flat dependence on carrier concentration. This is consistent with the 
presence of correlation between Tc and the in-plane Bi-Ch1 bond distance. These trends suggest that the optimization of the 
crystal structure is very important for increasing Tc in the BiCh2-based superconductors.
Let us comment on the intrinsic structural disorder in BiS2-based compounds. As mentioned above, the intrinsic 
disorder is likely to be caused by the presence of Bi lone-pair electrons. This has been also observed for single crystals. Owing
to the intrinsic inhomogeneity and local breaking of symmetry, no NMR results on the superconductivity of this system have
been reported so far.

4.3 Possible relationship between atomic displacement of Bi and superconductivity
Let us briefly introduce the possibility of a positive correlation between superconductivity and disorder at the Bi 
site. From the pair density function analysis of neutron and X-ray data, Athauda et al. proposed the importance of charge
fluctuation for the superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiS2 [164,192]. Although the in-plane disorder of S1 is negatively linked to 
the superconductivity, that for the Bi site may be positively linked to the superconductivity. Powder X-ray diffraction and the 
analysis of the anisotropic displacements also suggest that there is a correlation between the Bi displacement and Tc [184,206].
Furthermore, the one-dimensional motion of Bi was revealed for the thermoelectric material LaOBiS2-xSex from neutron 
inelastic scattering [207]. This trend can be found in Fig. 13. U33 is still large for Ch1 and Bi sites when U11 is suppressed by 
the CP effects. The anharmonic motion of Bi may be related to the superconductivity in the BiCh2-based system.
5.
Studies Focusing on Pairing Mechanisms
5.1 Theoretical studies
The mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiS2-based superconductors have been extensively studied. Both 
conventional electron-phonon mechanisms [19,98] and unconventional mechanisms mediated by spin fluctuations, electron 
correlation, and spin-orbit coupling [91-93,101] have been proposed. Furthermore, recent theoretical calculations of Tc
suggested that conventional mechanisms mediated by phonons can achieve Tc higher than 0.5 K for the BiS2-based 
superconductors [104].
5.2 Spectroscopy
Since single crystals are available, particularly for REO1-xFxBiS2, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy 
(ARPES) studies have been performed [71,134,143,187,209]. On the actual Fermi surface (electron doping amount) in the 
crystals, good agreement between the theoretical calculation and ARPES studies was observed for RE = La [134]. However, 
for RE = Ce and Nd, the electron doping amount estimated from ARPES was much smaller than that expected from the
nominal F concentration and theoretical calculations [71,143]. Ota et al. observed the node of the superconducting gap in 
NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 [187] and proposed unconventional pairing mechanisms.


18
Using single crystals, scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) has been performed to analyze the
surface structure and the electronic states of BiS2-based compounds [58,75,158,200]. Machida et al. observed checkerboard-
stripe electronic states for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 [75]. On the surface, a semiconducting gap of about 20 meV was observed. Note 
that the surface is composed of single BiS2 layer only because the crystal is basically cleaved at the van der Waals gap between 
two BiS2 layers. Therefore, the semiconducting states may be the essential character of the surface of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 with a 
single BiS2 layer. These observations should be related to the CDW instability or other charge-ordering states. Liu et al. 
successfully observed a superconducting gap with STS for NdO1-xFxBi1-yS2 single crystals [58]. They also observed the 
opening of a semiconducting gap after cleaving. By removing surfaces using Ar mining, the superconducting gap was 
successfully observed. Notably, giant superconducting fluctuations were observed; the superconducting gap feature was 
observed even well above the bulk Tc.
5.3 Superfluid density
To discuss the pairing symmetry, investigation of the temperature dependence of the superfluid density in the 
superconducting states is useful. By muon-spin spectroscopy measurements (μSR), full-gap states were revealed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (HP-annealed) [63]. From the fitting of the temperature dependence of the superfluid density, the anisotropic 
s-wave was proposed. s-wave superconductivity was proposed from magnetic penetration depth measurements and also from 
the thermal conductivity measurement [30,163]. The contradiction between the nodal gap observed in ARPES and the fully
gapped states may be due to a disorder-induced topological change of the SC gap structure from a nodal s-wave to a nodeless 
s-wave [187]. In fact, the presence of defects in the BiS plane was proposed from STM. In addition, the BiS2-based system is 
an intrinsically disordered system as explained earlier. To conclude the universal pairing mechanisms in the BiS2-based 
superconductors, further measurements with various probes and integrated discussion are required.
5.4 Isotope effect
To discuss the importance of the electron-phonon interaction in the pairing mechanisms, the isotope effect is one of 
the powerful methods. If the pairing mechanisms are dominated by the electron-phonon interaction, Tc decreases with 
increasing mass of the isotope element. We used the LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe phase to test the isotope effect with 76Se and 80Se isotope 
chemicals. As explained above, the BiSSe layer can be regarded as less disordered, and essential superconducting properties 
can be discussed. In addition, superconducting transitions in resistivity and susceptibility are quite sharp for this composition. 
As a result, no isotope effect on Tc was observed for LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe with 76Se and 80Se [195]. The result suggests that 
phonons are not essential for the pairing in BiCh2-based superconductors.
6.
Thermoelectric Properties
Thermoelectric materials can directly convert waste heat to electricity and are considered as one of the promising 
technologies for solving energy problems. BiS2-based compounds show a relatively high performance (dimensionless figure-
of-merit ZT = S2T/κρ, where S, T, κ, and ρ are the Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, thermal conductivity, and 
electrical resistivity, respectively). The power factor (PF) is given by PF = S2/ρ, which is a parameter for the thermoelectric 
power amplitude for the compound. For LaOBiS2, PF markedly decreases with carrier doping owing to the decrease in S [84]. 
However, PF can be enhanced by Se substitution in LaOBiS2-xSex as shown in Fig. 14(a) [123,156,162]. This enhancement 
of PF can be understood with the concept of in-plane CP. With increasing CP, resistivity decreases [Fig. 14(b)] owing to the 


19
suppression of local disorder like in the case of superconductors. In addition, Se substitution does not decrease S2 because 
carrier concentration, which is directly linked to S in this system.
In addition, Se substitution supresses κ. LaOBiS2-xSex with x = 1.0 shows an extremely low κ of about 1 W/mK.
This κ value is lower than that of quartz glass or the typical thermoelectric compound Bi2Te3. κ is the sum of lattice thermal 
conductivity (κlattice) and carrier thermal conductivity. As shown in Fig. 14(c), Se substitution clearly suppresses κlattice. This is 
not caused by the randomness effect but by the enhancement of the anharmonicity by Se substitution. Figure 14(d) shows the 
temperature dependences of U11 and U33 for Bi [166]. U33 is clearly higher than U11. This anisotropic displacement is due to 
the presence of the rattling-like motion of Bi along the c-axis. Lee et al. reported the relationship between the phonon energy 
for Bi and the lattice thermal conductivity from neutron inelastic scattering study [207].
Ochi et al. theoretically predicted the possibility of a high ZT exceeding 2 for SbSe2-based or AsSe2-based systems 
[110]. As described in Sect. 2, REOSbSe2 was synthesized by Goto et al., but the obtained samples show insulating behavior. 
On the basis of the CP concept, we need to suppress the structural (disorder) problems to enhance PF. Since we have observed 
extremely low κ for REOSbSe2, the increase in PF should achieve an extremely high ZT.

7.  Summary
Since the discovery of superconductivity in the BiS2-based layered compounds Bi4O4S3 and LaO1-xFxBiS2, much
efforts have been made toward the material development and clarification of the mechanisms of superconductivity. In addition, 
for the BiS2-related compounds, the functional properties of thermoelectric, spin, optical, and photocatalytic materials have 
also been investigated in related compounds. As summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I, various types of crystal structure and 
compositions have been investigated.


20
The crystal structure of the BiS2-based compounds is composed of alternately stacked BiS2 conducting 
(superconducting) layers and blocking (insulating) layers such as LaO or EuF. The stacking structure is similar to those of the 
cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. A low-dimensional electronic structure is realized, and the electronic and structural 
properties can be easily manipulated by element substitution and/or pressure effects, which is the merit of layered systems.
The parent phase of BiS2-based superconductors is an insulator with a band gap. Since the conduction band is 
composed of Bi 6p orbitals hybridized with S 3p, electron doping is required to obtain a metallic character. For example, 
electron-doped LaO1-xFxBiS2 shows superconductivity, but the superconducting states for the as-grown sample of LaO1-
xFxBiS2 are not bulk in nature. To induce bulk superconductivity, the optimization of the local crystal structure is important. 
High pressure can stabilize the monoclinic structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 and induces bulk superconductivity. In addition, the 
chemical pressure effect by RE substitution or Se substitution can also induce bulk superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiCh2. The 
in-plane chemical pressure is universally essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the BiS2-based systems. 
The in-plane chemical pressure suppresses the in-plane disorder of S atoms, which intrinsically exists in the BiS2-based 
compounds. Now, we know a method of inducing bulk superconductivity by carrier doping and structural optimization. 
Therefore, the next stage is the complete understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family. 
There are still contradictory results on the mechanisms. Further measurements on well-designed compositions with various 
probes and integrated discussion are required. Finally, let us mention the possibility of a higher Tc in the BiS2-based systems. 
As shown in Fig. 4(b), small signals with a higher Tc (higher than the bulk Tc) have been observed in some compounds. In 
addition, as reported by Liu et al., giant superconducting fluctuations were observed from STS. Therefore, further material 
development is required. We believe that a high Tc can be obtained by realizing the optimized condition (possibly extremely 
compressed local Bi-S bonding).
Acknowledgments
The author would like to thank all the collaborators and researchers studying BiS2-based and related compounds for their 
encouragement to study this new field. In particular, the author thanks his former and current group members, H. Izawa, J.

for their support; their unpublished data are partly shown in this review paper. The main results on BiS2-based systems 
presented in this review article were obtained under the supports of Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) (Nos.
23860042, 25707031, 26600077, 15H05886, 16H04493, and 17K19058), JST-CREST (No. JPMJCR16Q6), and the bilateral 
agreement between Tokyo Metropolitan University and Sapienza University of Rome. The crystal structure analysis of 
LaOBiS2-xSex was performed at BL02B2, SPring-8 (proposal no.: 2016B1078).
Note
This review article is part of a special issue on BiS2-related compounds and aimed to be useful as an introductory review 
for the other review articles in the same issue. We hope that readers find interesting characteristics and recent advances of this 
system from the other review articles with specialized topics. Since the discovery of the superconductivity of BiS2-based 
superconductors, we have continued to upload the reference information of articles that appeared in arXiv and journals to the 
website “Papers on BiS2-based superconductors (http://www.comp.tmu.ac.jp/eeesuper/BiS2_papers.html)”. We will be happy 
if this database is useful for your future works.
