Abstract 
 We succeed in enhancement of a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) for 
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystal by partial substitution of Pb for Bi. The Tc increases with 
increasing Pb concentration until 6%. The maximum Tc
zero is 5.6 K, which is the highest value 
among BiS2 based superconductors synthesized under an ambient pressure. Pb substitution for 
Bi induces lattice shrinkage along the c axis. These results reflect that superconductivity in 
this system is responsive to the lattice strain.

Introduction 
High temperature superconductivity is the one of the most interesting phenomena in 
solid state physics. This phenomenon has been achieved in cuprates and iron-based 
superconductors [1-13]. One of the common features in these materials is the layered structure 
composed of block layers and conduction layers. This structure leads to two dimensional 
conduction, which is intrinsic to unconventional superconducting mechanism. This structure 
also contribute to the carrier doping which is needed to realize superconductivity: the block 
layers supply carriers into the conduction layers without introducing structural disorder of the 
conduction layers.  
 
Recently, BiS2 based superconductors has been discovered [14,15]. These 
superconductors have the similar layered structure to cuprates and iron-based superconductors. 
So, this material is possible candidate for another high temperature superconductor. Up to now, 
many members of BiS2 superconductors have been reported [16-26]. Among them, NdOBiS2 
shows superconductivity when a part of O2- ions are partly substituted F- ions [16]. The Tc 
changes by the control of the F concentration and becomes the maximum value of 5.2K at the 
F concentration of 40 %. This Tc is the highest value among BiS2 based superconductors 
synthesized in an ambient pressure. Interestingly, the Tc increases up to around 6.5 K when 
the samples are measured under a high pressure [27]. This increase of Tc is common 
properties in BiS2 compounds with the block layers of LnO (Ln=La, Pr, Ce, Nd) [28-36].

Furthermore, a theoretical study for La(O,F)BiS2 using a first principle band calculation 
indicated that the distance between La and S outside of the BiS2 layer significantly affects the 
electronic structure [37]. These results may imply that the properties of BiS2 superconductors 
are quite sensitive for a lattice strain. Considering these facts, it is interesting to induce the 
lattice strain into the compounds by a partial substitution of atoms to investigate the relation 
between Tc and the lattice strain. 
       In this study, we report an increase of Tc for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 single crystals by partial 
substitution of Pb for Bi. The ionic radius of Pb ion is larger than that of Bi ion. Therefore, a 
strain can be introduced to the crystal structure in an ambient pressure when Pb ions are 
substituted for Bi ions. These single crystals were synthesized by a flux method in quarts 
tubes. A c axis significantly decreases with increasing Pb concentration up to 6% while a a 
axis gradually increases. The Tc of these crystals increases with increasing Pb concentration 
until 6 %. A maximum value of Tc
zero is 5.6 K, which is the highest value among those of BiS2 
superconductors synthesized in an ambient pressure. These facts suggest that superconducting 
properties are responsible to the lattice strain. 
 
Experimental 
    Single crystal samples of NdO0.7F0.3Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0.01-0.1) were prepared by a CsCl 
flux method in vacuumed quarts tubes [38,39]. Mixtures of Bi (Mituswa Chemicals Co. Ltd., 


 
5
99.9%), Bi2S3, Bi2O3 (Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd., 99.99%), BiF3 (Stella 
Chemifa Co. Ltd., 99%), Nd2S3 (Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd., 99%), and PbO 
(Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd., 99.9%) were ground with nominal compositions of 
NdO0.7F0.3Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0.01-0.1). Bi2S3 was obtained by sintering the mixtures of Bi and S 
(Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory Co. Ltd., 99.99%) in the evacuated quartz tube at 500 °C for 
10 hours. The mixture of 0.8 g was mixed with CsCl powder (Kojyundo Chemical Laboratory 
Co. Ltd., 99.9%) of 5 g, and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was heated at 
800 °C for 10 hours and cooled down to 630 °C at a rate of 0.5 or 1.0 °C/h. After this thermal 
process, the sintered materials were washed by distilled water to remove the flux. The 
obtained single crystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction measurements with Cu-K 
radiation using the -2 method. The surface structure of single crystals was observed by a 
laboratory-build scanning tunneling microscope (STM) at 4 K. The temperature dependence 
of magnetic susceptibility was measured by a superconducting quantum interface device 
(SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 10 Oe. The field was applied parallel to the c 
axis of the sample. Tc
mag is defined as the crossing point of fitting lines for the magnetic 
susceptibility in the normal state near the transition and the line in the drop area during the 
transition. The resistivity measurements were performed using the four-terminal method from 
2 to 300 K. The Tc
onset is defined as a crossing point of fitting lines for resistivity in the normal 
state near the transition and the line in the drop area during the transition. The Tc
zero is defined 


 
6
as the temperature where resistivity becomes zero. 
 
Results 
      Figure 1(a) shows X-ray diffraction profiles for the single crystal samples of 
NdO0.7F0.3Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0.01-0.10), respectively. The bottom profile shows (00l) peaks of 
NdOBiS2 as reference. All of the peaks are corresponded to the (00l) peaks of CeOBiS2 type 
structure with the space group P4/nmm symmetry. Enlarged (004) peaks are shown in 
Fig.1(b). These peaks gradually shift to higher angle with increasing Pb concentration. 
Figure 2(a) exhibits c axis of Pb doped samples. The c axis significantly decreases with 
increasing Pb concentration until x=0.06, and become almost constant up to x=0.10. The a 
axis was estimated by X-ray diffraction using the powder prepared by grinding the single 
crystals. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the a axis gradually increases with increasing Pb 
concentration up to x=0.10. The monotonic change in the a axis guarantees the partial 
substitution of Pb for Bi in this x range. 
       We also observed the cleaved sample surface by STM technique. Figure 3 shows a 
STM image of NdO0.7F0.3Bi0.96Pb0.04S2 single crystal. The observed surface shows a square 
lattice with a lattice constant of 3.9 Å, which corresponds to the lattice constant a. No 
indication of Pb segregation or phase separation was observed. The observed atoms are 
thought to be Bi atoms on the topmost BiS2 layer as in the case of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 [40]. The 


 
7
number of dark spots, which indicate Bi defect, was about 4%. This concentration of the 
defect is the almost same as previous report in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 [40]. Thus, the number of 
defects is not affected by the Pb substitution.  
     Figure 4(a) exhibits temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility for 
NdO0.7F0.3Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0.01-0.10) single crystals. Large diamagnetic signal corresponds to 
superconductivity can be seen for all Pb doped samples. To determine these superconducting 
transition temperatures (Tc), the magnetic susceptibility near the Tc is shown in Fig. 4(b). 
The Tc increases with increasing Pb concentration until x=0.06, and decreases at x=0.10. The 
highest Tc 
mag is 5.6 K.  
   The temperature dependence of resistivity for all Pb doped samples is presented in 
Fig. 5(a). All samples show the sharp superconducting transition and zero resistivity around 
6K, which is correspond to superconducting transition. The resistivity near the Tc is 
exhibited in Fig. 5(b). The Tc
onset and Tc
zero increase with increasing Pb concentration until 
x=0.06, and decrease at x=0.10. The maximum Tc
zero is 5.6 K at x=0.06, which is the highest 
value among the BiS2-based superconductors synthesized under an ambient pressure.  
In order to discuss the temperature dependence of resistivity, we fit the resistivity 
data to the formula: 
   
      
where    and A, n is fitting parameters. These fitting lines are drown as the gray lines in 


 
8
the Fig. 5(a) and fitting parameters are shown in a table 1. The resistivity of samples with 
x=0.02 and 0.04 can be fitted to the formula from 300 K down to 80 K, and shows a slight 
upturn below 80 K. For the samples with x=0.06 and 0.10, the fitting region goes down to 
20 K. Namely, these sample shows the more metallic behavior than the samples with 
x=0.02 and 0.04. This result implies that the upturn of resistivity is suppressed by Pb 
doping.  
The resistivity at the room temperature for each Pb doped sample increases with 
increasing Pb concentration until x=0.06. This change in resistivity mainly comes from the 
change in   . Because Pb substitution of Bi in BiS2 layer, which is the conduction layer, 
may increases the disorder of the conduction plane, residual resistivity    seems to 
increase with Pb doping. However, parameter A also increases at x=0.06. The increase in A 
cannot be explained by the disorder. This indicates that the Pb doping induces not only as 
enhancement of the disorder but also modification of the electronic structure through the 
change in the lattice parameter. It is noted that the resistivity at the room temperature 
slightly decreases when the amount of Pb is x=0.10. This also shows that the effect of the 
Pb doping is not only the enhancement of the disorder. 
        Figure 6 shows a Pb concentration dependence of Tc obtained by each 
measurement. All Tc gradually increase with increasing Pb concentration until x=0.06. This 
result indicates that superconductivity is obviously enhanced by the Pb doping. Now, let’s 


 
9
consider a relation between Pb doping and the enhancement of Tc. Following two effects are 
expected by Pb doping. One is the change of the carrier number. A valence of Pb ion is 
typically Pb2+. This valence is one electron fewer than that of Bi3+. This means that carriers 
are taken from the compound by Pb doping. Thus, the enhancement of Tc may due to the 
change in the carrier number. However, this is not the case. In the previous study, the carrier 
number dependence on Tc was reported in NdO1-xFxBiS2, where the carrier number was 
controlled by the amount of F- concentration substituted for O2-. In that study, the maximum 
Tc was achieved at the F concentration of x=0.4 [16]. Thus, to obtain the maximum Tc by 
carrier doping into NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, it needs 0.1 electron per Bi ion doping into the sample. 
On the other hand, Pb doping introduces the hole carriers into the sample. This should 
decrease Tc. Therefore, the enhancement of Tc is not due to the carrier doping. Furthermore, 
the observed maximum Tc in Pb doped sample is higher than that of NdO1-xFxBiS2. Thus, the 
observed enhancement of Tc cannot be explained by the change in the carrier number. 
The other effect of the Pb doping is the change in the lattice constant. Ionic radius of 
Pb2+ ion is larger than that of Bi3+ ion. Thus, the crystal is slightly strained by doping Pb ions. 
As shown in Fig. 2, the lattice constant a and c changes depending on the amount of doped 
Pb. This effect may be related to the enhancement of Tc. Actually, many papers have 
revealed that Tc of BiS2 based superconductors with LnOBiS2 type structure increases under 
the high-pressure where the lattice constant decreases [27-36]. Theoretical study also 


 
10
reported that the band structure of BiS2-based materials is sensitive to the lattice constant 
along the c axis [37,41,42].  Thus, it is plausible that the Tc enhancement with Pb doping is 
achieved by shrinkage along the c axis. In this scenario, the saturation of Tc at x=0.1 is 
consistent with the saturation of the lattice constant c as shown in Fig.2 (b). 
 
Summary 
       We achieved the increase of Tc by the Pb substitution of Bi in NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The 
enhancement of Tc is attributed the change in the lattice contraction along the c axis. The Tc
zero 
increases with decreasing c axis, and becomes the maximum value around 5.6 K at the Pb 
concentration of 6 %, which is the highest value among BiS2 based superconductors 
synthesized under the ambient pressure. These results indicate that superconductivity in this 
material is strongly associated with the lattice strain.
