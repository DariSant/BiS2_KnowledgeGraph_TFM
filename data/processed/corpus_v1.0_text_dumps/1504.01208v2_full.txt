Abstract 
 
BiCh2-based superconductors (Ch: S, Se) are a new series of layered 
superconductor. However, mechanisms for the emergence of superconductivity in 
BiCh2-based superconductors have not been clarified. In this study, we have 
investigated crystal structure of two series of optimally-doped BiCh2-based 
superconductors, 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, 
using 
powder 
synchrotron x-ray diffraction in order to reveal the relationship between crystal 
structure and superconducting properties of the BiCh2-based family. We have found that 
an enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure would commonly induce bulk 
superconductivity 
in 
both 
systems. 
Furthermore, 
we 
have 
revealed 
that 
superconducting transition temperature for REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors could 
universally be determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure.

Most of superconductors with a high transition temperature (Tc) possess a 
layered crystal structure. Typical examples of layered high-Tc superconductor are 
Cu-oxide [1] and Fe-based superconductors [2]. They have a crystal structure composed 
of an alternate stacking of superconducting layers (CuO2 or FeAs layers) and spacer 
layers. The spacer layers are electrically insulating and essential for the emergence of 
low-dimensional electronic states within the superconducting layers, which is 
sometimes responsible for the emergence of unconventional paring mechanisms. One of 
the attractive features of those layered superconductors is a wide variation of crystal 
structure. Various kinds of new superconductors can be designed by stacking common 
superconducting layers and various types of spacer layers, and their superconducting 
properties depend on types of the spacer layers. In fact, many Fe-based superconductors 
with various types of spacer layer have been discovered, and high Tc was achieved in 
several Fe-based superconductors [2-8]. 
 
With a wide variation of related layered superconductors with various 
structures and properties, one can extract a crystal structure parameter essential for 
the emergence of superconductivity in the layered family. In the Fe-based family, it was 
found that Tc can be estimated by a crystal structure parameter such as an As-Fe-As 
bond angle [9] or an anion height from Fe square lattice (anion = As, P, Se, and Te) [10]. 
Changes in those parameters strongly affect configurations of Fermi surfaces and 
paring symmetry, and superconducting properties of Fe-based superconductors [11]. In 
fact, clarification of a crystal structure correlating with superconducting properties is 
one of the most important challenges for understanding the mechanisms of 
superconductivity in a new series of layered superconductor. In addition, it gives a 
direct strategy for designing new layered superconductors with a higher Tc. 
 In 2012, we reported the discovery of novel layered superconductors with a crystal 
structure composed of an alternate stacking of common BiS2 superconducting layers 
and various spacer layers [12,13]. Band calculations suggested that the parent phase of 
BiS2-based superconductors is an insulator with Bi3+. Superconductivity is induced 
when electron carriers are doped into the BiS2 layers (within Bi-6p orbitals) by element 
substitution at the spacer layers [12,14]. For example, a parent compound REOBiS2 
becomes a superconductor by a partial substitution of O at the spacer layers by F 
(namely, REO1-xFxBiS2) [13]. So far, 12 kinds of parent compounds of BiS2-based 
superconductor have been discovered: REOBiS2 (RE = La [13], Ce [15], Pr [16], Nd [17], 
Sm [18], Yb [19], and Bi [20,21]), AFBiS2 (A = Sr [22,23], Eu [24]), Bi6O8S5 [12], Bi3O2S3 
[25], and Eu3F4Bi2S4 [26]. In addition, superconductivity was observed in a BiSe2-based 
compound LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 as well [27]. Therefore, exploration for new BiCh2-based (Ch: 


3 
 
S, Se) layered superconductors and studies with an aim to elucidate the mechanisms of 
superconductivity in the BiCh2 layered compounds have attracted researchers in the 
field of condensed matter physics. 
 
As mentioned above, electron-carrier doping is needed for the emergence of 
superconductivity in the BiCh2 family. On the other front, some reports have suggested 
that optimization of crystal structure is also important for the emergence of 
superconductivity in the BiCh2 family. One of those is a high pressure (HP) effect on Tc. 
For example, LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows dramatic changes in superconductivity under HP. 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not show bulk superconductivity while it shows a filamentary 
(weak) superconductivity signal with a Tc of 2.5 K [13]. With applying HP, 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 becomes a bulk superconductor and Tc largely increases from 2.5 K to 
over 10 K [13,28-32]. In addition, an enhancement of Tc under HP was observed in other 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors as well [32]. These facts strongly suggest that 
superconducting properties of BiCh2-based superconductors are correlated with changes 
in crystal structure as revealed in the Fe-based family [9,10].  
 
Furthermore, our recent studies on isovalent-substitution effects to 
superconductivity have suggested that optimization of crystal structure is important for 
the emergence of bulk superconductivity and a higher Tc in optimally-doped 
REO0.5F0.5BiCh2. One of the examples is Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 [33]. Since valence of Ce 
and Nd are basically 3+ in this crystal structure, electron carriers in these compounds 
are essentially the same: a formal valence of Bi is 2.5+. However, bulk 
superconductivity is induced by a systematic substitution of Ce by Nd, and Tc increased 
with increasing Nd concentration (x) as shown in Fig. 1a. The emergence of 
superconductivity was explained by uniaxial lattice shrinkage along the a-axis and 
optimization of a lattice shrinkage ratio c / a [33]. The other example of the 
isovalent-substitution systems is LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 [34]. In LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, 
the S2- site within the superconducting layers is systematically substituted by Se2-. 
Therefore, the formal valence of Bi2.5+ should not be changed by Se substitution. Bulk 
superconductivity is induced by Se substitution, and Tc increases with increasing Se 
concentration (y) as shown in Fig. 1b. In this system, Se substitution enhances metallic 
conductivity, and bulk superconductivity is induced by an expansion of lattice volume by 
Se substitution [34]. 
 
On the basis of these experimental facts in HP studies on REO0.5F0.5BiS2 
[13,28-32] 
and 
isovalent-substitution 
studies 
on 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 [33,34], there is no doubt that superconducting properties of the 
BiCh2 family correlate with not only electron carrier concentration but also their crystal 


4 
 
structure. However, universal relationship between crystal structure and the 
emergence of superconductivity (and their Tc) in the BiCh2 family has not been clarified 
yet. In this study, we aim to clarify a crystal structure which directly correlates with the 
emergence of superconductivity and Tc of the BiCh2 family. Fortunately, we have two 
isovalent-substitution systems of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, which 
exhibit a similar superconductivity phase diagram to each other as shown in Fig. 1. In 
order to discuss the changes in crystal structure parameters and their relationship to 
superconductivity, we have performed powder synchrotron x-ray diffraction (XRD) and 
Rietveld refinement for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. 
 
Here, we show that an enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure within the 
superconducting Bi-Ch plane would be a crystal structure parameter, which commonly 
explain 
the 
emergence 
of 
superconductivity 
in 
REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 
compounds. 
Furthermore, we show that Tc for REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors could universally be 
determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure. 
  
 
Results 
Evolution of crystal structure parameters.  
 
We have performed powder synchrotron XRD for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 and performed Rietveld refinement. Typical Rietveld refinement 
profiles for x = 0.6 and y = 0.5 are displayed in supplementary information (Figure S1). 
Although tiny impurity phases of RE fluorides were detected, all the XRD peaks of the 
main phase were refined using a tetragonal P4/nmm space group. Obtained crystal 
structure parameters are plotted as a function of x (or y) in Fig. 2: the crystal structure 
data are listed in supplementary information (Table S2). In Fig. 2, the data points for 
the samples showing bulk superconductivity (Bulk SC) are highlighted with 
orange-filled circles. If a crystal structure parameter for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 changed similarly to each other, the crystal structure parameter 
should be essential for the emergence of superconductivity in these series because these 
two series exhibit a similar superconductivity phase diagram as a function of x or y as 
introduced in Fig. 1. 
 
Figure 2a and 2b show the x (or y) dependences of lattice constants of a and c 
for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, respectively. In Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
both lattice constants decrease with increasing x due to an increase in concentration of 
Nd3+ (112 pm, assuming coordination number of 8), which is smaller than Ce3+ (114 pm). 
In contrast, both lattice constants increase with increasing y in LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 


5 
 
due to an increase in concentration of Se2- (198 pm, assuming coordination number of 6), 
which is larger than S2- (184 pm). These contrasting changes in lattice constants 
suggest that the evolution of superconductivity in these two series cannot be explained 
by a simple lattice contraction or expansion. 
 
Figure 2c shows the x (or y) dependences of Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle for 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. The Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle is an indicator of 
flatness of Bi-Ch1 plane. Since electrons within the Bi-6p orbitals hybridized with the 
Ch-p orbitals (S-3p or Se-4p) are essential for the emergence of superconductivity in 
BiCh2-based superconductors, a flatter Bi-Ch1 plane simply seems to be better for the 
emergence of bulk superconductivity with a higher Tc. In fact, a previous study on 
crystal structure of CeO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals with different F concentrations 
indicated that a flatter Bi-S1 plane resulted in higher superconducting properties [35]. 
In Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, the Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle approaches 180 degree with increasing x, 
indicating that the Bi-S1 plane becomes flatter, and superconductivity is induced with 
Nd substitution. However, the Se concentration dependence of Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle for 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 exhibits a contrasting behavior to that observed with Nd 
substitution effect in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. With increasing y, the Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle 
decreases: the Bi-Ch1 plane becomes distorted. Therefore, the Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle 
(flatness of the Bi-Ch1 plane) cannot commonly explain the evolution of 
superconductivity in BiCh2-based superconductors. The contrasting changes in the 
in-plane structure (flatness) may be due to the difference in Ch2- ions at the Ch1 site. 
Figure 2d shows the y dependence of occupancy of Se at the Ch1 site. As it is clear in Fig. 
2d, Se ions selectively occupy the in-plane Ch1 site. At x = 0.5, approximately 90% of 
Ch1 site is occupied with Se. Recently, similar site selectivity of Se in LaO1-xFxBiSSe 
single crystals were reported [36]. The preferential occupation of Se2- with a larger ionic 
radius within the two-dimensional Bi-Ch1 plane may cause distortion. 
 Figure 2e shows the x (or y) dependences of three kinds of Bi-Ch distance. As depicted 
in a right-side image of the BiCh2 layer, a Bi ion is coordinated by six Ch ions. The 
shortest Bi-Ch distance is the Bi-Ch2 distance toward a c-axis direction. The Bi-Ch2 
distance for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 slightly decreases with increasing x. In contrast, the 
Bi-Ch2 distance for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 increases with increasing y. Therefore, the 
Bi-Ch2 distance should not be essential for the evolution of superconductivity within 
these two series. Next, we discuss the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance. The Bi-Ch1 (in-plane) 
distance for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibits a decrease with increasing x. In contrast, the 
Bi-Ch1 (in-plane) distance for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 increases with increasing y. These 
facts suggest that the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance itself cannot explain the evolution of 


6 
 
superconductivity. The longest Bi-Ch distance is Bi-Ch1 (inter-plane), which is roughly 
corresponding to the inter-layer distance of two BiCh2 layers. The Bi-Ch1 (inter-plane) 
distance for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not exhibit a remarkable change upon Nd 
substitution while that for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 clearly increases with increasing y. 
Therefore, the Bi-Ch1 (inter-plane) distance cannot commonly explain the evolution of 
superconductivity. 
 
Although we expected that a Ch1-Bi-C1 angle or some Bi-Ch distance exhibit a 
common behavior in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, we could not extract 
any clear correlation between them. However, we assumed that the in-plane Bi-Ch1 
distance should correlate with the evolution of superconductivity to a certain extent 
because the superconductivity is induced within the Bi-Ch1 plane, and their 
superconducting properties dramatically change by changing the crystal structure 
without changes in electron carrier concentration (F concentration). Therefore, we 
introduce a concept of in-plane chemical pressure to discuss the relationship between 
in-plane structure and evolution of superconductivity in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, and other REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors. 
 
Emergence of superconductivity by in-plane chemical pressure. 
 
Figure 3a shows schematic images of compression or expansion of Bi-Ch plane 
by Nd or Se substitution. In the case of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, Bi-Ch1 planes are 
compressed according to a decrease in volume of spacer layers with increasing Nd 
concentration (x). The compression of Bi-Ch1 plane results in an enhancement of 
packing density of Bi2.5+ and S2- ions within the superconducting plane: this is so-called 
in-plane chemical pressure. In the case of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, the in-plane Bi-Ch1 
distance increases with increasing occupancy of Se at the Ch1 site. However, the 
expansion of the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance is smaller than that simply expected from the 
difference in ionic radius of S2- and Se2- because the component of the spacer layer (LaO) 
never changes in LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. Therefore, the packing density of Bi2.5+ and Ch2- 
ions within the superconducting plane is enhanced. This situation is actually similar to 
the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. In order to 
compare degree of in-plane chemical pressure of two series, we define a value of in-plane 
chemical pressure using equation (1). 
 
   In-plane chemical pressure = (RBi + RCh1) / Bi-Ch1(in-plane)           (1) 
 
RBi is an ionic radius of Bi2.5+. Here, we assumed that the ionic radius of Bi2.5+ is 104.19 


7 
 
pm, which is obtained from the average of the six Bi-S bonds (four in-plane Bi-S1 bonds, 
one inter-plane Bi-S1 bond, and one Bi-S2 bond) determined from a crystal structure 
analysis with a single crystal of LaO0.54F0.46BiS2 [37]. RCh1 is an ionic radius of chalcogen 
at the Ch1 site: 184 and 198 pm for S2- and Se2-, respectively. In the case of 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, we calculated an average value for RCh1 using occupancy of Se at 
the Ch1 site. The Bi-Ch1 (in-plane) is the data obtained from Rietveld refinement (Fig. 
2e). We note that chemical pressure derived from ionic radii is a simple estimation, and 
it cannot describe exact orbital overlap between Bi and Ch. However, the assumption 
looks very useful to discuss the relationship between crystal structure and 
superconductive properties of these systems. 
 
The calculated in-plane chemical pressure is plotted as a function of x (or y) in 
Fig. 3b. For both systems, in-plane chemical pressure increases with increasing x (or y). 
Surprisingly, the chemical pressure, at which bulk superconductivity is induced, is 
almost 
the 
same 
(above 
~1.011) 
in 
between 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. On the basis of these experimental facts, we suggest that the 
emergence 
of 
bulk 
superconductivity 
in 
both 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 systems can commonly be explained by the increase of in-plane 
chemical pressure. The enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure should enhance the 
overlaps of Bi-6p and Ch-p orbitals. The enhancement of orbital overlaps would result in 
an enhancement of metallic conductivity and an inducement of bulk superconductivity 
in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 family. In the discussion part, we discuss the relationship between 
Tc and in-plane chemical pressure within the Bi-Ch1 plane. 
 
 
Discussion 
 
To discuss the relationship between Tc and in-plane chemical pressure, we 
plotted Tc for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 as a function of in-plane 
chemical pressure in Fig. 4. To obtain a general tendency in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 
superconductors, 
we 
added 
data 
points 
for 
Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 [analyzed in this study], NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [38], 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 [16], SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [18], and LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 (y = 1) single 
crystal [39]. Interestingly, data points for all the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type are located on a 
single slope highlighted by a blue region. Notably, the data points for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
SmO0.5F0.5BiS2, which do not exhibit superconductivity, locate on the left region of the 
boundary suggested in Fig. 4 (in-plane chemical pressure < 1.011). These facts suggest 
that the emergence of superconductivity and Tc of REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type simply depend on 


8 
 
degree 
of 
in-plane 
chemical 
pressure. 
If 
we 
consider 
the 
BCS 
(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory with electron-phonon mechanisms [40], the 
enhancement of Tc would be explained by an increase of phonon frequency and/or an 
enhancement of density of state at the Fermi level. Generally in metals, an increase in 
overlap of orbitals should decrease density of state due to an increase of band width. 
Therefore, an increase in density of state could not simply explain the enhancement of 
Tc in this series. Although phonon frequency might be enhanced with increasing 
in-plane chemical pressure, further experimental and theoretical investigations are 
needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the enhancement of Tc with increasing in-plane 
chemical pressure. Notably, Tc for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 and LaOBiSe2, indicated with a 
red region, are clearly located on a lower side of that for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type series. 
As an important fact, evolutions of Tc in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 do not 
correspond and exhibit different curves. For the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 compounds, 
in-plane chemical pressure is relatively stronger than that in REO0.5F0.5BiS2, but their 
Tc is clearly lower than those of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As described above, Se preferably 
occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Therefore, it can be considered that superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is induced in a Bi-(S,Se) or a Bi-Se plane. If we assume the BCS 
theory, the lower Tc in Bi-Se plane can be explained by a lower phonon frequency in 
Bi-Se plane than that in Bi-S plane due to the larger atomic number of Se. In order to 
confirm the assumption above and mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based 
family, we need to obtain other REO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductors like CeO0.5F0.5BiSe2 or 
NdO0.5F0.5BiSe2 and add data points on an extension of the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 series. 
As a conclusion with Fig. 4, we expect that a higher Tc would be obtained with Bi-S 
plane with a higher in-plane chemical pressure in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2-type compounds. 
 
At the end, we briefly discuss about the HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 which 
shows the highest Tc among BiCh2-based superconductors [13,28-32]. T. Tomita et al. 
reported that the crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 above 0.7 GPa was monoclinic [31]. 
In the monoclinic structure, the Bi-S1 plane is distorted into a zigzag chain with a 
shorter Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å; zigzag chains are connected with a longer Bi-S1 
distance of 3.03 Å to each other. In fact, we reported in-plane anisotropy of upper critical 
field within the Bi-S1 plane in a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, implying the emergence of 
quasi-one-dimensional superconducting states within the distorted Bi-S1 plane of a HP 
phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [41]. If we simply calculate the value of chemical pressure using 
a Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å with the equation (1), we obtain chemical pressure of 1.06. (In 
this case, obtained chemical pressure is not in-plane chemical pressure but 
quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure.) Chemical pressure of 1.06 and Tc of 10 K 


9 
 
give a data point locating on a rough extension of the Tc-chemical pressure curve for the 
other REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors discussed in Fig. 4. This might indicate that the 
enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure, not in-plane chemical 
pressure, would be essential for the evolution of superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 
compounds. To further discuss and understand the relationship between chemical 
pressure and superconductivity in the BiCh2 family, investigations of crystal structure 
and superconducting properties for new BiS2-, BiSe2-based and/or BiTe2-based 
compounds with various spacer layers are needed. 
 In summary, we have analyzed crystal structure of optimally-doped BiCh2-based 
superconductors 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 
using 
powder 
synchrotron XRD to reveal relationship between crystal structure and superconducting 
properties in BiCh2-based layered compounds. We have found that the enhancement of 
in-plane chemical pressure could commonly induce bulk superconductivity in both 
systems. Furthermore, we revealed that Tc for the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors 
could be determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure and a kind of Ch element 
composing superconducting Bi-Ch planes. In addition, on the basis of discussion on the 
relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 
compounds and a monoclinic phase (high pressure phase) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we suggest 
a possibility that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure within a 
Bi-Ch chain, not in-plane (two-dimensional) chemical pressure, would be essential for a 
higher Tc in BiCh2-based superconductors. 
 
 
 
Methods 
 Polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 used in this 
study were prepared using solid state reaction. The detailed synthesis procedures were 
described in previous reports [33,34]. Powder synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction 
measurements were performed at room temperature at the BL02B2 experimental 
station of SPring-8 (JASRI; Proposal No. 2014B1003 and 2014B1071). The wavelength 
of the radiation beam was 0.49542(4) Å. We have performed the Rietveld refinement 
(RIETAN-FP [42]) for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using a typical 
structure model of REOBiCh2-based superconductor with a tetragonal space group of 
P4/nmm [36,37]. Contributions from impurity phases of rare-earth fluorides (REF3) 
and/or Bi2S3 are included in Rietveld refinement. In addition, we have analyzed a 
crystal 
structure 
for 
two 
related 
compounds 
of 
Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 


10 
 
Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 to enrich the discussion part [33]. The obtained crystal structure 
parameters are summarized in Table S1. The schematic images of crystal structure 
were drawn using VESTA [43].

Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. 
a. Superconductivity phase diagrams of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. For x = 0 and 0.2, 
superconducting transition is not observed at T > 2 K. For 0.4 ≤ x ≤ 1, superconducting 
transition with a large shielding signal, with which we could regard the samples as a 
bulk superconductor (Bulk SC), is observed. Tc increases with increasing x. An inset 
figure shows a schematic image of crystal structure of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
b. Superconductivity phase diagrams of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. For y = 0 and 0.1, 
superconducting transition is observed but their shielding signals are very small as a 
bulk superconductor (Filamentary SC). For y ≥ 0.2, superconducting transition with a 
large shielding signal is observed (Bulk SC). Tc increases with increasing y up to y = 0.5. 
An inset figure shows a schematic image of crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2.

a. Lattice constant of a for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is plotted as a 
function of x (or y). Data points for the samples showing bulk superconductivity (Bulk 
SC in Fig. 1) are highlighted with orange-filled circles in Figs. 2a-2e. 
b. Lattice constant of c for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is plotted as a 
function of x (or y). 
c. Evolution of Ch1-Bi-Ch1 angle for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 as a

d. Se concentration (y) dependence of occupancy of Se at the Ch1 site in the Bi-Ch1 
plane for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. 
e. Evolution of three kinds of Bi-Ch distance for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 as a function of x (or y). The right crystal structure image 
describes the Bi, Ch1 and Ch2 sites, and three Bi-Ch distances: Bi-Ch1 (in-plane), 
Bi-Ch1 (inter-plane), and Bi-Ch2.

Fig. 3. Effect of in-plane chemical pressure to superconductivity in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. 
a. Schematic image of changes in crystal structure with increasing in-plane chemical 
pressure in Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2. In Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2, a 
volume of spacer layer decreases with increasing Nd concentration (x), and Bi-S plane is 
compressed; hence, in-plane chemical pressure is enhanced. In LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, a 
volume of superconducting Bi-Ch1 layer increases with increasing Se concentration (y). 
However, the expansion of Bi-Ch1 plane is smaller than that expected from the the ionic 
radius of S2- and Se2- because the component of the spacer layer (LaO layer) does not 
change; 
hence, 
in-plane 
chemical 
pressure 
is 
enhanced 
as 
well 
as 
in 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
b. In-plane chemical pressure for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2, 
calculated using the equation (1), are plotted as a function of x (or y). In both systems, 
bulk superconductivity is induced with increasing chemical pressure. The dashed line at 
an in-plane chemical pressure of ~1.011 is an estimated boundary of bulk-SC and 
non-SC regions.
