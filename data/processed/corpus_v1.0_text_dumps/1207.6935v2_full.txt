We report the electrical resistivity measurements under pressure for the recently discovered BiS2-based
layered superconductors Bi4O4S3 and La(O,F)BiS2. In Bi4O4S3, the transition temperature Tc decreases
monotonically without a distinct change in the metallic behavior in the normal state. In La(O,F)BiS2,
on the other hand, Tc initially increases with increasing pressure and then decreases above ∼1 GPa.
The semiconducting behavior in the normal state is suppressed markedly and monotonically, whereas the
evolution of Tc is nonlinear. The strong suppression of the semiconducting behavior without doping in
La(O,F)BiS2 suggests that the Fermi surface is located in the vicinity of some instability. In the present
study, we elucidate that the superconductivity in the BiS2 layer favors the Fermi surface at the boundary
between the semiconducting and metallic behaviors.

The appearance of new superconductors with a BiS2
layer has opened a new route in the ﬁeld of fascinat-
ing layered superconductors.1 Soon after the ﬁrst dis-
covery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3, another system
with the same BiS2 layer, La(O,F)BiS2, joined the family
of this compound.2 The discovery of superconductivity
in this system is signiﬁcant in many aspects, because it
gives an opportunity for wide and thorough investiga-
tions using a variety of related materials possessing the
BiS2 layer along with the possible substitution of rare-
earth ions as well as Fe-based superconductors. In fact,
isostructural Nd(O,F)BiS2 has also shown superconduc-
tivity.3 This derivative ﬁnding revealed that the super-
conductivity occurring in the BiS2 layer is robust against
magnetic elements. For either Bi4O4S3 and La(O,F)BiS2,
superconductivity can be obtained by carrier (electron)
doping into the band insulators Bi6O8S5 or LaOBiS2.
The band calculation for the composition Bi4O4S3 sug-
gests that the Fermi level is located at the peak of the
density of states, which mainly originates from the Bi
6p orbitals.1 LaOBiS2 also has a similar band structure,
and the F-doping of x = 0.5 corresponds to the Fermi
level with a high density of states in the rigid band pic-
ture.4 An important suggestion by the band calculations
is that the bands possess a quasi-one-dimensional char-
acter, which originates from the diﬀerence in the con-
tribution between the px and py orbitals, for both com-
pounds. This gives a good nesting property, suggestive of
the importance of electron correlations for superconduc-
tivity.1, 4 Another notable point is that the Fermi level
for the nominal composition is located in the vicinity of
the topological change in the Fermi surface.4 If this su-
perconductivity originates from the electric correlation,
this suggests that the superconducting (SC) symmetry

can change depending on the doping level.4
Among the three compounds discovered thus far, the
maximum Tc is ∼10 K for La(O,F)BiS2. It is an in-
triguing issue how a high Tc is possible in the BiS2 layer.
The doping dependence of Tc has been investigated in
Nd(O,F)BiS2, and the peak of Tc appears at x = 0.3
although it is not so sensitive to the doping level.3 In
addition to the change in the doping level, the struc-
tural compression by applying pressure is also an eﬀec-
tive method of exploring the optimized condition for su-
perconductivity. The lattice constants at ambient pres-
sure are diﬀerent among the compounds: a = 3.9592 ˚A
for Bi4O4S3 and a = 4.0527 ˚A for La(O,F)BiS2.1, 2 Tc
is twofold higher in La(O,F)BiS2 than in Bi4O4S3. This
suggests that the lattice parameter is an important factor
for superconductivity.
A polycrystalline sample of Bi4O4S3 was prepared by
the solid-state reaction method,1 while a polycrystalline
sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 was obtained by a two-step
process including high-pressure annealing.2 The compo-
sition expressed here is a nominal one for both com-
pounds. Electrical resistivity (ρ) measurement at high
pressures of up to ∼4 GPa was carried out using an
indenter cell.5 It was measured by a four-probe method
using silver paint for contact. We used Daphne 7474 as
a pressure-transmitting medium.6 The applied pressure
was estimated from the Tc of the lead manometer. The
present sample of Bi4O4S3 contains Bi as an impurity,
and it shows superconductivity above 2.55 GPa accom-
panied by a structural phase transition. We applied pres-
sure of above 2 GPa to Bi4O4S3, but it obstructs the
evaluation of Tc intrinsic to Bi4O4S3; thus we omitted
the data from this paper.
Figures 1(a) and (b) show the temperature dependence
of resistivity for Bi4O4S3 at pressures of up to 1.92 GPa.

Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependence of re-
sistivity for La(O,F)BiS2 below 300 K measured at sev-
eral pressures of up to ∼4 GPa. It shows semiconduct-
ing behavior at ambient pressure in contrast to that
for Bi4O4S3. This semiconducting behavior is extremely
sensitive to pressure and is suppressed under pressure.
We cannot see the obvious semiconducting behavior at
∼4 GPa, at which resistivity is almost temperature-
independent, which seems to be produced by the compa-
rable contributions of phonon scattering and the semi-
conducting behavior. Figure 3(b) shows the data near Tc
at low temperatures. Tc evidently increases by applying
pressure up to ∼1 GPa, however, it then decreases above
∼1 GPa. Both T onset

We attempted to estimate the energy gap assum-
ing that the semiconducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
originates in the small gap in the band structure. Figure

GPa. The lines in the ﬁgure correspond to the simple
activation-type relation ρ ∝exp(∆1,2/kBT ). As seen in
the ﬁgure, the ﬁtting by a single gap is impossible in the

ting in the temperature range of 200 −300 K, while ∆2
is obtained in the temperature range between ∼20 K
and Tc. Here, we neglected the contribution of scattering
by phonons, but it is comparable to the semiconducting
behavior at higher pressures; thus, the estimation of ∆1,2
above 2 GPa was not carried out. The gap sizes are es-
timated to be ∆1/kB ∼140 K and ∆2/kB ∼1.86 K at
ambient pressure. The slopes of both lines in the ﬁgure
gradually decrease and the semiconducting behavior is
suppressed with increasing pressure.

for La(O,F)BiS2, the pressure dependence of ρ at
11 K just above Tc, and the tentatively estimated en-
ergy gaps ∆1,2. The high resistivity at low temperatures
induced by the semiconducting behavior is markedly sup-
pressed by applying pressure, especially up to ∼1 GPa.
The decrease in ∆1,2 is monotonic. Tc initially shows a
steep increase; however, it gradually decreases above ∼1
GPa. The slope above ∼1 GPa is ∼−0.4 GPa/K. The
highest Tc obtained at 0.5−1 GPa is achieved just after a
large suppression of the semiconducting behavior, and Tc
monotonically decreases upon approaching the metallic
region.
We ﬁrst discuss the origin of the strong suppression of
the semiconducting behavior in La(O,F)BiS2 under pres-
sure. When we consider the present pressure eﬀect along
with the calculated band structure,1, 4 we encounter a
problem with the actual doping level of electrons. The
band calculation based on the nominal composition has
indicated that the Fermi energy is located at the peak
position of the density of states in Bi4O4S3.1 A high
density of states at the Fermi level is also expected in
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 for the nominal composition.4 Case 1 in
Fig. 6 corresponds to the Fermi level close to the es-
timation from the nominal composition. If the Fermi

level only crosses the lower band near (π, 0), and the
upper band decreases relatively under pressure, then the
change in the Fermi surface will give a large evolution
of the resistivity. However this will be in contradiction
to the semiconducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 be-
cause the Fermi surface is well established for the dop-
ing level of 0.5 electrons/unit cell. If the semiconducting
behavior originates from the thermal change in carrier
density, it is naturally conjectured that the carrier den-
sity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is much lower than that expected
from the nominal composition, and that the Fermi level
is most likely close to the edge of the conduction band.
Here, we conjecture possible origin of the band gap or gap
like behavior that explain the semiconducting behavior.
The ﬁrst one is the original band gap between the con-
duction band and the valence band. In the band structure
of undoped LaOBiS2,4 the band gap is estimated to be
∼0.4 eV, but this tends to be reduced owing to the struc-
tural change by F doping, giving a semi metal-like band
structure, as shown in Fig. 6.10 If the band gap is already
small at ambient pressure, thermal excitation from the
valence band, which is mainly formed by oxygen orbitals,
into the conduction band is possible within the observed
temperature range. Pressure may help to close the band
gap. The second origin is the energy gap between the
conduction band and the impurity level originating from
the insuﬃcient doping, as shown in Fig. 6 (Case 2). The
third origin is the thermal hopping in the impurity level,

the position estimated from the nominal composition. The marked
change in the resistivity under pressure might be explained by the
topological change in the Fermi surface, but it is diﬃcult to ex-
plain the semiconducting behavior. In Case 2, conduction is mainly
governed by the impurity level or band. Pressure promotes the for-
mation of the impurity band or the overlap of the impurity and
conduction bands.
which gives gap like behavior. The semiconducting be-
havior is robust against magnetic ﬁeld up to 5 T;2 thus,
the tentatively estimated small gap ∆2 might not orig-
inate from a pure band-gap but be attributed in such
thermal hopping in Case 2 scenario. Quantitative discus-
sion is diﬃcult at present; however, the semiconducting
behavior in LaOBiS2 seems to suggest the presence of an
impurity level. In such a case, it can be conjectured that
applying pressure promotes the formation of the impu-
rity band or the overlap of the impurity and conduction
bands, resulting in a decrease in the gaps.
Next, we discuss superconductivity in the BiS2-based
systems. The present pressure experiments suggest that
a high Tc is obtained at the boundary between the semi-
conducting and metallic behaviors: Tc in semiconduct-
ing LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is twofold higher than that in metal-
lic Bi4O4S3, and once metallic behavior appears, Tc de-
creases monotonically as seen in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 above
∼1 GPa and in Bi4O4S3 from ambient pressure. Simi-
larly, in the isostructural NdO1−xFxBiS2, Tc is not sen-
sitive to the doping level but its maximum is obtained
at x = 0.3 at which slight semiconducting behavior is
observed.3 These suggest that a high density of states is
not important for a high Tc in these systems. The situ-
ation for achieving a high Tc is reminiscent of the dop-
ing dependence of LixZrNCl, whose electronic speciﬁc
heat coeﬃcient is γ ∼1 mJ/molK2.11 Tc in LixZrNCl
increases signiﬁcantly upon approaching the band insu-
lator.12 The highest Tc in LixZrNCl is achieved when re-
sistivity shows almost temperature-independent behav-
ior. The evolution of Tc against the doping level cannot
be explained by the framework of phonon-mediated su-
perconductivity,13 and can be interpreted by the nest-
ing scenario.14 If the Fermi surface is well established by
suﬃcient doping in the BiS2-based system, the nesting
scenario is a good candidate;4 if not, other mechanisms
might be required.
In summary, we have measured the electrical resis-
tivity under pressure for the BiS2 based layered super-
conductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Tc in metallic
Bi4O4S3 decreases monotonically with increasing pres-
sure, whereas Tc in semiconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 ini-
tially increases and then decreases upon approaching the
metallic region. The strong suppression of the semicon-
ducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the
Fermi surface is in the vicinity of some instability. It is
plausible that the Fermi level is located near the edge of
the conduction band. This indicates that superconduc-
tivity is realized in the complex Fermi surface includ-
ing the impurity band with a low carrier density and a
low density of states, and it rather provides beneﬁt for
achieving a higher Tc.
