Abstract 
    We report superconductivity in a new layered bismuth oxyselenide LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 with the 
ZrCuSiAs-type structure composed of alternating superconducting BiSe2 and blocking LaO 
layers. The superconducting transition temperature is TC = 2.6K, as revealed from DC 
magnetization, resistivity and muon spin rotation (µSR) experiments. DC magnetization 
measurements indicate  a superconducting volume fraction of approximately 80%, which is at 
least twice higher in comparison to that found in corresponding sulphide LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Importantly, the bulk character of superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was confirmed by 
µSR. 
I. Introduction 
Recent discovery of superconductivity with TC around 8.6K in layered bismuth 
oxysulphide Bi4O4S3 with ZrCuSiAs - structure type1, 2 evoked intensive studies 
concerning the improvement of their superconducting properties. This material has a 
layered structure composed of superconducting (SC) BiS2 layers and blocking layers 
of Bi4O4(SO4)1−x , where x indicates the defects of SO2− ions at the interlayer sites.

The sandwich structure of the SC and blocking layer is analogous to those of high 
temperature (high-Tc ) cuprates and Fe-based superconductors. In both systems, Tc can 
be enhanced by varying the blocking layers. The changing the blocking layer in 
Bi4O4S3 resulted in a new BiS2 based superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
shows a small SC volume fraction for ambient pressure but achieves bulk 
superconductivity under high pressure with Tc as high as 10.6 K. Those findings 
stimulated the scientific community for further investigations on different dopings and 
shortly after the first report on LaO0.5F0.5BiS2  a set of new superconductors different 
substitutions with Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb for lanthanum appeared. 3, 4, 5, 6  
Superconducting LnO1-xFxBiS2 materials are structurally related to the well-
known layered iron based superconductor: LaO1-xFxFeAs7, with the appearance of 
superconductivity after doping with fluorine. It has been found also that 
superconductivity in the LaOBiS2 system can be induced not only by substituting 
oxygen for fluorine but also by increasing charge-carrier density (electron doping) 
through substitution of tetravalent elements, i.e. Th, Hf, Zr, and Ti for trivalent La8. 
By electron doping the parent phases of LaOBiS2 and ThOBiS2, considered as bad 
metals, become superconducting with Tc of up to 2.85 K. On the other hand, an hole 
doping realized by substitution of divalent Sr for trivalent La did not induce 
superconductivity in those materials. 
Another similarity of the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds to the abovementioned 
layered pnictide and chalcogenide systems is the sensitivity of their SC properties to 
the change of structural parameters. The structure compression realized by an 
application of external pressure results in suppression of semiconducting behavior and 
enhances Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 to 10.6K, PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 to 7.6K and 6.4K for 
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2  in the same way as layered pnictides and chalcogenides do. With 


3 
 
increasing pressure all the BiS2 – type compounds show qualitatively similar 
evolution of superconducting transition temperature – an abrupt transformation from 
low Tc phase to a high Tc one with a characteristic maximum at pressures within the 
range from ca. 1.5  to about 2.5 GPa9,10. 
The existence of many common features related to crystal and band structure 
between BiS2 – based superconductors and pnictides/chalcogenides  raised the 
question about the mechanisms of superconductivity in the newly discovered system. 
Theoretical considerations of density of states, band structure and Fermi surface 
nesting studied  by means of the first principles calculations indicated that the 
insulating LaOBiS2 parent phase (band gap of 0.15eV) transforms into metallic state 
after doping with fluorine11. At the optimal dopant content (x=0.5) there are four 
bands originating from the px and py orbitals of Bi, which cross the Fermi level. The 
surface nesting of LaO1-xFxBiS2 was found to be weaker than that of  corresponding 
pnictide LaOFeAs.  
Superconductivity in the BiS2-based compounds seems to be still under debate 
and even one of the reports indicates that superconducting response in Bi4O4S3 is not a 
bulk phenomenon and might be impurity driven12. On the other hand recent 
publication about single crystals of NdO1-xFxBiS2 grown by flux method13 confirms 
clearly the bulk nature of superconductivity in BiS- type layered materials. An 
intensive work performed on different substitutions brought new BiS2 – based 
materials with different substitutions for rare earth metals and in LnO – layer, 
however no attempts with substitutions in BiS2 layer were tried up today. In the 
present 
work 
the 
new 
compounds 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, 
LaO0.5F0.5BiTe2, 
and 
LaO0.5F0.5SbS2 were synthesized and characterized using X-ray powder diﬀraction, 
neutron powder diffraction, resistivity, and magnetization experiments.

It was observed that replacement of sulfur by isovalent selenium results in a new 
superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. Superconducting properties of this compound was 
further investigated by means of µSR technique, which strongly indicates bulk 
superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2. The compounds LaO0.5F0.5BiTe2 and 
LaO0.5F0.5SbS2 do not reveal superconductivity down to T=1.7K. 
II. Experimental 
Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 were obtained via solid state reaction from 
high purity (at least 99.99%, Alfa) powders of La2O3, LaF3 and Se. Appropriate 
amounts of lanthanum metal and bismuth pieces were used to keep the proper molar 
ratio of reacting species. Starting materials with nominal composition LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 
were weighted in the He-filled glove box, carefully mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed 
in evacuated quartz ampoules and preheated at 800ºC for 15 hours. Afterwards the 
products were transferred to glove-box, thoroughly ground in the mortar under helium 
atmosphere, pressed again into pellets and re-sealed under vacuum in quartz 
ampoules. Next the ampoules were heated again at 800ºC for 48h followed by cooling 
to 300ºC and quenching  in air. To avoid any contamination form environment the as 
synthesized materials were transferred to glove-box and kept in inert atmosphere. 
The phase purity of the as prepared materials  was characterized by powder X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) using a D8 Advance Bruker AXS diffractometer with Cu Kα 
radiation. For these measurements a low background airtight specimen holder was 
used. The samples were additionally studied by means of neutron powder diffraction 
(NPD) at the SINQ spallation source of the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI, Switzerland) 
using the high-resolution diffractometer for thermal neutrons, HRPT,14 with the 
neutron wavelengths λ = 1.494 and 1.886 Å. To avoid degradation in air  the samples 


5 
 
were loaded into a vanadium containers with an indium seal in an He glove box. The 
Rietveld refinements of the crystal structure parameters were done using the FullProf 
package15 with the use of its internal tables. 
The magnetic susceptibility was measured by a SQUID magnetometer (Quantum 
Design MPMS-XL). Temperature dependent measurements of the resistivity were 
carried out using a standard four-probe method in a Physical Property Measurement 
System (Quantum Design PPMS). 
 Transverse-field (TF) µSR experiments were performed at the πM3 beamline of the 
Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland), using the general purpose instrument 
(GPS). The sample was mounted inside of a gas-flow 4He cryostat on a sample holder 
with a standard veto setup providing essentially a low-background µSR signal.  
III. Results and discussion 
A. Crystal structure and sample quality 
The samples after sintering are black in color and hard in nature. X-ray powder 
diffraction and neutron powder diffraction studies of the as sintered material revealed 
that except a main phase LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 with tetragonal ZrCuSiAs –type structure 
fitted to  P4/nmm crystal metric with a = 4.15941(7) and c = 14.01567(34) Å. The as 
grown samples contain also impurity phases such as traces of unreacted starting 
materials i.e. La2O3 and Bi, and possibly Bi2Se3 or other binary Bi-Se compounds. 
Layered structure of the new compound resembles similar features as those of sulphur 
analogue  and  consists of  alternating La2(OF)2 (fluorine doped rare earth oxide layer) 
and BiSe2 (fluorite type) sheets. Atomic coordinates, Wyckoff positions and site 
occupancies for studied samples are listed in Table1.

temperature range between 1.8 K and 300 K.

(b) Low temperature resistivity data under magnetic fields up to 1 T.  
 The metallic behavior is observed above 5 K state with the residual resistivity value 
of 0.12 mΩcm. The transition to the superconducting state is clearly visible below 
Tc
onset ≈ 2.7 K, as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 1a.  Note that the metallic behavior of 
the normal state was also observed in the superconductor Bi4O4S3. However, for this 
compound much higher value for the residual resistivity 2 mΩcm was reported. The 
metallic character of resistivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 is in contrast to the semiconducting 


8 
 
behavior observed for corresponding LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, widely described in the 
literature. Note that the new compounds LaO0.5F0.5BiTe2 and LaO0.5F0.5SbS2 were also 
synthesized, but no superconductivity was observed down to 1.7 K. Low temperature 
resistivity data recorded in zero field and under applied  magnetic fields up to 1 T for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2  are presented in Fig.1b. The superconducting states are destroyed by 
applying high magnetic fields. 
C. Magnetization 
   To determine whether superconductivity is a bulk phenomenon in LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, 
zero field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC) magnetic susceptibility χ was measured 
in a  magnetic field of µ0H = 0.5 mT.  The results shown in Fig.2 evidence sharp 
superconducting onset  at 2.6 K as indicated by a vertical gray line. The value of ZFC 
susceptibility at 1.8 K corresponds to about 80 % volume fraction of 
superconductivity. It is clear that, even though the superconducting transition is 
incomplete at 1.8 K the volume fraction at that temperature is appreciable. The strong 
diamagnetic signal below Tc is consistent with bulk superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2.

susceptibility of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2  in a magnetic field of  µ0H = 0.5 mT.  The vertical gray line 
denotes the superconducting transition temperature Tc. (b) Field dependence of  the magnetic 
moment  at T = 1.8 K in an applied field up to µ0H  = 100 mT. The inset shows the low field 
data. 
 The field dependence of the magnetic moment of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was studied at the 
base temperature T = 1.8 K for external magnetic fields up to µ0H = 100 mT and 
shown in Fig. 2b. The inset demonstrates that  the initial flux penetration and the 
deviation from linearity determine the lower critical field of this compound µ0Hc1 = 


10 
 
0.5 mT. The second critical field was found to be also small: µ0Hc2 = 60 mT. Note, 
that wide open magnetic moment hysteresis m(H) loop of the studied compound 
demonstrates its bulk superconductivity. 
D. Muon spin rotation measurements 
  Fig. 3 exhibits the transverse-field (TF) muon-time spectra for LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 
measured in an applied magnetic field of µ0H = 11.5 mT in the SC state at 1.5 K.

gyromagnetic ratio, and phi is the initial phase of the muon-spin ensemble. µ0Hint 
represents the internal magnetic field at the muon site, and the relaxation rates σsc and 


11 
 
σnm characterize the damping due to the formation of the FLL in the superconducting  
state and of the nuclear magnetic dipolar contribution, respectively. In the analysis 
σnm was assumed to be constant over the entire temperature range and was fixed to the 
value σnm = 0.114(2) µs-1 obtained above Tc where only nuclear magnetic moments 
contribute to the muon depolarization rate σ. As indicated by the solid lines in Fig. 4, 
the µSR data are well described by Eq. (1). The temperature dependence of  σsc for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 is shown in Fig. 4a. Below Tc ≈ 2.6 K, the relaxation rate σsc starts to 
increase from zero due to the presence of a nonuniform local field distribution as a 
result of the formation of a flux-line lattice (FLL) in the SC state. It is worth 
mentioning that the value of σ in the SC state is rather small, which implies that the 
magnetic penetration depth λ, which is one of the fundamental parameters of a 
superconductor, is sufficiently large (since the data points for σ below 1.5 K are 
missing in the present work, it is not possible to determine the zero temperature limit 
of σ, which would allow to determine λ(T=0)). Note that recent detailed µSR studies16 
on the similar system Bi4O4S3 revealed that it also exhibits one of the highest λ among 
all other superconductors.

  In Fig.4b the temperature dependence of the µ0Hint is presented. µ0Hint increases with 
decreasing temperature in the normal state, which may be caused by an enhancement 
of the paramagnetic susceptibility of the sample LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2  upon lowering the 
temperature. Decrease of the internal field µ0Hint (diamagnetic shift) was observed 
below  Tc ≈ 2.6 K, which is evident from Fig. 4(b). Observed diamagnetic shift as well 
as the increase of σ confirms the bulk character of superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2.

4. Summary 
In conclusion we report on a synthesis, crystal structure and SC properties of a new 
Se-containing layered superconductor: LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, obtained by replacement of 
sulphur for selenium in recently reported  BiS2 – type superconductors. By this 
substitution the volume of the crystal unit cell increases and the c-parameter expands 
from 13.3157 Å to 14.01567Å. The new superconductor exhibits bulk 
superconductivity with Tc = 2.6K. DC magnetization measurements revealed a 
superconducting shielding fraction of approximately 80 %, which is at least twice 
higher in comparison to that found in corresponding sulphide LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
Moreover, bulk superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5 BiSe2 was conﬁrmed by µSR 
experiments.  
No superconducting transition was observed in analogous phases: LaO0.5F0.5SbS2 with 
antimony substituted for bismuth and LaO0.5F0.5BiTe2 with tellurium for Se.
