Abstract 
Decomposition of superconductors sometimes becomes crucial when studying essential 
physical properties of the superconductors. For example, the cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-
d decomposes by long-time air exposure. In this study, we investigate the aging effects on 
superconducting properties of BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, both were 
first synthesized in 2012, using their polycrystalline samples synthesized several years ago. We 
find that 12-year-old Bi4O4S3 samples exhibit bulk superconductivity with a slight degradation of 
the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 0.2 K. For a high-pressure-synthesized 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, clear decrease in Tc is observed, which suggests that high-pressure strain 
is reduced by aging.

1. Introduction 
Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon characterized with zero-resistivity states, 
diamagnetism, and Josephson effects, and the superconducting states emerge at temperatures 
below the transition temperature (Tc). Using those properties, superconductivity application has 
been developed and will be more diverse in near future [1]. Since application of superconducting 
devices requires stability of the components of the device, degradation of the properties and/or 
decomposition of the compound components become crucial problems. For example, cuprate (Cu-
oxide) high-Tc superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-d decomposes by long-time air exposure [2˗4]. In 
addition, the use of reactive ions in the constituent elements or the presence of quasi-stable phases 
with a formation energy comparable to the target phase results in decomposition of the obtained 
samples by aging in the air-exposure environment [5˗7]. Knowledge on phase stability and aging 
effects is also important when studying superconducting properties because the change in 
superconducting properties after aging affects the conclusion of the research. For some rare cases, 
positive aging effects are observed, and one of the examples is the improvement of Tc in Fe(Te,S) 
by aging with air exposure [8]. 
 
Here, we investigate the aging effects of BiS2-based superconductors Bi4O4S3 and 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Those superconductors were discovered in 2012 [9˗11], followed by the discovery 
of various related superconductors [12˗22]. The crystal structure of BiS2-based compounds is 
basically composed of alternate stacks of a blocking (insulating) layer and a BiS2 conducting layer 
(Fig. 1), which is similar to stacking structures of cuprates and Fe-based high-Tc superconductors 
[23˗26]. The Bi4O4S3 sample exhibits bulk superconductivity without any high-pressure treatments 
[9,27˗30]. In contrast, the polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not exhibit bulk 
superconductivity, and high-pressure annealing or synthesis under high-pressure conditions (with 
1˗3 GPa) is needed to induce bulk superconductivity [10,31˗35]. Furthermore, degradation of 
superconducting properties of ambient-pressure annealing of the high-pressure-annealed (bulk-
superconducting) LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample was observed [36]. The cause of the absence of bulk 
superconductivity in La(O,F)BiS2 systems are explained by local Bi-S distance disorder [37˗42] 
and the formation of superstructure [43]. Therefore, the high-pressure effects in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
sample should be affected by aging even at ambient temperature condition, and studying aging 
effects after keeping the samples for long time at ambient conditions enables us to know their 
aging effects. Here, we re-investigate the superconducting properties of the oldest Bi4O4S3 sample 


3 
 
synthesized in April of 2012 [9,27] and the Bi4O4S3 34S-isotope samples prepared in 2020 [44]. In 
addition, the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample high-pressure-synthesized in 2014 [35] is studied. In Japan, 
the birth years are categorized with Japanese zodiac, and people use the 12-year period to celebrate 
anniversaries. This year is the first 12 years since the discovery of BiS2-based superconductors, 
and reinvestigations every 12 years will be useful. 
2. Experimental 
The polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 were previously synthesized 
and stored in a glass container with air in an office of Tokyo Metropolitan university (TMU, 
Hachioji city). The details of sample preparation methods are reported in Refs. 9, 12, 20, and 29. 
For the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, high-pressure sintering under 2 GPa at 700 °C was performed in 
2014 [35]. Here, we label the Bi4O4S3 samples as follows. Bi4O4S3 (#1) was prepared by 
Mizuguchi et al. in 2012 at TMU [9]. Bi4O4S3 (#2) was prepared by Singh et al. in 2012 at National 
Physical Laboratory (NPL)-India [27] and send to TMU, followed by keeping in TMU. Bi4O4S3  
(#3) with 34S was synthesized in 2020 for an isotope-effect study [44]. 
Temperature (T) dependences of magnetization (M) after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) 
and field cooling (FC) were measured using a superconducting quantum interference device 
(SQUID) magnetometer with an applied magnetic field (H) of H = 10 Oe. Powder X-ray powder 
diffraction (XRD) was carried out using RIGAKU diffractometer Miniflex-II (in 2012) and 
Miniflex 600 (in 2024). 
3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 2 shows the comparison of XRD patterns of Bi4O4S3 (#1) taken in 2012 (as-
synthesized) and 2024 (12-years old). Except for the differences in the intensity ratio, which are 
caused by the sample setting, the observed patterns are quite similar. Therefore, the Bi4O4S3 phase 
does not exhibits clear decomposition in the level of laboratory XRD in 12 years. Figure 3 shows 
the T dependances of M for Bi4O4S3 (#1) measured in (a) 2012 and (b) 2024. Bulk 
superconductivity signals are observed in both data, which is consistent with the XRD results. We 
estimated Tconset from cross point of two lines as shown in the insets. Tconset slightly decreased from 
5.0 to 4.8 K in 12 years. This change might be caused by slight change in crystal structure or carrier 
concentration because the Bi4O4S3 phase possesses a complicated stacking structure. Another 
potential reason for the Tc change is release of strain effect. Although the Bi4O4S3 (#1) sample was 


4 
 
synthesized at ambient pressure, the as-synthesized sample might have some strain effects 
generated during the pelletizing and/or annealing processes. However, the change in Tc is quite 
small, and we consider that there is almost no aging effect in the 12-years-old Bi4O4S3 sample. 
Next, we see the current superconducting property of Bi4O4S3 (#2) synthesized in NPL-
India and stored in TMU for more than 11 years. Figure 4 shows the T dependances of M for 
Bi4O4S3 (#2) measured in 2024. Bulk superconductivity is confirmed by the large diamagnetic 
signals, and Tconset is 4.4 K, which is comparable to Tc reported in Ref. 27. In addition, M-T for the 
Bi4O4S3 (#3) sample with 34S is shown in Fig. 5. As well known, 32S is dominant in nature and 34S 
is a rarer isotope that 32S. The comparison of ZFC data clearly shows that there is no degradation 
of superconducting property. The estimated Tcs are almost same, 4.81 K (taken in 2020) and 4.80 
K (taken in 2024). 
Finally, we investigate the superconducting property of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 synthesized by 
high-pressure sintering under 2 GPa (HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2). Figure 6 shows the T dependances of M 
for HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 measured in (a) 2014 and (b) 2024. Clear decrease in Tc is observed after 
10-years storage. Although bulk nature of superconductivity is maintained, the irreversibility 
temperature (Tirr), which is estimated from the bifurcation point of ZFC and FC data, decreases 
from 9.4 to 7.0 K. Because Tirr of the BiS2-based samples roughly corresponds to zero-resistivity 
temperature (Tczero) in resistivity measurement, Tczero should be degraded in 10 years. Because of 
the limitation of the original sample of HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we cannot perform resistivity 
experiments. The aging effect, the decrease in superconducting property, in HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 
would be explained by the reduction of strain effects generated by high-pressure sintering. As 
shown in Ref. 45, crystal structure changes from tetragonal to monoclinic by external pressure. 
The high-pressure-synthesized samples also exhibits XRD peak broadening even after removing 
pressure [9,34,35]. The broadened XRD peak is recovered by annealing the sample at ambient 
pressure [36]. Therefore, the observed aging effect should be related to the release of high-pressure 
strain effects in the sample. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We investigated the aging effects on crystal structural, decomposition, and 
superconducting properties of BiS2-based compounds Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 using XRD and 
magnetization measurements. For the Bi4O4S3 sample, no aging effect on XRD was observed, and 


5 
 
quite small decrease in Tc (0.2 K) was observed for the 12-years-old sample. As a conclusion, there 
is almost no aging effects in Bi4O4S3. In contrast, the HP-LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample exhibits a clear 
aging effect in magnetization data. Tirr decreases from 9.4 to 7.0 K. Because the high-pressure-
synthesized sample contain high-pressure strain effects, the aging effects on superconducting 
properties were observed in 10-years-old samples. As a conclusion, the BiS2-based compounds are 
stable and their superconducting properties are also robust to aging in air. However, the high-
pressure strain effects exhibit aging.
