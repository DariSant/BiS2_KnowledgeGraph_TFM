Abstract 
We have investigated the Se isotope effect in layered bismuth chalcogenide (BiCh2-based) 
superconductor LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 with 76Se and 80Se. For all examined samples, the Se 
concentration, which is linked to the superconducting properties, is successfully controlled 
within x = 1.09–1.14 in LaO0.6F0.4BiS2-xSex. From the magnetization and electrical resistivity 
measurements, changes in Tc are not observed for the LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 samples with 76Se and 
80Se isotopes. Our results suggest that pairing in the BiCh2-based superconductors is not 
mediated by phonons, and unconventional superconductivity states may emerge in the BiCh2 
layers of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2.

In most superconductors, electron–phonon interactions are responsible for the 
emergence of superconductivity [1]. According to the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) theory 
[1], the transition temperature (Tc) of a conventional superconductor is proportional to its 
phonon energy ħ, where ħ and  are the Planck constant and phonon frequency, respectively. 
Therefore, the Tc of conventional electron–phonon superconductors is sensitive to the isotope 
effect of the constituent elements. The isotope exponent  is defined by Tc ~ M-, where M is the 
isotope mass, and  ~ 0.5 is expected from the BCS theory [1]. Therefore, the isotope effect has 
been used to investigate whether the mechanisms of superconductors are conventional or 
unconventional. Indeed,  close to 0.5 has been reported in (Ba,K)BiO3 (O ~ 0.5) [2], doped 
fullerene (C ~ 0.4) [3], MgB2 (B ~ 0.3) [4], and Ni- and Pd-based borocarbides (B ~ 0.3) [5]. 
In superconductors with unconventional mechanisms, the isotope effect is not consistent with 
the expectation from the BCS theory. In the cuprate superconductor system,  deviates from 0.5 
and shows anomalous dependence on carrier concentration [6,7]. In the Fe-based 
superconductor, one research group reported Fe ~ 0.4 in SmFeAs(O,F) and (Ba,K)Fe2As2 [8], 
but another group reported an inverse isotope effect, negative Fe, for the same composition [9].  
In 2012, a new layered superconductor system with a BiS2 superconducting layer was 
discovered [10,11]. Since the crystal structure of BiS2-based superconductors resembled those 
of cuprate and Fe-based superconductors, researchers have explored new BiS2-based 
superconductors with higher Tc. Six typical superconductor systems with BiCh2-type (Ch: S, Se) 
superconducting layers and various kinds of blocking layers have been discovered, and the 
highest record of Tc is 11 K [12,13]. The pairing mechanisms of superconductivity in the 
BiCh2-based system have been unexplained [14]. In early theoretical calculations, conventional 
phonon-mediated pairing mechanisms were proposed [15]. In addition, Raman scattering, 
muon-spin spectroscopy measurements (SR), and thermal conductivity experiments suggested 
conventional mechanisms with a fully gapped s-wave [16-18]. However, recent theoretical 
calculations indicated that Tc with the order of several to 10 K in the BiS2-based superconductor 
cannot be explained within existing conventions [19]. Furthermore, angle-resolved 
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) proposed unconventional pairing mechanisms owing to 
the observation of the highly anisotropic superconducting gap in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 [20]. 
Therefore, we have demonstrated the isotope effect in a BiCh2-based system La(O,F)Bi(S,Se)2. 
On the target phase of this study, our recent studies on LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 revealed 
that the emerging superconducting states in this Se-substituted system are quite homogeneous 
owing to the enhanced in-plane chemical pressure effect and the suppressed local in-plane 
disorder [21-23]; local in-plane disorder can intrinsically exist in the BiCh2-based system owing 
to Bi lone pair electrons [24]. In addition, Tc in the LaO1-xFxBiSSe does not change for x = 0.2–
0.5, indicating that Tc is insensitive to electron doping amount in this region. Among those, the 


3 
 
sample with x = 0.4 shows the sharpest superconducting transition [23]. Based on these facts, 
we choose the nominal composition of LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe to use in the isotope experiments. Since 
there is no stable isotope of Bi other than 209Bi, and Bi is too heavy for the precise investigation 
of the isotope effect, we used 76Se and 80Se isotopes. The superconductivity in BiCh2-based 
systems emerges in the BiCh plane, and the conduction band is composed of Bi-6p orbitals 
hybridized with Ch-p orbitals [14,25]. In the present system, Se selectively occupies the 
in-plane site [23]. Therefore, the lattice vibration of Bi and Se should be responsible for the 
superconductivity, if the conventional phonon-mediated mechanisms are working. The Se 
isotope effect should then be observed in LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe if phonon-mediated. Assuming  Se = 
0.5 ( expected from BCS theory) and Tc ~ 3.8 K [23], the difference in Tc (Tc) is expected to 
be 0.098 K between the samples with 76Se and 80Se. When  Se = 0.2 and 0.3, which is close to 
the values observed in MgB2 and borocarbide, Tc is expected to be 0.039 and 0.059 K, 
respectively. Therefore, before synthesizing isotope samples, we optimized the synthesis 
procedure of the polycrystalline LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe samples using conventional Se powders to 
investigate very small Tc between 76Se and 80Se.  
As a result of the isotope-effect study, we found that the changes in Tc between the 
76Se and 80Se samples, estimated from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements, are 
apparently smaller than that expected from phonon-mediated mechanisms. Our results suggest 
that pairing in the BiCh2-based superconductors is not mediated by phonons, and 
unconventional superconductivity may emerge in the BiCh2 layer. 
Polycrystalline samples with a starting nominal composition of LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe were 
prepared by a solid-state-reaction method. Powders of La2S3 (99.9%), La2O3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 
(99.99%), BiF3 (99.9%), and Bi (99.999%) gains were used. Powders of Se isotopes 76Se 
(99.80%) and 80Se (99.91%) were purchased from ISOFLEX. The powders with the starting 
nominal composition of LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe were mixed using a mortar, pressed into pellets, sealed 
into an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700 ºC for 20 h. The product was ground, mixed for 
homogenization, pressed into pellets, and annealed in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 ºC for 20 
h. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected by a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer with Cu-Kα 
radiation using the 2-method with a range of 210–120°. The obtained X-ray patterns 
were refined using the Rietveld method [26]. To obtain better refinement, a secondary phase of 
BiF3, typically 3% mass fraction, was included in the refinements. In addition, very small 
impurity peaks, possibly LaS, were observed in the diffraction patterns. In the Rietveld 
refinements, occupancy at the O/F site was fixed at O0.6F0.4 because O and F cannot be reliably 
refined using X-ray diffraction data. Isotropic displacement parameters were fixed as the values 
obtained from the refinement of the synchrotron XRD data [23]. A schematic image of the 
crystal structure was captured using VESTA [27]. The temperature dependence of magnetization 


4 
 
was measured after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) using a 
superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 
20 Oe by a Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS-3). The onset Tc in the 
magnetization measurements was defined using a cross point of two linear fitting lines as shown 
in Fig. 2b–e. The irreversible temperature Tirr was defined as the temperature at which the 
difference between ZFC and FC curves emerged. The temperature dependence of electrical 
resistivity was measured using a four-terminal method with a current of 1 mA by a Physical 
Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design). The Tc in the electrical resistivity 
measurements was defined as the temperature where zero-resistivity state was observed. To 
precisely discuss the isotope effect, we have compared the resistivity transitions for three 
samples measured together on the same sample pack. 
As seen in Fig. 1, using Rietveld refinement of the X-ray diffraction pattern, we 
confirmed that the obtained samples were structurally comparable in regard to impurity amount, 
lattice constant, and chalcogen (S/Se) concentration, as listed in Table 1. After Rietveld 
refinements, we found that the actual Se concentration was slightly larger than that of S in the 
obtained samples. Particularly, Se concentration (x) affects the superconducting properties in 
LaO0.6F0.4BiS2-xSex; hence, we compare the superconducting properties of x = 1.09–1.14 only, to 
precisely discuss the isotope effects. The detailed information about crystal structure parameters 
is summarized in Table 1. Here, we show the superconducting properties of two samples with 
76Se, labelled as 76Se–#1 and 76Se–#2, and two samples with 80Se, labelled as 80Se–#1 and 80Se–
#2. 
Figure 2(a) and 2(b) show the temperature dependences of magnetization for the 76Se–
#1, 76Se–#2, 80Se–#1, and 80Se–#2 samples. For all samples, a sharp transition and a large 
diamagnetic signal are observed. The enlarged figures of the magnetization around the 
superconducting transition are displayed in Fig. 2(c–f). Surprisingly, the onset Tc does not 
change within 0.01 K for all samples. The onset Tc is estimated as 3.77, 3.76, 3.76, and 3.77 K 
for 76Se–#1, 76Se–#2, 80Se–#1, and 80Se–#2, respectively. In addition, irreversible temperature 
Tirr, defined as the temperature at which the difference between ZFC and FC curves emerged 
and corresponding to the emergence of the superconducting current path, is estimated to be the 
same, Tirr = 3.74 K. Figure 3 shows the temperature dependences of normalized electrical 
resistivity [(T) / (4 K)] for 76Se–#1, 80Se–#1 and 80Se–#2, which were measured together on 
the same sample pack. The resistivity data was normalized using resistivity at 4 K for 
comparison of Tc. The Tc is estimated as 3.73, 3.73, and 3.72 K for 76Se–#1, 80Se–#1 and 80Se–
#2, respectively.  
Based on the observed Tc in the magnetization and electrical resistivity, we conclude 
that Se in LaO0.6F0.4BiS2-xSex with x = 1.09–1.14 is very close to zero. According to our 


5 
 
Rietveld analyses (see Table 1), the Ch1 site (in-plane site) is almost completely occupied with 
Se: Se occupancy at the Ch1 site is 95–99%. Therefore, phonons, at least in-plane phonons, 
should not be responsible for pairing in the superconductivity of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2. This 
conclusion is consistent with the theoretical calculations by Morice et al. [19]. Although the 
pairing mechanisms for the superconductivity of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 cannot be completely 
clarified with the present isotope effect only, we briefly discuss the possibility of 
unconventional superconductivity. As mentioned above, unconventional mechanisms in the 
BiCh2-based superconductor family have been proposed by several theoretical and experimental 
studies [19,20,28-30]. Particularly, the ARPES experiment observed the existence of accidental 
nodes in nodal s-wave symmetry and proposed several possibilities of unconventional pairing 
mechanisms with competition or cooperation among multiple pairing interactions, such as 
phonon, charge, and spin fluctuations [20]. Indeed, from neutron diffraction and pair density 
function analysis, the importance of charge fluctuation to the superconductivity of La(O,F)BiS2 
has been proposed [29]. In addition, pairing mechanisms mediated by orbital fluctuation is also 
possible. Since our isotope effect indicates that phonon is not essential for superconductivity, 
the mechanisms that are purely electronic or dominated by electronic contribution would drive 
the superconductivity in LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2. Our present results for the Se isotope effect on Tc 
of LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 should be an important step to clarify the mechanisms for the 
superconductivity of BiCh2-based layered superconductors. 
In conclusion, we have investigated the isotope effect on Tc of BiCh2-based layered 
superconductor LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 using 76Se and 80Se isotopes. Comparing the transition 
temperatures investigated from magnetization and electrical resistivity measurements, we have 
revealed that the exponent Se is close to zero. Our results suggest that the pairing in the 
LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2 superconductor is not mediated by phonons, and unconventional 
superconductivity may emerge in the BiCh2 layer. To completely exclude the phonon-mediated 
mechanisms, we have to examine the S isotope effect for the same composition 
(LaO0.6F0.4Bi(S,Se)2) and for a system with a pure BiS2 layer, such as Nd(O,F)BiS2 with a higher 
Tc of 5 K.
