Abstract 
 We have investigated the thermoelectric properties of the novel layered bismuth 
chalcogenides LaOBiS2-xSex. The partial substitution of S by Se produced the 
enhancement of electrical conductivity (metallic characteristics) in LaOBiS2-xSex. The 
power factor largely increased with increasing Se concentration. The highest power 
factor was 4.5 W/cmK2 at around 470 ºC for LaOBiS1.2Se0.8. The obtained 
dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) was 0.17 at around 470 ºC in LaOBiS1.2Se0.8.

 Discovery of novel thermoelectric materials with a high performance is one of the most 
important issues for the development of thermoelectric application [1]. In recent years, 
researchers have focused on layered materials as candidates of a novel thermoelectric 
material because their low-dimensional crystal structure and electronic states can 
produce a high thermoelectric property as realized in Bi2Te3, cobalt oxides and CsBi4Te6 
[2-4]. 
 Since 2012, layered compounds with the BiS2 layers have got much attention in the 
field of condensed matter physics due to the discovery of superconductivity with a 
transition temperature as high as 11 K in Bi4O4S3 [5], REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, 
Nd and Yb) [6-12] and AE1-xRExFBiS2 (AE = Sr and Eu) [13-16]. Their crystal structure 
is basically composed of alternate stacks of the conduction layer (BiS2 layer) and the 
blocking layer such as REO layer. In the BiS2-based materials, the Bi-6p orbitals within 
the BiS2 layer are essential for electronic conduction. It has been revealed that the 
electronic states are easily tunable by element substitutions at the blocking layers. 
Having considered the low-dimensional crystal structure and electronic states, we have 
regarded the layered bismuth chalcogenides as potential thermoelectric materials. 
 In the previous study, we investigated physical properties of the BiS2-based layered 
compounds LaO1-xFxBiS2 at high temperatures [17]. We observed an anomalous metallic 
behavior in LaOBiS2: a metal-semiconductor transition was revealed at around 270 K. 
The highest power factor of 1.9 W/cmK2 at ~480 ºC was observed for LaOBiS2. In 
addition, we investigated the effect of F substitution (electron doping) on the power 
factor in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Although the electrical conductivity increases by the partial 
substitution of O by F, the Seebeck coefficient largely decreases. Hence, the F 
substitution resulted in a decrease of power factor. This result suggests that the 
element substitution at the blocking layer negatively works in enhancing thermoelectric 
properties. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of element substitution at the 
BiS2 conduction layer on thermoelectric properties of LaOBiS2. Here, we report a large 
enhancement of the power factor and the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) by a partial 
substitution of S by Se in LaOBiS2-xSex. On the basis of the systematic changes in lattice 
constants, we have considered that the S and Se ions are mixed as shown in Fig. 1(a). 
The partial Se substitution achieves both metallic conductivity and a large Seebeck 
coefficient in LaOBiS2-xSex. 
 
 Polycrystalline samples of LaOBiS2-xSex were prepared by the solid-state reaction 
method using powders of La2S3 (99.9 %), La2O3 (99.9 %), Bi2S3, Bi2Se3 and grains of Bi 
(99.999 %). The Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 powders were synthesized by reacting Bi, S (99.99 %) 


3 
 
or Se (99.99 %) grains in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals were purchased 
from Kojundo-Kagaku Laboratory. The mixture of starting materials with nominal 
compositions of LaOBiS2-xSex (x = 0, 0.2, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0) was mixed-well, pelletized and 
sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The samples were heated at 700 ºC for 15 h. The 
obtained products were ground, pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and 
heated under the same heating conditions for homogenization. The prepared samples 
were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) with a CuK radiation using the 
-2 method.  
 The XRD patterns of the typical LaOBiS2-xSex samples (x = 0 and 1.0) are shown in Fig. 
1(b). Almost single-phase samples were obtained for x = 0 - 1.0, except for a small 
amount of La-oxide impurities as indicated by asterisk in the XRD pattern. The 
numbers in the XRD pattern is Miller indices with the space group of P4/nmm. 
Although we attempted to prepare the samples with x = 1.5 and 2.0, single-phase 
samples were not obtained probably due to the existence of a solubility limit of Se for 
the S site in LaOBiS2-xSex. The lattice constants of a and c were calculated using the 
peak positions of the (200) and (003) peaks, and plotted in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. 
We have corrected the peak positions using the corrected data obtained from the peak 
position of Si [14]. Both the lattice constants of a and c increase with increasing Se 
concentration. The increase of lattice volume can be understood by the difference in the 
ionic radius of S2- and Se2-. 
 
 The electrical resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient were measured by the 
four-terminal method using ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 up to 480 ºC in an atmosphere of 
low-pressure He gas. The measurements of the thermal conductivity () was conducted 
at temperatures up to 400 ºC using a lamp heating unit (Ulvac, MILA-5000). The  was 
obtained from the slopes of the plots of heat flux density vs. T using a strain gauge as a 
heater and was measured under pressures less than 10−3 Pa. The heat loss by radiation 
through the samples [18] was subtracted under the assumption that emissivity is 
independent of temperature and wavelength during the measurements of . The 
emissivity of 0.8 was employed on the basis of reflectivity measurements, which were 
performed at room temperature using a spectrometer equipped with an integrating 
sphere (Hitachi High-tech, U-4100). The relative density of the sintered pellet used in 
these measurements is ~85 % (84 % for x = 0 and 91 % for x = 1.0). 
The power factor was calculated using an equation P = S2/, where S and  are Seebeck 
coefficient and electrical resistivity, respectively. The dimensionless figure-of-merit was 
calculated using an equation of ZT = P T / , where  and T are thermal conductivity 


4 
 
and absolute temperature, respectively. 
 Figure 2(a) shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for 
LaOBiS2-xSex. An anomaly is observed at around 400 ºC for x = 0.2, which is similar to 
those observed at around 200 ºC in x = 0 (LaOBiS2) and F-doped LaOBiS2 [17]. The 
anomaly may be related to a charge-density-wave transition, which was recently 
observed in EuFBiS2 [16]. In the temperature dependences for x = 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0, 
metallic behavior is observed without any anomalies below 480 ºC. With increasing Se 
concentration, the values of electrical resistivity systematically decrease, indicating 
that the Se substitution enhances metallic characteristics. The value of electrical 
resistivity at around 470 ºC for LaOBiSSe (x = 1.0) is ~4.7 mcm, which is clearly lower 
than that for LaOBiS2 (x = 0) (~21 mcm) [17]. To clarify the mechanism of the 
enhancement of electrical conductivity by Se substitution, investigations with single 
crystals and band calculations are needed. 
 Figure 2(b) shows the temperature dependences of Seebeck coefficient for LaOBiS2-xSex. 
All the samples show negative Seebeck coefficient, indicating that the contributing 
carrier is basically electron. The absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient tends to 
increase with increasing temperature for all the samples. Although the absolute values 
of Seebeck coefficient decrease with increasing Se concentration, the values at around 
470 ºC for x = 0.8 and 1.0 are still around -150 V/K, which is a relatively high value as 
a metallic compound. 
 The obtained power factors are plotted in Fig. 2(c) as a function of temperature. The 
values of power factor are largely enhanced by Se substitution. For x = 0.2 and 0.6, the 
temperature dependence of power factor shows a maximum at around 200 - 300 ºC. For 
x = 0.8 and 1.0, the values of power factor monotonously increase with increasing 
temperature within a range of T < 480 ºC. The highest power factor is 4.5 W/cmK2 at 
around 470 ºC for x = 1.0 (LaOBiSSe). This value is 237 % of the highest value obtained 
in LaOBiS2. 
Finally, we discuss the thermoelectric performance of the LaOBiS2-xSex system. In 
order to calculate the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT), we have measured thermal 
conductivity for the end members (x = 0 and 1.0). Figure 3(a) shows the temperature 
dependences of thermal conductivity for x = 0 and 1.0. It is found that the thermal 
conductivity for LaOBiS2-xSex is almost independent of temperature. Furthermore, the 
obtained values of thermal conductivity are almost the same for LaOBiS2 and 
LaOBiSSe, indicating that the partial substitution of S by Se does not affect the thermal 
conductivity in this system. In general, electronic thermal conductivity increases with 
enhancing metallic characteristics. On another front, the phonon thermal conductivity 


5 
 
could decrease by substituting the chalcogen site in LaOBiS2-xSex due to introduction of 
the randomness. Hence, it is considered that the total thermal conductivity does not 
change with increasing Se concentration because of the compensation of the changes in 
the electron thermal conductivity and the phonon thermal conductivity. Therefore, we 
use a typical (average) value of 2 W/m·K, which is the value estimated at room 
temperature for LaOBiS2 and LaOBiSSe, to estimate ZT. This  value is consistent with 
that reported in the previous study on low-temperature thermal properties of LaOBiS2 
[19]. The temperature dependences of dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) for 
LaOBiS2-xSex are plotted in Fig. 3(b). For all the samples, the value of ZT tends to 
increase with increasing temperature, and it reaches a maximum value at around 470 
ºC, which is the measurement limit of the present work. This fact indicates that the 
LaOBiS2-xSex system is a potential thermoelectric material for the use at high 
temperatures. The highest value of ZT is 0.17 for x = 0.8 (LaOBiS1.2Se0.8) at 470 ºC. To 
further increase the thermoelectric performance in this family, precise tuning of carrier 
concentration and/or local crystal structure are needed. In this family, partial 
substitutions at the blocking layer can tune both the carrier concentration within the 
conduction layers and the local structure that largely affects the physical properties [6, 
17, 20]. Therefore, a strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance of this system 
will be tuning of the structure of the blocking layer. 
 
 In conclusion, we have synthesized polycrystalline samples of novel layered bismuth 
chalcogenides LaOBiS2-xSex and systematically investigated thermoelectric properties. 
It was found that a partial substitution of S by Se enhanced metallic conductivity. The 
power factor largely increased with increasing Se concentration. The highest power 
factor was 4.5 W/cmK2 at around 470 ºC for LaOBiS1.2Se0.8. We found that the thermal 
conductivity for LaOBiS2-xSex is independent of both temperature and Se concentration. 
Using an average value of thermal conductivity, 2 W/m·K, we calculated the 
dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) as a function of temperature. The highest ZT was 
0.17 at around 470 ºC in LaOBiS1.2Se0.8. Optimization of the carrier concentration 
and/or the local structure will further enhance the thermoelectric performance of the 
layered bismuth chalcogenides.
