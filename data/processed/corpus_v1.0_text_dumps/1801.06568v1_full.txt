Layered LnOBiS2 compounds with Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Yb can be rendered conducting and
superconducting via two routes, substitution of F for O or the tetravalent ions Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th
for trivalent Ln ions. Electrical resistivity measurements on non-ﬂuorinated La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 and
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 superconductors were performed between ∼1.5 K and 300 K and under pressure
up to 2.4 GPa. For both compounds, the superconducting transition temperature Tc, which is ∼2.9
K at ambient pressure, gradually increases with pressure to 3.2-3.7 K at ∼1 GPa, above which it is
suppressed and the superconducting transitions become very broad. Measurements of the normal
state electrical resistivity of the two compounds reveal discontinuous changes of the resistivity as
a function of pressure at ∼0.6 GPa, above which metallic-like electrical conduction is suppressed
with increasing pressure. Surprisingly, above 1.3 GPa, semiconducting-like behavior reappears in
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2. This study reveals a new high-pressure phase of La1−xM xOBiS2 containing the
tetravalent ions M = Ti, Th which does not favor superconductivity. In contrast, application of
pressure to ﬂuorinated LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 produces an abrupt tetragonal-monoclinic transition to a
metallic phase with an enhanced Tc. These results demonstrate that the response of the normal
and superconducting properties of LaOBiS2-based compounds depends strongly on the atomic site
where the electron donor ions are substituted.

INTRODUCTION
Following the discovery of superconductivity in the lay-
ered bismuth oxysulﬁde compound Bi4O4S3, an intense
eﬀort to ﬁnd new BiS2-based superconductors quickly en-
sued as a result of the remarkable ﬂexibility of the BiS2-
layers in forming compounds with new chemical compo-
sitions [1–4]. By doping the BiS2-layers with electrons
via appropriate chemical substitutions, superconductiv-
ity was found in Ln(O, F)BiS2 (Ln = La-Nd, Yb), (Sr,
La)FBiS2, (La, M )OBiS2 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf, Th), Bi3O2S3,
La(O, F)BiSe2, EuBiS2F, and Eu3Bi2S4F4 with values
of the superconducting transition temperature Tc rang-
ing from 2.7 to 10.6 K [2, 5–11]. One of the fascinat-
ing features in the behavior of several of the BiS2-based
superconductors, including LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La-
Nd, Yb), (La,Sm)O0.5F0.5BiS2, Sr0.5R0.5FBiS2 (R = La-
Pr, Sm), LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2, and EuBiS2F, is the pressure-
induced enhancement of Tc that occurs at about 0.5-2.2
GPa, revealing the existence of two distinct supercon-
ducting phases [12–18]. This phenomenon is believed to
be associated with a structural phase transition, which
has been demonstrated in the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2,
from a tetragonal structure to a monoclinic structure
with a sudden change in unit cell volume at an exter-
nal pressure (P) of ∼0.5 GPa [19].

In addition to the requisite superconducting BiS2 lay-
ers, there are other similarities in the compounds re-
ported to have a second superconducting phase under
high pressure: 1) all of these compounds contain F, which
resides in blocking layers and donates conduction elec-
trons to the BiS2 layers, and 2) the high pressure phase
has a signiﬁcantly larger value of Tc than the low pressure
phase. These similarities raise the issue of whether F is
essential for the formation of the pressure-induced high-
Tc phase.
Recently, superconductivity was also found
in single crystalline CeOBiS2 at 1.3 K, and the value
of Tc could be gradually enhanced under an external
pressure [20].
This phenomenon was suggested to be
related to Ce valence ﬂuctuations, which can be tuned
via the application of pressure; however, it is still not
clear if there are concomitant phase transitions.
On
the other hand, the compounds La1−xM xOBiS2 (M =
Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) were reported to have the same crys-
tal structure, very similar lattice parameters, and val-
ues of Tc (∼3 K) similar to that of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [21].
The M ions in La1−xM xOBiS2 are tetravalent and con-
tribute conduction electrons to the BiS2 layers in the
absence of F; hence, this system is ideal for investigat-
ing whether non-F substituted BiS2 compounds have a
second pressure-induced high Tc phase.
High pressure
studies of La1−xM xOBiS2 also have the potential of un-
covering new superconducting phases in BiS2-based su-
perconductors and will be very helpful in developing an
understanding of the nature of the pressure-induced low-
Tc to high-Tc phase transition in these materials.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS
Polycrystalline
samples
of
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2
and
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 were synthesized by solid state re-
action as described elsewhere [21].
Geometric factors
used in determining the electrical resistivity for each
sample were measured before applying pressure. Hydro-
static pressure was generated by using a clamped piston-
cylinder cell (PCC) in which a 1:1 mixture of n-pentane
and isoamyl alcohol by volume was used as the pressure-
transmitting medium. The pressures applied to the sam-
ples were estimated by measuring the Tc of a high pu-
rity (>99.99%) Sn disk inside the sample chamber of the
cell and comparing the measured values with the well-
determined Tc(P) of high purity Sn [22]. Electrical resis-
tance measurements under high pressure up to ∼2.4 GPa
were performed in a temperature range between 1.5 and
280 K using a standard four-probe method in a pumped
4He dewar.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The resistive superconducting transition curves ρ(T),
normalized to the value of ρ in the normal state
at 4.2 K, for polycrystalline La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 and
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 samples are shown in the upper and
lower panels of Fig. 1, respectively. The superconduct-
ing transitions are very sharp for pressures below 0.95
GPa for both samples; however, the transitions become
quite broad at higher pressures and the values of ρ re-
main ﬁnite down to 1.5 K. The relationship between Tc
and pressure for the two compounds can be seen in Fig.
2. Tc99%, Tc90%, Tc50%, and Tc10% represent the tem-
peratures where ρ falls to 99%, 90%, 50%, and 10% of
its normal-state value, respectively. The value of Tc99%
is 3.5 K for La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 at ambient pressure and
increases slightly with increasing pressure to 3.7 K at
0.95 GPa, above which Tc99% starts decreasing gradu-
ally.
A similar dome-shaped Tc vs.
P superconduct-
ing phase boundary can also be observed in the case of
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2, although the values of Tc are slightly
diﬀerent than those of La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2. For both com-
pounds, the diﬀerence between Tc99% and Tc90% (indi-
cated by the green vertical lines in Fig.
2), which is
related to the width of superconducting transition, be-
comes much larger at pressures at which Tc starts de-
creasing (0.95 GPa), reﬂecting dramatic changes in the
superconductivity. During the pressure releasing cycle,
the values of Tc are reversible and the superconducting
transitions become sharp again when the samples have
returned to low pressures as can be seen in Figs. 1 and
2 (data represented by crosses). These features in the Tc
vs. P data indicate that there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences
in the superconducting behavior below and above 0.95
GPa.

the suppression of superconductivity at high pressure,

we investigated the normal state resistivity of the two
compounds under pressure.
Upon warming, ρ(T) of
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 ﬁrst decreases signiﬁcantly, passes
through a minimum, and then increases nearly linearly
at higher temperatures, as shown in Fig.3. Such min-
ima in the normal state resistivity are also observed for
La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 under pressure and other BiS2-based
superconductors [10, 12, 21, 23, 24]. In addition, sub-
tle anomalies in resistivity, indicated by black arrows in
Fig.
3, were observed in both compounds when pres-
sure was applied to the samples. Upon further increase
in pressure, the temperature at which the anomaly dis-
plays a kink (Ta) increases with increasing pressure (see
the lower inset of Fig. 3); however, at pressures above
0.42 GPa, such anomalies in ρ(T) can no longer be ob-
served. Very recently, a similar kink in ρ(T) was reported
in non-superconducting LaOBiSe2 at ambient pressure,

which may related to a charge density wave transition
and can be suppressed by F substitution [25].
In this
study, the appearance of these anomalies is possibly due
to a temperature-driven phase transition; however, the
nature of the transition will require further investigation.
In this work, we use the parameter a(T), which rep-
resents the slope of ρ(T), (dρ/dT), at a certain temper-
ature to characterize the tendency of the compound to
exhibit metallic- or semiconducting-like behavior.
For
simple metals at high temperatures, a is closely related
to the scattering of conduction electrons by phonons. Al-
though the value of a does not have a clear physical signif-
icance for semiconductors, a positive value of a suggests
that the sample is metallic-like and a negative value of a
means it is semiconducting-like. In this work, the quan-

tity a(T) describes the tendency of the compounds to
exhibit metallic- or semiconducting-like behavior at dif-
ferent pressures. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the values of a
at ∼10 K (a10 K) for the two compounds are negative at
ambient pressure, suggesting semiconducting-like behav-
ior at low temperatures. Upon application of an external
pressures, a10 K ﬁrst increases rapidly at low pressures
but relatively moderately at high pressures, resulting in
a kink in the pressure dependence of a10 K at ∼0.7 GPa.
Although the values of a10 K are all negative at pressures
up to 2.4 GPa, the increase of a10 K with pressure clearly
indicates suppression of the semiconducting-like behav-
ior. The kinks in a10 K(P) found at ∼0.7 GPa suggests
there are some fundamental diﬀerences between behavior
of the two compounds at low and high pressure, which
are consistent with the decrease of Tc and broadening
of the superconducting transitions at high pressure dis-
cussed previously.

squares), respectively.
The open circles indicate that the
values are negative, suggesting semiconducting-like behavior.
Dashed lines are guides to the eye.
Although the pressure dependences of a at low temper-
ature are quite similar for the two compounds, the values
of a at 250 K (a250 K) for La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 are positive
and almost the same at low pressures, in contrast to the
remarkable enhancement of a250 K from negative to pos-
itive values in the case of La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 as shown in
Fig. 4(b). As indicated by the dashed lines in Fig. 4(b),
the pressure dependence of a250 K dramatically decreases
at higher pressures for both compounds, which suggests
not only pressure-induced suppression of metallic-like be-
havior at high temperatures for the two compounds but
also indicates the appearance of high pressure phases that
exhibit diﬀerent types of electronic conduction compared
to the corresponding low pressure phases. It should be
noted that the values of a250 K for La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 are
even negative above 1.3 GPa, indicating the reappear-
ance of semiconducting-like behavior.
Either the suppression of metallic conductivity or reap-
pearance of semiconducting-like behavior is unusual for
solids under pressure, since applying external pressures
usually results in a signiﬁcant increase in the carrier den-
sity. For a better understanding of the normal state re-
sistivity, we plotted representative ρ at 4.2 K (ρ4.2 K) vs.

observed that ρ4.2 K for both compounds is signiﬁcantly
suppressed when pressure is ﬁrst applied, which can be
easily understood due to the increase of the electron den-
sity under pressures. With further increase in pressure,
however, ρ4.2 K of La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 subtly increases and
ρ4.2 K of La0.85Ti0.15OBiS2 decreases very slightly, result-
ing in kinks in ρ4.2 K(P) at ∼0.6 GPa, as indicated by
the arrows in Fig. 5. Consistent with previous discus-
sions about the behavior of superconductivity and a un-
der pressure, a diﬀerent phase whose normal state resis-
tivity exhibits an unusual response to pressure appears
at high pressures above ∼0.6 GPa.
As mentioned in the introduction, all of the BiS2-based
superconductors which were reported to show pressure-
induced low-Tc to high-Tc phase transitions contain F.
The previous study of Sm substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2
suggested that the pressure dependences of Tc in BiS2-
based superconductors are closely related to the lattice
parameter a rather than the chemical composition of the
blocking layers [12]. In this study, although phase tran-
sitions were clearly observed in La0.80Ti0.20OBiS2 and
La0.85Th0.15OBiS2 via investigations of the behavior of
both the superconducting transitions and normal state
resistivity under pressure, the high pressure phases of
the two compounds are apparently unfavorable for su-
perconductivity. The results indicate that F in the block-
ing layer of BiS2-based compounds plays a critical role of
not only providing conduction electrons but also the sud-
den pressure-induced enhancement of superconductivity.
This is presumably associated with a structural phase
transition from tetragronal to orthorhombic symmetry,
as has been shown for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2.
One may notice that although superconductivity is
suppressed and ρ remains ﬁnite to 1.5 K, the decrease
of ρ signaling the appearance of superconducting cur-
rents can still be observed up to the highest pressure
obtained in this study.
For homogeneous samples, in


5
general, pressure-induced phase transitions (either struc-
tural or electronic, ﬁrst or second order) usually occur in
a rather narrow hydrostatic pressure range. The abrupt
changes in normal state resistivity presented in this study
also suggest the phase transition should be complete be-
fore 1 GPa; this raises the question of why the supercon-
ducting transitions of the two compounds remain broad
at pressures above 1 GPa. It is possible that the high
pressure phase is not superconducting and the supercon-
ducting currents observed above ∼1 GPa are associated
with small regions of the low-pressure phase that remain
at high pressure due to slight inhomogeneities in the sam-
ples. However, the possibility that the high pressure state
of the compounds is still superconducting at lower tem-
perature cannot be ruled out. Further studies need to
be performed to determine whether the compounds are
superconducting at lower temperatures.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
In summary, the observed phenomena including sup-
pression and broadening of the superconducting transi-
tion, changes of the normal state resistivity with pres-
sure, and the dramatic changes in the normal state
electron conduction behavior between 0.42-0.95 GPa
strongly suggest a pressure-induced phase transition in
the La1−xM xOBiS2 compounds.
In contrast to the
pressure-induced low-Tc to high Tc phase transitions re-
ported in F-containing BiS2 superconductors, the high-
pressure phase observed in this work does not favor su-
perconductivity. The results suggest that ﬂuorine plays
a critical role for the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc
for BiS2-based compounds. For the low-pressure phase,
anomalies in the normal state resistivity, which seem to
be pressure dependent, were observed in the pressure
range from 0.24 to 0.45 GPa.
Another unusual phe-
nomenon observed in this study is the tendency toward
more semiconducting behavior with increasing pressure
in the high-pressure phase. Further studies of these un-
usual phenomena are expected to enrich our understand-
ing of the physics of solids at high-pressure.
