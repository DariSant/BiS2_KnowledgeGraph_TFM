dimensional stacking sequences of two-dimensional BiS2 layers

Abstract  
LaOBiS2-type materials have drawn much attention recently because of various 
interesting physical properties, such as low-temperature superconductivity, hidden spin 
polarization, and electrically tunable Dirac cones. However, it was generally assumed 
that each LaOBiS2-type compound has a unique and specific crystallographic structure 
(with a space group P4/nmm) separated from other phases. Using first-principles total 
energy and stability calculations we confirm that the previous assignment of the 
centrosymetric P4/nmm structure to LaOBiS2 is incorrect as a phonon instability renders 
this structure impossible. Furthermore, we find that the unstable structure is replaced by a 
family of energetically closely spaced modifications (polytypes) differing by the layer 
sequences and orientations. We find that the local Bi-S distortion leads to three polytypes 
of LaOBiS2 with different stacking patterns of the distorted BiS2 layers. The energy 
difference between the polytypes of LaOBiS2 is merely ~1 meV/u.c., indicating the 
possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real sample and that the particular distribution 
of polytypes may be growth-induced. The in-plane distortion can be suppressed by 
pressure, leading to a phase transition from polytypes to the high-symmetry P4/nmm 
structure with a pressure larger than 2.5 GPa. In addition, different choices of the 
intermediate atoms (replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) could also manifest different 
ground state structures. One can thus tune the distortion and the ground state by pressure 
or substituting covalence atoms in LaOBiS2-family.

I. Introduction 
    LaOBiS2 represents a group of materials consisting of BiS2 layers whose states 
dominate the low-energy spectrum, separated by electronically passive La2O2 buffer 
layers. LaOBiS2-type materials have drawn attention because of the measured 
superconductivity1-14 (up to Tc = 10.6 K) and because the BiS2 layer is spin-orbit active 
and thus leads to many interesting spin-related properties, including hidden spin 
polarization15, spin field effect transistor16 and electrically tunable Dirac cones17. The 
general crystal structure consists of a stack of layers (BiS2)-/(La2O2)2+/(BiS2)- made of 
two BiS2 rocksalt-like layers and an intermediate fluorite-like La2O2 buffer layer 
separating them18. Many materials described by this structural scheme have recently been 
synthesized1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 14, and even more members not listed in inorganic compound 
data bases (ICSD) can be conceived17, 19. As with many other compounds, here too it was 
generally assumed that each compound has a unique and specific crystallographic 
structure separated from other phases. Using first-principles calculations we find that 
contrary to this view1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 18 the three-dimensional (3D) structure of this important 
family of compounds represents instead a family of energetically closely spaced 
modifications differing by the layer sequences and orientations. Such polytypes are 
“natural superlattices”, familiar from other areas in condensed matter such as SiC20, 21, 
ZnX (X = S, Se, Te)22-24, and ATiO3 (A = Sr and Ba) perovskites25, 26. Polytypes hold a 
special place as structural phases in that they have very similar (within meV) total 
energies, yet are distinguished by those physical properties that are sensitive to 
orientation and stacking such as polarization of light emission and sometimes the 
magnitude of the zone-folded band gap (for example, the optical band gap of cubic vs 
wurtzite polytype of SiC differ by nearly 1 eV29). What makes LaOBiS2 polytypes 
discovered here particularly interesting is that (i) the characteristic local structural 
distortions in the electronically active BiS2 layers could lead to charge fluctuations which 
may related to the electron-phonon coupling and the mechanism of superconductivity1, 30; 
and (ii) different polytypes are either centrosymmetric or noncentrosymetric, a distinction 
that carries with it different physical properties related to presence or absence of 
inversion symmetry, such as band splitting, second harmonic generation and (hidden) 
spin polarization15.

    In this article we use first-principles total energy calculations to assess the structure 
and stability of various polytypes in the LaOBiS2-family of compounds. We find that the 
local Bi-S distortion leads to three polytypes of LaOBiS2 according to the different 
stacking pattern of distorted BiS2 layers, rather than the previously assumed P4/nmm 
structure. The in-plane distortion is mainly induced by the interaction between the 
intermediate LaO and the BiS2 layers, and the electron hybridization in the BiS2 layer. 
We performed structural optimization in steps starting from the most restricted degrees of 
freedom to show how a small distortion can transform the assumed unstable structure to 
its three polytypes. Since the energy difference between the polytypes of LaOBiS2 is 
merely ~1 meV/u.c., the real 3D material constructed by stacking up such three types of 
building blocks could manifest various sequences of polytypes depending sensitively on 
the growth condition. Furthermore, the in-plane distortion can be suppressed by pressure, 
leading to a phase transition from polytypes to the high-symmetry P4/nmm structure with 
a pressure larger than 2.5 GPa. In addition, different choices of the buffer atoms 
(replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) manifest different ground state polytypes.  
 
II. The in-plane structure of the 2D BiS2-like layer and the emergence of possible 
stacking sequences 
LaOBiS218 has been generally accepted to have the ZrCuSiAs-type structure, with a 
centrosymmetric P4/nmm space group. X ray diffraction data was refined1, 6 by fitting the 
measured intensities to this structure type (named T0 hereafter). In T0 the BiS2 layers in 
the (BiS2)-/(La2O2)2+/(BiS2)- stacks have four equal Bi-S bonds, as shown in Fig. 1. 
However, recent phonon calculations using density functional theory (DFT) found that 
the T0 structure with assumed equal Bi-S bond lengths of 2.89 Å has soft phonons at the 
Brillouin zone center Γ point, which indicates dynamic instability and the theoretical 
impossibility of this T0 structure11 being stable. Yildirim showed that by shifting the S 
atoms along the diagonal of the 2D square (x or y direction in Fig. 1b), forming a 
ferroelectric-like distortion with two different in-plane Bi-S bonds (bond lengths 2.80 Å 
and 2.98 Å, see Fig. 1c) one can remove the dynamic instability. In this calculation a 
deformation parameter Q, which is defined by the normal modes having the unstable 
phonon was introduced to represent the in-plane displacement of S atoms. The total 


 
4 
energy was minimized with respect to Q, with the remaining structural degrees of 
freedom other than Q (such as lattice parameter and atomic positions) kept frozen at their 
Q = 0 value (corresponding to the T0 structure). A subsequent neutron powder diffraction 
experiment by Athauda et al.31 confirmed this predicted local distortion within a single 
BiS2 layer by observing indeed two different Bi-S bonds (with lengths of 2.68 Å and 3.11 
Å). We note that the powder diffraction also suggested another antiferroelectric-like 
distortion31, but such a mode is predicted to induce an instability at M point that is present 
in F-doped LaOBiS2 but absent in the parent compound, and is thus excluded by single 
crystal diffraction very recently32. 
However, the in-plane local distortions predicted11 and observed31 do not define as yet 
a 3D structure in LaOBiS2: there are two BiS2 layers in a unit cell, and one needs to 
construct a 3D model of how the various 2D layers are stacked so as to minimize the 
energy. Yildirim11 suggested a 3D structure that consists of two BiS2 layers having the 
same direction of  distortion (illustrated by the blue arrow shown in Fig. 1c) as a 
replacement of the unstable T0 structure. This ferroelectric-like structure removes the 
phonon instability and thus lowers the energy, turning the 3D structure into non-
centrosymmetric T1 (space group P21mn) from centrosymmetric T0 (P4/nmm)11. 
Interestingly, there are additional 3D stacking sequences of the 2D layers possible that 
were not previously examined in pristine LaOBiS2 (without doping) by aligning the in-
plane distortion in different directions. There are three possible stacking types that fulfill 
the local Bi-S1 distortion11, 31. In T1 type, the local distortions of two BiS2 layers are 
along x direction, in T2 they occur along x and –x direction, while in T3 are x and y 
direction. These distortions lower the system’s symmetry from P4/nmm (T0) to P21mn 
(T1), or P21m (T2) or C2 (T3). Among T1, T2, and T3, only T2 is centrosymmetric, whereas 
T1 and T3 are non-centrosymmetric. We next inquire as to the energetic order of stability 
of the different polytypes in LaOBiS2 as well as in other compounds from the same 
general family. 
  
III. Methods of calculation 
    The geometrical and electronic structures are calculated by the projector-augmented 
wave (PAW) pseudopotential33 and the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew, 


 
5 
Burke and Ernzerhof (PBE)34 to the exchange-correlation functional as implemented in 
the Vienna ab initio package (VASP)35. The plane wave energy cutoff is set to 550 eV. 
Electronic energy minimization was performed with a tolerance of 10−6 eV, and all 
atomic positions were relaxed with a tolerance of 10−3 eV/Å.  
    We note that PBE functional does not take the long-range van der Waals interaction 
into account, and thus usually overestimate the interlayer space. To overcome this, we 
also use PBE-D2 exchange-correlation functional, with the implementation of van der 
Waals (VDW) correction, to optimize the distorted structures (see Sec. VI). 
     
IV. Three levels of approximation for predicting bond relaxation and symmetry 
breaking   
    The three polytypes differ in the stacking direction of electronic-active BiS2 layers 
along the [001] direction. To gain insight into the various degrees of freedom we perform 
structural optimization in steps starting from the simplest and most restricted:  
    Approach (a): If one allows the T0 structure to relax but without imposing initially any 
symmetry breaking, only the a, c lattice vectors and four independent cell-internal atomic 
coordinate parameters (atomic positions of La, Bi, S1 and S2 sites along the c axis) can 
relax. This restricted relaxation is an artifact of the method of calculation, namely of 
assuming initially a high symmetry structure. It reflects the fact that the other degrees of 
freedom in T0 that could relax are not permitted to do so because a high symmetry (zero 
force on atoms) is artificially imposed. As a result, the final structure in this relaxation 
method still has the same space group P4/nmm as the initial starting point, denoted by the 
T0 point in Fig. 2. Although this is the only optimization treatment in most structure 
determination step in the DFT community, the result is incorrect because of the artificial 
restriction to high symmetry. 
    Approach (b): Next, we allow in-plane relaxation by initially lowering the symmetry 
but freeze all other degrees of freedom, while seeking the energy minimum under this 
constrain. To do so we start form T0 but shift S1 atom of each BiS2 layer along x or y 
direction, (depending on the T1-T3 type) and artificially keep all other structural degrees 
of freedom frozen. Such frozen Bi-S1 “bond length mismatch” distortion has been used 
by Ref. 11 for T1 and is defined by the S1 displacement Δ. This is not the most general 


 
6 
procedure, and is used here to observe what its physical consequence is. This simplified 
procedure of allowing just one mode to drive distortion is common in simple models of 
phase transitions. The results of this simplified model are the three curves in Fig. 2. They 
show that if one scans the energy as a function of Δ, each of these structures has different 
energy minima shown as solid dots in T1-T3 curves. This is clear evidence that in 
LaOBiS2 T0 structure is a saddle point and thus not able to exist stably.  
    Approach (c) – Most general: The in-plane Bi-S1 distortion can enable additional 
degrees of freedom, including the lattice parameters and atomic positions. For example, 
T1-type distortion will elongate the axis, while T2-type distortion will twist the 
rectangular x-z plane of the unit cell into a parallelogram. Therefore, in the most general 
approach (c) we further relax all degrees of freedom starting from the energy-minimum 
structures of T1-T3, and get three final structures that are several meV/unit cell (u.c.) 
lower in energy, T1
*, T2
* and T3
* indicated in Fig. 2 by diamond shapes. Unlike the T0 
structure, the T1
*, T2
* and T3
* structures are thermodynamically stable. We also 
considered full relaxation starting from a generic symmetry breaking of the T0 structure 
by randomly adding small distortions on both lattice vectors and atomic positions. We 
find from a few such starting points that the relaxed structures all become T1
*, T2
* or T3
* 
structure, indicating that T1
*-T3
* structure are the only three local minima around T0 
phase. 
    Comparision between different fully relaxed polytypes: Table I shows the total 
energy, space group, lattice parameter and Bi-S bond length of T0, T1
*-T3
* structure as 
well as the experimental refinement using T0 structure. Several observations are found: 
(i) Although T0 structure has a good agreement and a reasonable fit6 (R factor < 0.1) with 
experiment regarding the in-plane lattice constant, there is only one kind of Bi-S bond, 
which is inconsistent with the results by neutron diffraction31. On the other hand, all of 
T1
* to T3
* suggests two kinds of in-plane Bi-S1 bonds, with the bond lengths 2.76-2.77 
and 3.03-3.04 Å, respectively. These bond lengths agree with the experiments well31. (ii) 
With the presence of the in-plane distortion for T1
*-T3
* structures relative to T0, the 
buckling nature of the Bi-S1 plane is nearly unchanged. The calculated S1-Bi-S1 angle 
varies from 165° for T0 to 164° for all T1
*-T3
* structures, including one type of S1-Bi-S1 
angle in T1
* and T2
*, and two types in T3
*.  (iii) The T2
* structure is centrosymmetric and 


 
7 
has the lowest energy, but only 1-2 meV/u.c. lower than the non-centrosymmetric T1
* and 
T3
*. Such a small energy difference originates from the weak van der Waals interaction 
between adjacent BiS2 layers. The total energies of the polytypes are so close that 
theoretical stability could be significantly affected by the temperature or crystal growing 
conditions. On the other hand, T0 structure has the highest energy, about 10 meV/u.c. 
higher than T2
*.  
In order to visualize the transformation path from the saddle point T0 to the stable 
structures (e.g., T1
* or T2
*) in LaOBiS2, we show in Fig. 3 the feasibility of converting 
LaOBiS2 from T1
* to T2
* structure with T0 structure as an intermediate state. In T0 -> T1
* 
and T0 -> T2
* path we start from T0 structure and impose a tiny T1- or T2-type distortion 
on T0. Then we record each step of DFT relaxation process from T0 to T1
* (T2
*) as the 
reaction coordinate, i.e., the geometric parameter that changes during the conversion 
between T1
* and T2
*, by gradually changing the cell and the atomic position using 
conjugate gradient method. We find that T0 structure stays at a saddle point, so it is 
unstable and will spontaneously relax to a distorted structure T1
* or T2
* (also probably 
T3
*). On the other hand, the potential barrier between the transition of T1
* and T2
* 
structures is about 10 meV, which is not large enough to make T2
* as a unique structure. 
Instead, all T1
* to T3
* structures or their mixed phases are possible to happen in room 
temperature. 
 
V. Pressure-induced phase transition and polytypes in other LaOBiS2-type compounds  
    In order to unveil the physical origin of the polytypism, we investigated the ground-
state structure of LaOBiS2 under hydrostatic pressure. Figure 4(a) shows the in-plane 
distortion of T1-T3 structures presented by the Bi-S1 bond difference as a function of 
hydrostatic pressure. Zero pressure P = 0 corresponds to T1
*-T3
* structures with PBE-
calculated equilibrium lattice constant. We find that the pressure indeed suppresses the 
in-plane distortion for all T1-T3 structures. Above P = 2.5 GPa (corresponding an in-plane 
lattice constant a = b = 4.02 Å) the high-symmetry T0 structure becomes the ground state 
of LaOBiS2. 
    Following LaOBiS2, many compounds having similar structure are reported for the 
purpose of exploring the BiS2-based superconductivity7, 10. Therefore, it is interesting to 


 
8 
ask if the other compounds in this family also have such polytypes or not, and what 
determines T0 structure or distorted structures as a ground state. We substitute La (with 
Y), Bi (with Sb, As) or S (with Se, Te) site at one time and fix the other 3 sites the same 
as LaOBiS2. Figure 4(b) shows the relative energy of the polytypes of these materials. 
We found that when substituting La with lighter elements or substituting S with heavier 
elements, the undistorted T0 structures are the ground states, which means there is no 
polytypes in these materials. On the other hand, when substituting Bi with lighter 
elements Sb and As, T0 structures are no longer dynamic stable (dash lines), while 
distorted T1
*-T3
* are local minima. Among them T2
* is the ground state, with the total 
energy 10-15 meV lower than that of T1
*. The energy differences between T2
* and T0 for 
LaOSbS2 and LaOAsS2 are 167 and 718 meV, respectively, which is much larger than the 
counterpart of LaOBiS2. Moreover, the in-plane M-S1 bonds (M: Bi, Sb or As) also 
reveals that LaOSbS2 and LaOAsS2 suffer larger distortion. The two As-S1 bond lengths 
in LaOAsS2 are 2.43 Å and 3.31 Å. As a result, such large distortion breaks the 2D As-S 
square and forms individual zigzag As-S chains, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b).  
    From the study of pressure and various LaOBiS2-type compounds we conclude that the 
polytypism in LaOBiS2-family is mainly attributed to two reasons: the “substrate” effect 
of the intermediate layer (e.g., LaO) and hybridization effect of the active layer (e.g., 
BiS2).  In LaOMS2 compounds (M: Bi, Sb, As), the mismatch between the optimum 
lattice constants of LaO (larger) and MS2 (smaller) layers tends to stretch the M-S square 
and thus cause distortion. When the lattice of MS2 layers becomes smaller without 
changing LaO layer, the stretching effect becomes stronger. Interestingly, although this 
effect originates from the interaction between LaO and MS2 layers, the distortion in LaO 
layer is insignificant. It is because the bond energy of La-O is large so that the LaO 
network remains stable when suffering distortions. On the other hand, enlarging the 
lattice parameter of the side layer or reducing the lattice parameter of the intermediate 
layer induce better lattice match between side and intermediate layer so that the distortion 
is unlikely to happen, as the case in LaOBiSe2, LaOBiTe2 and YOBiS2. For LaOBiS2 
under pressure, the BiS2 and LaO layers are simultaneously compressed, in which case 
the enhanced Bi-S1 bond strength could stabilize the T0 structure and prevent distortion.  


 
9 
The other factor that can lead to distortion is within the local structure of the side layer. 
For the trend from Bi to As, the group-V cations behave more covalent character while 
less ionic character. As a result, they are inclined to form sp3 hybridization with 3 S 
atoms and the other bond is the lone-pair electron. The lone-pair bond usually has larger 
repulsive force than the other bonds, and thus breaks two M-S1 bonds to from zigzag 
chains.   
 
VI. The results of VDW correction 
    VDW interactions represent the interaction of an induced moment (dipole, 
quadropole, etc) with itself. This is strictly zero in mean field Hartree -Fock or DFT. 
From Table I we find that DFT without VDW gives the length of c axis (T0 and T1
*-T3
*) 
as 14.25 Å, much larger than the observed 13.83 Å. This is because the PBE functional 
didn’t take the long-range van der Waals interaction into account, and thus usually 
overestimate the interlayer space.  
   To overcome this, we also use PBE-D2 exchange-correlation functional that includes a 
rough VDW term to optimize the distorted structures. We find that the a and c axis of T0 
structure are 3.99 Å and 13.62 Å, respectively. Although PBE-D2 gives a better 
agreement with experiments on c axis (13.83 Å), it underestimate the a axis by 1.5% than 
that of experiments or PBE results (4.05 Å). More importantly, because of the biaxial 
strain effect within x-y plane under PBE-D2 method, the undistorted structure T0 
becomes the ground state. We performed the relaxation starting from the PBE relaxed 
T1
*-T3
* structure and find that the final configuration is the T0 structure. Phonon 
calculations of LaOBiS2 for smaller in-plane lattice parameters also suggested that the 
undistorted structure T0 is dynamic stable11. Since the accuracy of a axis is more 
important to investigate the in-plane distortion, we used PBE functional for the base of 
calculation and analysis.  
 
VII. Summary  
By using first-principles total energy and stability calculations, we predict that the 
local Bi-S distortion leads to three polytypes of LaOBiS2-type materials according to the 
different stacking pattern of BiS2-like layers. The in-plane distortion, mainly induced by 


 
10 
the interaction between the intermediate and the side layers and the electron hybridization 
in the side layer, can lower the total energy comparing with the conventional accepted 
P4/nmm structure. In LaOBiS2, the energy difference between the polytypes is small, 
indicating the possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real sample. While we cannot 
determine if the superposition is dynamic in nature (time-dependent doping, we note that 
such a superstructure with the combination of T1, T2 and T3 polytypes will effectively 
lower the symmetry to the P1 space group. Such a superstructure symmetry has been 
recently suggested by a single-crystal neutron-diffraction experiment of Athauda et al.32 
Finally, external pressure and different choices of the intermediate atoms (replacing La) 
or active atoms (BiS2) manifest different ground state polytypes. One can thus tune the 
distortion and the ground state by both physical and chemical means. Our findings 
provide a clear picture on the complexity of the crystal structure of LaOBiS2-type 
materials, which might be relevant to the mechanism of the recently found BiS2-based 
superconductivity.

Fig. 4: (a) The difference of bond length within Bi-S1 plane of distorted T1-T3 structures 
as a function of hydrostatic pressure. The black arrow corresponds to 2.5 GPa where the 
Bi-S1 bond length become isotropic, indicating a phase transition from a distorted 
structure to high-symmetry T0 structure. Since the difference between a distorted T1-T3 
and T0 structure is just a stretched Bi-S1 plane (but no bond breaking), different pressure 
will lead to a structure with either larger or smaller in-plane distortion. If the distortion 
vanishes under pressure, then a phase transition will ensue from T1-T3 to T0. (b) 
Schematic illustration of the relative energy of different polytypes in LaOBiS2-family. 
The dashed horizontal lines denote structures that are dynamic unstable. Dashed box: top 
view of AsS2 layer in LaOAsS2, in which the unit cell is denoted by the solid frame. The 
strong distortion separates the layer into individual zigzag chains.
