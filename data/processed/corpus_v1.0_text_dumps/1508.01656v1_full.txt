Pressure effects on a recently discovered BiS2-based superconductor 
Bi2(O,F)S2 (Tc = 5.1 K) were examined via two different methods; high 
pressure resistivity measurement and high pressure annealing.  The 
effects of these two methods on the superconducting properties of 
Bi2(O,F)S2 were significantly different although in both methods 
hydrostatic pressure is applied to the sample by the cubic-anvil-type 
apparatus.  In high pressure resistivity measurement, Tc linearly 
decreased at the rate of -1.2 K GPa-1.  In contrast, the Tc of 5.1 K is 
maintained after high pressure annealing under 2 GPa and 470°C of 
optimally doped sample despite significant change of lattice parameters. 
In addition, superconductivity was observed in fluorine-free Bi2OS2 
after high pressure annealing. These results suggest that high pressure 
annealing would cause a unique effect on physical properties of layered 
compounds. 
 
1. Introduction 
   Since the discovery of superconductivity in Bi4O4S3
1), various layered superconductors 
with rock-salt type BiS2 layer have been reported.  BiS2-based superconductors have varied 
blocking layers such as fluorite-type RE(O,F) layer (RE = La2), Ce3), Pr4) and Nd5)) and 
(Sr,La)F layer6).  Recently some related compounds with complex stacked structure, such as 
Eu3Bi2S4F4 (Tc = 1.5 K) 7) and LaPbBiS3O (non-superconductor)8), has also been reported. 
Some of the BiS2-based superconductors show increase of Tc by applying high pressures 
(HP).  In HP resistivity measurement, La(O,F)BiS2 shows sudden increase of Tc at ~1 GPa 
from ~3 K to ~10 K9) and then Tc slowly decreases at the slope of -0.28 K GPa-1 10).  
Structural analysis at room temperature suggests that structural phase transition from 


2 
 
tetragonal (P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P21/m) structure would be responsible for the increase of 
Tc
10).  Other RE(O,F)BiS2 (RE = Ce ~ Nd)9,11), (Sr,La)FBiS2
12), and Eu3Bi2S4F4
13) also shows 
the jump-up of Tc to 7~10 K at a certain pressure of 1~2 GPa . 
Similar increase of Tc is also obtained by “HP annealing”. In HP annealing, the 
as-synthesized samples undergo heat treatment in HP synthesis apparatus and physical 
properties are measured under ambient pressure.  In La(O,F)BiS2, Tc increase from ~3 K to 
10.6 K after HP annealing at 2 GPa, 600°C2)
.  Ce(O,F)BiS2
14) and Pr(O,F)BiS2
15) also show 
increase of Tc by HP annealing.  In HP annealing, crystal structure is kept at tetragonal and 
uniaxial contraction of the lattice along c-axis is attributed to the cause for the increase of 
Tc
15,16). 
   Recently, superconductivity in Bi2(O,F)S2 (i.e. Bi(O,F)BiS2), which is isostructural with 
RE(O,F)BiS2, is reported17)18).  Tc varies with changing F-doping level in the underdoped 
region and reaches to 5.1 K in the optimally-doped sample, while it is impossible to obtain 
overdoped sample due to the solubility limit of F- for the O2- site17).  In the present paper, 
pressure effects on Bi2(O,F)S2 were examined by HP resistivity measurement and HP 
annealing.  The difference of these two methods in the variation of Tc in Bi2(O,F)S2 is 
discussed. 
 
2. Experimental 
Undoped Bi2OS2 was synthesized via solid-state reaction at 300°C, ~100 h in an 
evacuated quartz ampule with several intermediate grindings.  Bi2(O,F)S2 was synthesized 
by the topotactic reaction between undoped Bi2OS2 and XeF2 at 400°C, 72 h in an evacuated 
quartz ampule according to the following chemical reaction. 
Bi2OS2 (s) + (x/2) XeF2 (s)  Bi2(O1-xFx)S2 (s) + (x/2) Xe (g) + (x/2) O2 (g). 
Bi2(O,F)S2 samples with different F-content were separately prepared by changing the 
nominal amount of XeF2 between (x/2) = 0.1~0.5.  Note that actual composition of F is 
supposed to be smaller than the nominal x, while investigation of actual F content is difficult 
due to the small difference in X-ray scattering factors between O and F.  Details of synthesis 
procedure are described in ref 17). 
   Resistivity measurements were performed by the four-probe method both in ambient 
pressure and under HP.  Resistivity at ambient pressure is measured by Quantun Design 
Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS).  In HP resistivity measurement, hydrostatic 
pressures up to 11 GPa were applied to the Teflon sample cell together with liquid 
pressure-transmitting medium Daphne oil 7474 in a cubic-anvil-type apparatus19).  
   HP annealing was performed on the as-synthesized Bi2OS2 and Bi2(O,F)S2 at 300~470°C, 
2 GPa for 1 h in a cubic-anvil-type apparatus.  HP synthesis of Bi2OS2 was also performed 
from Bi2O3 (Furuuchi Chemical, 99.9%) and Bi2S3 (ALDRICH, 99%) powders at 300~550°C, 
2~4 GPa.  BN was used for the pressure media.  The constituent phases of the samples were 


3 
 
analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement (RIGAKU Ultima-IV) w 
ith Cu-K radiation generated at 40 kV and 40 mA.  Silicon powder was used as an internal 
standard to determine the lattice parameters.  Magnetization measurements were performed 
by a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design 
MPMS) and some measurements were performed down to 0.47 K using iHelium320). 
 
3. Results 
3.1 High pressure resistivity measurement on Bi2(O,F)S2 
Hydrostatic high pressure resistivity measurement is performed for the optimally-doped 
Bi2(O,F)S2 polycrystalline bulk sample with Tc = 5.1 K.  The temperature dependence of 
resistivity under pressures of 0~11 GPa is shown in Fig. 1.  Tc monotonically decreases by 
application of hydrostatic pressure of 1~2 GPa.  At 2 GPa, Tc
onset was decreased to 2.7 K and 
zero resistivity was not observed above 2.5 K.  The slope for the almost linear decrease of Tc 
with applying pressure is calculated to be -1.2 K GPa-1 as shown in Fig. 2.  The 
superconducting transition remain sharp even under high pressures, with Tc ~0.4 K, 
suggesting that high pressure is homogeneously applied to the bulk sample. 
Under higher pressures than 2 GPa, superconductivity is disappeared.  Instead, two other 
anomalies, marked Ta1 and Ta2 in Fig. 1, are observed.  Origins of these anomalies are 
attributed to the superconductivity of Bi metal under high pressures.  As shown in Fig. 3(a), 
our sample contains small amount of Bi metal as an impurity phase.  The ambient pressure 
phase of Bi metal, trigonal Bi(I), is not a superconductor.  High pressures induce several 
steps of structural transitions to so-called Bi(II), Bi(III) and Bi(V) phases.  Orthorhombic 
Bi(III) and bcc Bi(V) phases exhibit superconductivity and Tcs of Bi(III)21) and Bi(V)22) are 
very close to Ta1 and Ta2, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2.  
The sudden increase of Tc at a certain pressure observed in RE(O,F)BiS2 (RE = 
La~Nd)9,11), (Sr,La)FBiS2
12), and Eu3Bi2S4F4
13) was not observed in Bi2(O,F)S2.  The 
decrease of Tc with applying pressure is rather similar to the case of Bi4O4S3
23) or Bi3O2S3
24).  
We note that crystal structure of Bi4O4S3 and Bi3O2S3 phase is still controversial25), but both 
structure contains fluorite-type BiO layer in the blocking layer, as Bi2(O,F)S2 does.   
 
3.2 High pressure annealing on Bi2(O,F)S2 
   High pressure (HP) annealing was performed for the as-synthesized Bi2(O,F)S2 with 
different F-content.  Here we discuss the effects of HP annealing on two types of samples; 
underdoped sample with Tc = 3.0 K, and optimally-doped sample with Tc = 5.1 K. 
Figure 3(a) shows powder XRD patterns of Bi2(O,F)S2 samples before and after HP 
annealing at 470°C and 2 GPa for 1 h.  After HP annealing, constituent phases were almost 
unchanged and the peaks for Bi2(O,F)S2 were well indexed to the space group P4/nmm as 
well as the as-synthesized samples.  a-axis length and c-axis length slightly increased and 


4 
 
largely decreased, respectively, suggesting uniaxial contraction of the lattice along the c-axis 
as in the case of La(O,F)BiS2
16) and Pr(O,F)BiS2
15).  We note that the full width at half 
maximum (FWHM) of the XRD peaks were broadened after HP annealing, suggesting 
introduction of lattice strain. 
The Zero-Field-Cooled (ZFC) magnetizations of these samples are shown in Fig. 3(b).  
In the underdoped sample with Tc = 3.0 K, Tc increased to 4.5 K after HP annealing.  
Assuming that F-content of the sample is not changed by HP annealing, the uniaxial 
contraction of the lattice discussed above is supposed to be responsible for the increase of Tc. 
In contrast, in the optimally-doped sample with Tc = 5.1 K, Tc almost unchanged even 
after HP annealing despite significant change of lattice parameters.  The ZFC curve of the 
HP annealed sample seems to be somewhat shifted to lower temperatures.  However, the 
onset of diamagnetic transition is kept at 5.1 K and perfect diamagnetism is achieved even at 
slightly higher temperature, indicating sharpening of the superconducting transition by HP 
annealing.  The maintenance of Tc at 5.1 K is rather similar to the case of Nd(O,F)BiS2, 
which also maintains Tc of ~5 K before and after HP annealing26), than the case of 
RE(O,F)BiS2 with RE = La~Pr where Tc is increased by HP annealing2,15,16).  Here it should 
be noted again that Tc
onset of optimally-doped Bi2(O,F)S2 at 2 GPa was 2.7 K in HP resistivity 
measurement, significantly lower than that of the same sample annealed at 2 GPa.  In HP 
annealing, high pressure is applied at high temperatures and physical properties are measured 
at ambient pressure.  The difference of these two methods should not be dismissed. 
 
3.3 Superconductivity of high pressure annealed / synthesized Bi2OS2 
HP annealing is also performed for undoped Bi2OS2 synthesized under ambient pressure.  
As shown in Fig. 4(a), the constituent phases were almost unchanged, and a- and c-axis 
length increased and decreased, respectively, as in the case of F-doped to Bi2OS2. 
As-synthesized Bi2OS2 did not show large diamagnetism due to superconductivity above 
0.47 K.  We note that the magnetization curve for as-synthesized Bi2OS2 shown in Fig. 4(b) 
is obtained at 200 Oe, because at low field, dipole like waveform was not obtained at 0.47 K 
and it was impossible to carry out precise measurement.  This apparently indicates that 
as-synthesized undoped Bi2OS2 is not a superconductor above 0.47 K. 
  In contrast, HP annealed Bi2OS2 showed superconductivity.  The onset of diamagnetic 
transition is ~4 K, a kink in ZFC curve is at 1.8 K and large diamagnetism is observed below 
this temperature.  HP synthesis was also tried to obtain Bi2OS2 from Bi2O3 and Bi2S3 at 
470°C, 2 GPa for 1 h. Bi2OS2 was obtained as the main phase while the amount of impurity 
phases increased compared to HP annealed samples.  Lattice parameters and magnetization 
of the HP synthesized Bi2OS2 were almost equivalent to those of HP annealed sample.  This 
sample showed small diamagnetism from ~4 K and large diamagnetism is achieved below 2.1 
K, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4(b).  These results suggest that the Tc of bulk 


5 
 
superconductivity for the HP annealed / synthesized samples are ~2 K.  The transition at ~4 
K is probably due to a impurity phase with small amount such as Bi3O2S3, although it is not 
seen in the XRD pattern. 
 
 
4. Discussion 
Figure 5(a) shows the Tcs at ambient pressure and at ~2 GPa for various BiS2-based 
superconductors reported to date as a function of a-axis length.  The values of a-axis lengths 
are measured at room temperature and ambient pressure.  Tcs are determined by the onset of 
diamagnetic transition or zero resistivity.  In the doped samples, the Tc and a-axis length 
values are those of the optimally-doped ones.  (Sr,La)FBiS2 has the longest a-axis among 
these compounds.  In RE(O,F)BiS2, a-axis shrinks and Tc increases with increasing atomic 
number of RE from La to Nd.  The a-axis lengths of Bi2(O,F)S2 and Bi4O4S3 / Bi3O2S3, 
whose blocking layers contain fluorite-type BiO layers, are shorter than that of Nd(O,F)BiS2, 
although ionic radius (coordination number 6)27) of Bi is between Nd and Pr.  Tcs of 
BiS2-based superconductors under ambient pressure show a dome-like tendency with the top 
of Tc ~5.5 K at a ~3.98 Å in (Nd0.2Sm0.8)(O0.7F0.3)BiS2
28).  When a-axis in longer than ~4.0 
Å, significant increase of Tc is observed in HP resistivity measurement.  In contrast, 
compounds with shorter a-axis lengths, Bi2(O,F)S2 and Bi4O4S3, show rapid decrease of Tc in 
HP resistivity measurement. 
The relation between lattice parameter and Tc for as-synthesized and HP annealed 
Bi2(O,F)S2 is summarized in Fig. 6.  In the optimally-doped samples with a- and c-axes 
longer than ~3.97 Å and shorter than ~13.73 Å, the value of Tc is maintained at ~5.1 K.  In 
the underdoped samples, a-axis is shorter than ~3.97 Å and c-axis is longer than ~13.73 Å, 
and Tc increases as a- and c-axis expands and shrinks by HP anenaling.  Tcs for undoped 
Bi2OS2 sintered under high pressures are also in this trend.  It should be emphasized that in 
HP annealed / synthesized undoped Bi2OS2, superconductivity is achieved without intentional 
carrier doping.  In Bi2OS2, the Bi-S planes are not very flat, the in-plane S-Bi-S angle being 
159.8°25).  The expansion of a-axis may lead to flatter Bi-S plane.  In LaOBiS2, F-doping 
not only increases the carrier concentration but also flattens the buckling of the Bi–S plane 
and this structural transformation is also related to the appearance of superconductivity29).  
Similar phenomena would happen in the undoped and underdoped Bi2(O,F)S2 by HP 
annealing, which resulted in the increases of Tcs in these samples. 
   The decrease of Tc in HP resistivity measurement might be explained by the tendency 
shown in Fig. 6(a).  In HP resistivity measurement, a-axis might shrink by applying high 
pressures at low temperatures, and superconductivity could be disappeared.  Structural 
analysis on Bi2(O,F)S2 under high pressures at low temperatures would provide fruitful 
information to clear this point.

5. Conclusion 
   High pressure (HP) resistivity measurement and HP annealing were performed for a 
BiS2-based superconductor Bi2(O,F)S2, which caused different variation of Tc.  In HP 
resistivity measurement, Tc linearly decreased at the rate of -1.2 K GPa-1.  In contrast, by HP 
annealing at 2 GPa and 470°C, Tc increased in undoped and underdoped samples, and 
maintained at 5.1 K in optimally-doped sample. 
In HP resistivity measurement high pressure is applied in-situ at low temperatures, while 
HP annealing quenches the high pressure and high temperature phase to ambient pressure.  
Although in both cases hydrostatic high pressure is applied to the sample by a 
cubic-anvil-type apparatus, the difference between the two methods should be considered 
carefully.  HP annealing technique have been mainly developed on BiS2-based 
superconductors, but this method can cause unique effects on physical properties of various 
layered compounds.
