Resistivity, Hall eﬀect and magnetization have been investigated on the new superconductor
Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating behavior has been induced in the normal state when the superconduc-
tivity is suppressed. Hall eﬀect measurements illustrate clearly a multiband feature dominated by
electron charge carriers, which is further supported by the magnetoresistance data. Interestingly, a
kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity at about 4 K at all high magnetic ﬁelds
when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed. This kink can be well traced back to
the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(T ) in the low ﬁeld region, and is explained as the possible evidence of
residual Cooper pairs on the one dimensional chains.

Superconductivity is induced by the quantum conden-
sation of large number of paired electrons.
The origi-
nal proposal about the pairing by the electron-phonon
coupling is gradually replaced by the more exotic pair-
ing mechanism, such as through exchanging the mag-
netic spin ﬂuctuations, and the superconducting tran-
sition temperature can be increased to a higher level.
The superconducting (SC) pairing mechanism of the
cuprates[1] and the iron pnictides[2], although not yet
settled down completely, should have a close relationship
with the electron correlations of the electrons from the
3d orbits.[3–5] In the heavy Fermion systems[6] and or-
ganic materials[7], a similar conclusion may be achieved.
In this regard, it is natural to explore new superconduc-
tors with possible higher transition temperatures in the
compounds with transition metal elements.
The elec-
trons in the p-orbital, especially those from the 5p or
6p orbits, are normally assumed to have weak repulsive
potential U and quite wide band width w, and hence
have very weak correlation eﬀect. It would be surpris-
ing to ﬁnd out superconductivity with exotic feature in
the p-orbital based compounds. Very recently, Mizuguchi
et al.[8] discovered superconductivity with T onset

= 4.5 K in the so-called BiS2 based com-
pound Bi4O4S3. This compound has a layered structure
with the space group of I4/mmm or I −42m.
After
just three days, the same group reported superconduc-
tivity at about 10.6 K in another system LaO1−xFxBiS2
by doping electrons into the material through substi-
tuting oxygen with ﬂuorine.[9] Recalling that the same
doping technique was used by Kamihara et al.[2] in the
discovery of superconductivity in the FeAs-based super-
conductor LaO1−xFxFeAs. Quickly followed is the the-
oretical work based on the ﬁrst principles band struc-
ture calculations,[10] which predicts that the dominating
bands for the electron conduction as well as for the super-
conductivity are derived from the Bi 6px and 6py orbits.
In this Letter, we present the ﬁrst set of data for an in-
tensive study on the transport and magnetic properties
of the new superconductor Bi4O4S3. Our results clearly
illustrate the multi-band, strong ﬂuctuation and some
unexpected anomalous properties of superconductivity,
putting this interesting superconductor as an exotic one.
The polycrystalline samples were synthesized by using
a two-step solid state reaction method. First, the start-
ing materials Bi powder (purity 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and
sulfa powders (purity 99.99%, Alfa Aesar) were mixed in
2:3 ratio, ground and pressed into a pellet shape. Then
it was sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and followed
by annealing at 500◦C for 10 hours. The resultant pellet
was smashed and ground together with the Bi2O3 pow-
der (purity 99.5%, Alfa Aesar) and sulfa powder, in stoi-
chiometry as the formula Bi4O4S3. Again it was pressed
into a pellet and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and
burned at 510◦C for 10 hours. Then it was cooled down
slowly to room temperature. The second step was re-
peated in achieving good homogeneity.
The resultant
sample looks black and very hard. We cut the sample and
obtained a specimen with a rectangular shape (length 4.2
mm, width 2.0 mm and thickness of 0.125 mm). Since it
is very hard, we can polish the sample with very ﬁne sand
paper and obtained shiny and mirror like surface. The
crystallinity of the sample was checked by using the x-ray
diﬀraction (XRD) with the Brook Advanced D8 diﬀrac-
tometer with Cu Kα radiation.
The analysis of XRD
data was done with the softwares Powder-X, Fullprof and
Topas. The XRD pattern looks very similar to that re-
ported by Mizuguchi et al.[8]. The Rietveld ﬁtting was
done with the GSAS program, yielding a 90% volume of
Bi4O4S3 with 10% of impurities which are mainly Bi2S3.
The resistivity, Hall eﬀect were measured with Quantum
Design instrument PPMS-16T and PPMS-9T, and the
magnetization was detected by the Quantum Design in-
strument SQUID-VSM with a resolution of about 5 ×
10−8 emu. The six-lead method was used in the trans-
port measurement on the longitudinal and the transverse
resistivity at the same time. The resistance and Hall ef-
fect was measured by either sweeping magnetic ﬁeld at
a ﬁxed temperature or sweeping temperature at a ﬁxed
ﬁeld, both set of data coincide very well. The tempera-

1 T; and 9, 12, 14 T. It is found that the bulk superconduc-
tivity can be quickly suppressed by the magnetic ﬁeld, while
the onset transition temperature changes slightly, indicating a
strong ﬂuctuation eﬀect. (d) Temperature dependence of the

ture stabilization was better than 0.1% and the resolution
of the voltmeter was better than 10 nV.
In Fig. 1(a) we present the temperature dependence
of resistivity measured at three magnetic ﬁelds: µ0H =
0, 6 and 14 T. In addition to the moderate magnetore-
sistance, one can see that a weak insulating behavior is
induced by the magnetic ﬁeld.
This is of course anti-
intuitive for a normal state with Fermi liquid character-
istic. A simple explanation would be that the insulating
feature is given by an adjacent competing order here,
once the superconductivity is suppressed, the latter is
promoted. However, we should mention that the insu-
lating behavior starts actually at 25 K (at 6 and 14 T)
which is far beyond the superconducting transition tem-
perature here. Another possibility is that the conduction
band has a very shallow band edge, as illustrated by the
band structure calculations.[10] When a magnetic ﬁeld
is applied, the density of states (DOS) of the spin-up
and spin-down electrons will become asymmetric given

by the Zeeman eﬀect. Therefore we have some polarized
electrons which induce the weak insulating behavior. In
Fig. 1(b) we present the magnetization data measured
in the zero-ﬁeld-cooled (ZFC) and the ﬁeld-cooled mode
(FC). The superconducting magnetic transition starts at
about 3.6 K, far below the onset transition temperature
which is about 10 K (determined by the deviating from
the normal state background of resistivity) and 4.6 K (de-
termined in using the crossing point of the normal state
line and the extrapolation of the steep transition line).
Therefore strong superconducting ﬂuctuation is clearly
present in this sample. This is actually expected by the
band structure calculations which predict a low dimen-
sionality of the electronic structure, and can be corrob-
orated by the quickly broadened transition under mag-
netic ﬁelds, as shown in Fig. 1(c). One can see that the
bulk superconductivity can be suppressed above 2 K by a
magnetic ﬁeld as low as 0.9 T. However, even the bulk su-
perconductivity can be easily suppressed, a kink appears
on the ρ vs T curve. If following the onset transition of
the resistivity, as shown in Fig. 1(d), we can clearly see

that the kink can be traced back very well with the upper
critical ﬁeld Hc2(T ) in the low ﬁeld region. Surprisingly,
this kink stays at about 4 K even with a magnetic ﬁeld
of 14 T. We interpret this kink as the residual Cooper
pairs existing in the system even the bulk superconduc-
tivity is completely suppressed. Following the tendency
of this kink, a very high critical ﬁeld can be expected in
the zero temperature limit, which certainly exceeds the
Pauli limit given by µ0Hp = 1.84Tc (T) (where Tc is in
unit of Kelvin).[11]
In order to elucidate the normal state transport prop-
erties, we did the Hall eﬀect measurement.
As shown
in Fig. 2 (a), the transverse resistivity remains negative
at all temperatures, indicating the electron like charge
carriers as the dominating one.
It is remarkable that
the ﬁeld dependence of ρxy exhibits an extremely curved
feature at all temperatures, prohibiting any single band
description of Fermi liquid.
Since the plot ρxy vs.
H
is extremely curved, it is not possible to use the slope
of dρxy/dT to determine the Hall coeﬃcient, we thus
determine the Hall coeﬃcient RH by using the formula
RH = ρxy/H at a ﬁxed magnetic ﬁeld, here 9T. The data
is shown in Fig. 2 (b). A clear temperature dependence
of the Hall coeﬃcient RH can be seen. One can see that
the temperature dependence of the Hall coeﬃcient RH
is non-monotonic. An enhancement of RH is observed
below 25 K, which coincides very well with the starting
point of the insulating behavior as seen from the resis-
tivity data. Taking the value at 2 K, and using a single
band assumption, we get the charge carrier density of
4.5 × 1019/cm3. This indicates that the superconductor,
as the cuprates and the iron pnictides, has a very low
superﬂuid density.
In the study of the Hall eﬀect of clean MgB2 supercon-
ductors, our group has also observed a curved ρxy vs. H
and a strong temperature dependence of RH, this was ex-
plained very well by the multiband scattering eﬀect.[12]
As explained in that paper, a natural consequence of the
multiband eﬀect is that one should see a strong magne-
toresistance eﬀect. It is well known that the magnetore-
sistance is a very powerful tool to investigate the elec-
tronic scattering process and the message of the Fermi
surface.
As mentioned above, in MgB2, a large mag-
netoresistance (MR) was found which is closely related
to the multiband property.[12, 13] For the present new
superconductor, we also measured and found a moder-
ate MR, as shown in Fig. 1(a) and (c).
In Fig. 3 (a)
we present the ﬁeld dependence of the longitudinal resis-
tivity. Clearly a 40% to 50% increase of resistivity can
be observed at a magnetic ﬁeld of 9 T. In Fig. 3(b) we
present the MR ratio, i.e., ∆ρ/ρ0, where ρxx is the resis-
tivity and ρ0 is the resistivity at zero ﬁeld. One can see
that the MR is about 52% at 10 K and 9 T. This MR
ratio is signiﬁcant and diﬃcult to be understood with
a single band picture of the Fermi liquid. Considering
that the sample is a polycrystalline sample, the MR ef-
fect may be weakened by mixing the transport compo-
nents with the magnetic ﬁeld along diﬀerent directions
of the crystallographic axes.
For a single band metal
with a symmetric Fermi surface, the Kohler’s law is nor-
mally obeyed. Kohler’s law[14] shows that the magne-
toresistance ∆ρxx/ρ0 measured at diﬀerent temperatures
should be scalable with the variable H/ρ0. For MgB2,
the Kohler’s law is not obeyed because of the multiband
property.[13] We also do the scaling based on the Kohler’s
law for this sample, the result is shown in Fig. 3 (b).
Clearly, the data measured at diﬀerent temperatures do
not overlap and the Kohler’s law is seriously violated for
this material.
This discrepancy indicates that in this
new superconductor there is clear multiband eﬀect, as ex-
pected by the theoretical calculations.[10] However, the
MR in this sample do show some specialty. For two-band
or multiband materials with weak MR, the MR ratios
could be well described by the expression ∆ρ/ρ0 ∝H2
in the low ﬁeld region. This is because the contribution
of the higher order even terms of µ0H could be omitted
at a low ﬁeld (the odd terms are absent here according
to the Boltzmann equation for electronic transport). But
for the present material, the MR ratio exhibits a roughly
linear feature in the low ﬁeld region, deviating from the
expectation. This eﬀect is also found in NbSe2 which has
a complex Fermi surface structure.[15] In this sense, the

anomalies mentioned above in the present new supercon-
ductor may also be induced by multiband eﬀect together
with complex Fermi surfaces.
Next we have a look at whether there is a sizable
local magnetic moment.
For a system with the mag-
netic ﬂuctuation given by the local moments, the mag-
netization have two major origins:
Pauli susceptibil-
ity and the ionic (orbital and the nuclei) contribution.
Assuming the total magnetic susceptibility is given by
χ(T ) = χ(0)[1 −(T/TE)2] + C/(T + T0). The ﬁrst term
comes from the Pauli susceptibility corrected with a tem-
perature dependence of the DOS at the Fermi energy.
The TE is a parameter proportional to the Fermi energy.
The second term is related to the magnetism arising prob-
ably from the contributions of the local moments.
In
Fig. 4 we show the temperature dependence of the mag-
netic susceptibility measured at a ﬁeld of 3 Tesla. One
can see a plateau of the magnetic susceptibility above 100
K, which is mainly contributed by the conduction elec-
trons (the Pauli susceptibility). In the low temperature
region, one can clearly see a divergence of the suscep-
tibility. By ﬁtting the data to above equation, we get
χ(0) = 0.000736 emu/molOe, TE = 1335 K, C = 0.0034
emuK/molOe and T0 = 3.32 K. Once C is determined,
we can get the magnetic moment given by each Bi atom.
It turns out that µeff/Bi = 0.096µB. This indicates that
the local moment of the Bi atom is very weak although
with a ﬁnite value.
Finally we present a phase diagram based on our trans-
port and magnetization measurement and give discus-
sions on the possible mechanism of superconductivity.

FIG. 5: (color online) Phase diagram derived from the resis-

the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 shown by the red ﬁlled circles, the
bulk superconductivity is established in a very small area cov-
ered by the curve name Hirr(T) (blue down triangles). The
large area between them indicates a strong superconducting
phase ﬂuctuation. The curve marked with Hc2 (cross) marks
the upper critical ﬁeld determined using the usual crossing

mined by 99%ρn is shown by the red ﬁlled circles. The
bulk superconductivity is established in a very small area
covered by the irreversibility line Hirr(T) (blue down tri-
angles). The large area between them indicates a strong
superconducting phase ﬂuctuation. This is actually con-
sistent with the theoretical expectation because the elec-
tronic system has an one dimensional feature. The curve
marked with H2c (cross) gives the upper critical ﬁeld de-
termined using the usual crossing point of the normal
state background and the extrapolated line of the steep
resistive transition part. The most puzzling point is the
kink appearing in the ρ vs. T data at a high magnetic
ﬁeld. The curve marked with Hc(kink) shows the critical
ﬁeld determined from the kinky point of the resistive data
shown in Fig. 1(d), by following the trace of the arrowed
red line there. Since this line traces very well to the onset
transition point marked by Hc2(99%ρn) in the low ﬁeld
region, we naturally attribute it to the existence of resid-
ual Cooper pairs. If this kink can be interpreted as the
onset for the pairing, that would indicate a very strong
pairing strength. In a simple BCS argument, we have
Hc2 = (πΦ0)/2¯hv2
F )∆2
sc, where Φ0 is the ﬂux quanta, vF
is the Fermi velocity. Such a strong pairing needs cer-
tainly a reasonable cause, which exceeds the limit of the
simple phonon mediated picture. Taking account of the


5
weak correlation eﬀect in the Bi 6p electrons, some other
novel mechanism, such as the valence ﬂuctuation of the
Bi2+ and Bi3+, may play an important role in this new
superconductor.
In summary, resistivity, Hall eﬀect and magnetization
have been intensively investigated on the new supercon-
ductor Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating behavior is induced
in the normal state when a high magnetic ﬁeld is ap-
plied. This can be induced either by an adjacent com-
peting order, or the very shallow px and py band and
small Fermi energy. Both the strong non-linear Hall ef-
fect and the magnetoresistance indicate the multiband
feature. A kink appears on the temperature dependence
of resistivity at all high magnetic ﬁelds when the bulk
superconductivity is completely suppressed.
This kink
can be well traced back to the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2(T )
in the low ﬁeld region. We argue that the superconduct-
ing pairing, for some reason, could be very strong and
occur ﬁrst in the one dimensional chains, then the bulk
superconductivity is established through the Josephson
coupling between them.
We appreciate the useful discussions with Qianghua
Wang and Jianxin Li.
