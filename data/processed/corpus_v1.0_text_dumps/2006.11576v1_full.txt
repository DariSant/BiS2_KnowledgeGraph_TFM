Abstract  
Recently, two-fold symmetric in-plane anisotropy of the superconducting properties have been 
observed in a single crystal of BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) layered superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe 
having a tetragonal (four-fold-symmetric) in-plane structure; the phenomena are very similar to 
those observed in nematic superconductors. To explore the origin of the two-fold symmetric 
anisotropy in the BiCh2-based system, we have investigated the electron-doping dependence on 
the anisotropy by examining the in-plane anisotropy of the magnetoresistance in the 
superconducting states for a single crystal of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe under high magnetic fields up to 15 
T. We observed a two-fold symmetry of in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance for 
LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. The results obtained for LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe are quite similar to those observed for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, which has a higher electron doping concentration than LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Our 
present finding suggests that the emergence of the in-plane symmetry breaking in the 
superconducting state is robust to the carrier concentration in the series of LaO1-xFxBiSSe.

1. Introduction 
The BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) superconductor family [1–3], discovered in 2012, has been 
extensively studied because of the crystal structure similar to the cuprate- and the iron-based high-
transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors [4,5]. Particularly, the crystal structure of the 
REOBiCh2 (RE: rear earth) systems resemble to that of the iron pnictide system REOFeAs [5]. 
The typical REOBiS2 system has a layered crystal structure composed of the REO insulating layer 
and the BiCh2 conducting layer, as shown in Fig. 1(a) [2,3]. The F substitution for the O site 
generates electron carriers in the BiCh2 layers, which results in the emergence of 
superconductivity. The highest Tc among the BiCh2-based superconductors is 11 K for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 prepared under high pressure [6,7]. The pairing mechanisms of the 
superconductivity for the BiCh2-based superconductors have not been clarified. Recent theoretical 
calculations and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) have suggested that the 
unconventional pairing mechanisms are essential for the superconductivity of the BiCh2-based 
superconductors [8,9]. Moreover, a study of selenium isotope effect for the BiCh2-based 
superconductor LaO0.6F0.4BiSSe revealed that the isotope effect exponent (Se) on Tc was close to 
zero (-0.04 < Se0.04). This result cannot be explained by the electron-phonon mechanism 
and supports unconventional paring mechanisms [10]. 
Recently, particularly in the layered superconductors, nematicity has been a hot topic 
due to the possible relation to the unconventional superconducting states. Electronical nematicity 
has been observed in various unconventional superconductors, such as the cuprate and the iron-
based superconductors. Those superconductors show the rotational symmetry breaking while the 
structural symmetry has been maintained as above the Tc [11,12]. Also, nematic superconductivity 
has been observed in AxBi2Se3 (A = Cu, Sr, Nb) [13-18]. The CuxBi2Se3 superconductor is known 
as an odd-parity superconductor, which can be categorized as topological superconductivity. In 
the superconducting state of AxBi2Se3, two-fold symmetry of the superconducting gap was 
observed while the crystal structure has a hexagonal superconducting plane with six-fold 
symmetry. The unconventional superconducting states in doped Bi2Se3 are related to the strong 
spin-orbit coupling and multi-orbital characteristics. The BiCh2-based superconductors also 
possess a strong spin-orbit coupling due to Bi-6p electrons and local inversion symmetry breaking 
due to the van der Waals gap of the BiCh2 bilayers [19-22]. In addition, a thin film of a related 
compound LaOSbSe2 was predicted as the Dirac material [23]. On the basis of these similarities 
to the CuxBi2Se3 system, nematic or related exotic phenomena can be expected for the 
superconducting states of the BiCh2-based compounds. Indeed, two-fold symmetric in-plane 
anisotropy was recently observed in the superconducting states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, whose 
conducting plane has a four-fold tetragonal symmetry [24]. This observation suggests that the 
BiCh2 superconductors are promising candidates of nematic superconductor. In this study, we 


3 
 
show the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance for LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe with a smaller electron 
doping concentration than LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. As similar to the previous study, the 
magnetoresistance of the present sample also showed two-fold-symmetric behavior in the 
superconducting state, suggesting the universal behavior of nematic-superconductivity-like 
phenomena is in the LaO1-xFxBiSSe systems. This study shows that the BiCh2-based compound 
family will be a useful platform to study the physics and chemistry of nematic superconductivity 
in layered materials.  
 
2. Experimental details 
LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe single crystals were grown by a high-temperature flux method in an 
evacuated quartz tube. Polycrystalline LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe was prepared using the solid-state-
reaction method using powders of La2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Bi2O3 (99.999%), and BiF3 
(99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%) and Se (99.999%) [25]. A mixture of the starting materials 
was mixed with a nominal ratio of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe, pressed into a pellet and annealed at 700 ºC 
for 20 h in an evacuated quartz tube. The polycrystalline LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe (0.62 g) were mixed 
with CsCl flux (2.2 g), and the mixture was sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The tube was 
heated at 900 ºC for 12 h, slowly cooled to 645 ºC with a rate of 1.0 ºC /h, and furnace-cooled to 
room temperature. After furnace cooling, the quartz tube was opened under air atmosphere, and 
the product was filtered and washed with pure water. The chemical composition of the obtained 
crystal was investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) spectroscopy. The 
average compositional ratio of the constituent elements (except for O and F) was estimated to be 
La : Bi : S : Se = 1 : 0.99 : 0.93 : 1.0, which was normalized by the La value. The analyzed atomic 
ratio is almost consistent with the nominal composition LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Considering the typical 
detection error in the EDX analysis, we regard the composition of the examined crystal as 
LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. 
The single crystals were ground with quartz powders to get homogeneous powders for 
the SXRD experiment [26]. The synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SXRD) was performed at 
the beamline BL02B2 SPring-8 at a wavelength of 0.495274 Å (proposal No. 2018B1246). The 
SXRD experiments were performed with a sample rotator system at room temperature; the 
diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional semiconductor detector 
(multiple MYTHEN system [27]) with a step size of 2 = 0.006º. The crystal structure parameters 
were refined using the Rietveld method with the RIETAN-EP software [28]. The schematic image 
of the crystal structure refined by the Rietveld refinement was depicted using the VESTA software 
[29]. 
The resistive anisotropy was investigated under magnetic fields up to 15 T using a 
superconducting magnet at the Institute for Materials Research (IMR) of Tohoku University To

precisely investigate the anisotropy, a 3He probe equipped with an accurate two-axes rotator 
system was used. The magnetic field perpendicular to the c-axis was applied. The electrodes were 
fabricated using Au wires and Ag pastes.  
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1(b) shows the SXRD pattern for the powdered sample of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. The 
SXRD pattern was refined using the tetragonal (P4/nmm) structural model. The refined lattice 
parameters are a = 4.10849(9) Å and c = 13.6851(4) Å. The lattice parameters a and c are slightly 
smaller than those obtained with a polycrystalline sample with x = 0.1 in Ref. 25, and the lattice 
constant c for the crystal was comparable to that observed for x = 0.3. Since the lattice constant 
sometimes differs between single and polycrystalline samples in BiCh2-based superconductors, 
we use the analysis result on the lattice constant for the confirmation that electron carrier has been 
doped in the crystal. As mentioned later, from the estimation of Tc, we could assume that the 
carrier doping amount is close to the starting nominal value of x = 0.1. In the Rietveld refinement, 
we assumed that the in-plane Ch1 site [see Fig. 1(a)] was fully occupied by Se, and the Ch2 site 
was fully occupied by S, on the basis of the EDX analysis result and previous structural analysis 
[25]. The obtained reliable factor Rwp was Rwp = 11.5%. In fact, the 00l peaks and others related 
to c-axis direction are broadened and have a shoulder, which should be resulting in a slightly high 
Rwp. This may be due to the strain introduced during the sample preparation by grinding with 
quartz powders and the sticky nature of the crystals. However, the higher angle fitting with the 
tetragonal model (see the inset of Fig. 1) is quite nice. In addition, we did not obtain better Rwp 
with monoclinic model. Although the LaO1-xFxBiSSe phase undergoes a structural transition from 
tetragonal to monoclinic (P21/m), our recent study suggested that the transition is suppressed by 
3% substitution of O by F [30]. Therefore, the crystal structure of the present crystal with nominal 
x = 0.1 can be regarded as tetragonal with four-fold symmetry in the conducting plane down to 
low temperature near Tc.  
Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistance for LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe 
single crystal measured with current along the c-axis. The Tconset is 3.4 K, and the Tczero is 2.9 K. 
These Tc values are comparable to those observed for polycrystalline sanples with x = 0.1. Figure 
3(a) shows the magnetic field dependence of resistance where the magnetic field perpendicular to 
the c-axis was applied. The superconducting states are suppressed with increasing magnetic field. 
Figure 3(b) shows the temperature dependence of the in-plane upper critical field Hc2, estimated 
from the midpoint Tc (Tcmid) in the superconducting transition, for LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. From the liner 
extrapolation of the data reaches 20 T at 0 K. The 0Hc2(0) estimated from Werthamer-Helfand-
Hohemberg model [31] was 13.8 T. The high Hc2 with H // ab is consistent with previous reports 
for BiCh2-based superconductors [3,22].

Figure 4(a) shows a schematic image of the terminal configuration for the in-plane 
anisotropy measurement. To investigate the in-plane anisotropy in the superconducting states, the 
crystal was rotated using two rotation angles.  and are defined as shown in Fig 4(b).  is defined 
as the formed angle from the c-axis to ab-plane and  is defined as the formed angle from the a-
axis to the b-axis. The angle dependences of resistance were investigated for the superconducting 
states in between the onset and the zero-resistance states by tuning the temperature and magnetic 
field based on the obtained field-temperature phase diagram [Fig. 3(b)]. 
Figure 4(c) shows the  angle dependence of the electronical resistance at  = 180º, 0H 
= 4 T, and T = 2 K. The Rmin is defined as the minimum electronical resistance, which was at  = 
90º in the angle scan. Figure 4(d) shows the  angle dependence of Rmin where the in-plane 
anisotropy of the magnetoresistance in the superconducting states (or upper critical field) can be 
investigated from the  scan of Rmin. Although the crystal possessed a four-fold symmetry in its 
in-plane structure as discussed above, an oscillation of Rmin with a period of about 180º in Fig. 
4(d). Furthermore, the plotted data was well fitted by the function of Asin(2)+Bsin(4) 
+ C. The estimated amplitude constants A, B, and C were 0.034(2), -0.0076(24), and 0.1198(17). 
Since the constant A related to the two-fold symmetry oscillation is clearly larger than B related 
to the four-fold symmetry, the appearance of the two-fold symmetry in the in-plane anisotropy of 
the upper critical field should be essential.  
As introduced in the introduction, similar two-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of 
magnetoresistance in the superconducting states has been observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. Since the 
present experiments revealed that LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe also exhibits the two-fold symmetry in the 
superconducting states, we conclude that the carrier concentration is not an essential parameter 
for the condition of the appearance of the phenomena in the LaO1-xFxBiSSe system. This fact 
surprised us because the Fermi surface topology is largely different between electron doping 
concentrations of x = 0.1 and x = 0.5 in the BiCh2-based compounds [32]. The phenomena similar 
to nematic superconductivity states in doped Bi2Se3 systems will motivate further experiments in 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe and related systems. Although there are no theoretical studies predicting the 
emergence of nematic superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds, a theoretical study 
predicted the possible topological superconductivity in BiCh2-based systems [33]. Since the 
pairing mechanisms of the BiCh2-based superconductors have not been concluded [32], further 
theoretical and experimental investigations are needed, and the present result on the in-plane 
anisotropy of the superconducting states in LaO1-xFxBiSSe should be one of the key information 
for the goal. 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have investigated the transport properties of a single crystal of BiCh2-based 


6 
 
superconductor LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe under high magnetic fields up to 15 T. From the c-axis electrical 
resistance (measured with a current along the c-axis), the upper critical field was determined. Also, 
the in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistance was investigated using a 3He probe equipped 
with a two-axes rotator system to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance. From 
the in-plane anisotropy measurements, we observed two-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance in 
the superconducting states within the ab plane of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Since the crystal possessed a 
tetragonal square plane with a tetragonal (four-fold) in-plane symmetry, the appearance of two-
fold symmetry indicates the rotational symmetry breaking in the superconducting states. The 
phenomena are very similar to those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe with a higher electron doping 
concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the carrier doping concentration, which affects the 
Fermi surface topology, is not an essential parameter for the emergence of the nematic-
superconductivity-like phenomena in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. We hope that the results shown here are 
useful for further investigation on superconductivity pairing mechanisms of the BiCh2-based 
compounds and related studies on nematic superconductivity in layered systems.
