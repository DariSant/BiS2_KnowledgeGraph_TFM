Abstract 
We have investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of the BiS2-based 
layered superconductor Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2.  
Bulk superconductivity was observed for x ≥ 0.4, and the transition temperature was enhanced with 
increasing Nd concentration. The highest transition temperature was 4.8 K for x = 1.0. With 
increasing Nd concentration, the length of the a axis decreased, while the length of the c axis did not 
show a remarkable change. The chemical pressure along the a axis upon Nd substitution seemed to 
be linked with the inducement of bulk superconductivity. We found that the chemical pressure effect 
did not completely correspond to the external pressure effect.

1. Introduction 
Layered materials have been actively studied in the field of superconductivity because 
superconductors with unconventional paring mechanisms and/or high transition temperature (Tc) had 
been discovered in layered crystal structures. Recently, we have reported superconductivity in 
several layered materials possessing a BiS2-type superconducting layer [1,2]. The crustal structure 
composed of an alternate stacking of the BiS2 superconducting layers and blocking layers is quite 
similar to those of the Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors. So far, three types of BiS2-based 
materials, Bi4O4S3, REOBiS2 family (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) and SrFBiS2, have found to become 
superconducting upon electron doping into the Bi-6p orbitals within the BiS2 layers [1-9]. Electrical 
resistivity measurements under high pressure revealed that the Tc of BiS2-based family was sensitive 
to application of pressure and can be significantly enhanced [10-12] as observed in the Fe-based 
family [13]. 
In the CeOBiS2, bulk superconductivity has not appeared under ambient pressure, but appeared 
under high pressure with Tc of 8 K. While in the NdOBiS2, the bulk superconductivity has appeared 
under ambient pressure with Tc of ~5 K. These facts indicate that the superconducting properties of 
BiS2-based family depend on both the applied pressure and the structure of the blocking layer. In this 
article, we have investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties of 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 synthesized to clarify chemical pressure effect on Tc of the REOBiS2 family. 
 
 
2. Experimental 
The polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 ( x = 0.0 - 1.0) were prepared by a solid-state 
reaction method. Bi grains, Ce2S3 powder, Nd2S3 powder, BiF3 powder, Bi2O3 powder and Bi2S3 
powder were used as the starting materials. The Bi2S3 powder was synthesized by a direct reaction of 
Bi grains and S grains at 500 ºC in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals were purchased from 
Kojundo-Kagaku laboratory. The mixture of the starting materials with compositions of 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.0 - 1.0) was well-mixed, pelletized and sealed into an evacuated quartz 
tube. The Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2  pellets were heated at 700 ºC for 10h. The obtained products were 
ground, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated again with the same heating conditions to 
homogenize the samples. The obtained samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction using 
the2method. Changes in the lattice volume were discussed with the peak shifts. The 
temperature dependence of magnetization was measured by a superconducting quantum interface 
device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field of 5 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and 
field cooling (FC). 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 (a) shows the crystal structure of REOBiS2 (RE = Ce, Nd). The X-ray diffraction 
pattern for the Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples is displayed in Fig. 1(b). Almost all of the obtained 
peaks were explained using the tetragonal P4/nmm space group. The profiles exhibit quite similar 
tendency upon Nd substitution except for the slight differences in peak shifts corresponding to the 
lattice contraction. The estimated peak positions of the (200) and (004) peaks are plotted in Figure 2. 
The shift of the (200) peak to a higher angle corresponds to the shrinkage of the a axis, while that of 
(004) peak corresponds to the shrinkage of the c axis. Therefore, in this system, the a axis decreases 
with increasing Nd concentration, while c axis does not show a remarkable dependence on Nd 
concentration. Figure 3 (a) shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for 
Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2. Figure 3(b) shows the Nd concentration dependence of the transition 
temperature (Tc) for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 estimated from the magnetization measurements. 
Superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.4. The transition temperature (Tc) is defined as a temperature 
at which the magnetic susceptibility begins to decrease. The Tc increases with increasing Nd 
concentration and reach 4.8 K for x = 1.0, NdO0.5F0.5BiS2.

The chemical pressure effect induces the lattice shrinkage along the a axis. Bulk 
superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.4 where the a axis is significantly decreased. The contraction 
of the a axis seems to be linked with the appearance of superconductivity in the Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 
system. However, the obtained Tc is clearly lower than that observed in the external pressure studies 
on Tc of CeO1-xFxBiS2. The pressure dependence of Tc in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows a transition-like 
behavior and exceeds 6 K under high pressure above 2.61 GPa [11]. In fact, the chemical pressure 
effect on Tc in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not completely correspond to the external pressure effect. 
Therefore, further increase of Tc at ambient pressure in the Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 system should 
require optimization of some crystal structure parameters other than the simple contraction of the a 
axis. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
In this study, we have systematically synthesized the Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples, 
and investigated the crystal structure and superconducting properties. On the basis of systematic 
investigation on the lattice contraction and the susceptibility, we found that chemical pressure effect 
induced lattice shrinkage along the a axis. Bulk superconductivity was observed for x ≥ 0.4, and the 
transition temperature was enhanced with increasing Nd concentration. In this system, the chemical 
pressure along the a axis upon Nd substitution seemed to be linked with the inducement of bulk 
superconductivity. However, the chemical pressure effect on Tc in CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not 
completely correspond to the external pressure effect. To clarify the detailed correlation between 
superconductivity and crystal structure, studies using single crystals are required.
