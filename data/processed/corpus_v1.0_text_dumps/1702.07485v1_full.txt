We have investigated the crystal structure and physical properties 
of LaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase 
diagram of the BiCh2-based layered compound family. From 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements with 
anisotropic displacement parameters, we clearly found that the 
in-plane disorder in the BiSSe layer was fully suppressed for all x. 
In LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are 
suddenly induced by electron doping even at x = 0.05 and 0.1 with a 
monoclinic structure. In addition, x (F concentration) dependence of 
the transition temperature (Tc) for x = 0.2–0.5 with a tetragonal 
structure shows an anomalously flat phase diagram. With these 
experimental facts, we have proposed the intrinsic phase diagram of 
the ideal BiCh2-based superconductors with less in-plane disorder. 
 
 
 
Since the discovery of Bi4O4S3 and REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE: rare earth) superconductors, 
BiCh2-based (Ch: chalcogen) superconductors have been drawing much attention as a new 
class of layered superconductors [1-3]. Since the crystal structure composed of alternate 
stacks of the electrically conducting BiCh2 layers and the insulating (blocking) layers 
resembles those of the Cuprate and the FeAs-based high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) 
superconductors [4,5], many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed to 
clarify the superconductivity mechanisms of this system and to increase Tc. However, the 
mechanisms have not been understood completely. Recently, Morice et al. proposed that a 


2 
 
weak-coupling electron-phonon mechanism cannot explain the emerging Tc, as high as 11 K, 
in the BiCh2-based systems, from first principle calculations [6]. Therefore, full 
understandings of the basic characteristics of the superconductivity in the BiCh2-based system 
are crucial. 
The parent phase of the BiCh2-based superconductor is a band insulator [1,7,8]. On the 
basis of the calculated band structure, electrons carriers are doped into the bands mainly 
composed of Bi-6px and Bi-6py components. Electron-doped BiCh2-based compounds are 
expected to become metallic. Indeed, superconductivity is experimentally observed in 
electron-doped compounds [1-3]. However, the real situations are not simple as expected from 
the band structure. Although the superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds is emerged by 
carrier doping, metallic transport is sometimes absent, and weakly localized behavior 
(semiconducting-like behavior) is observed in electrical resistivity measurements; a good 
example would be optimally doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. In semiconducting-like samples of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, bulk superconductivity is not observed, while weak (filamentary) 
superconductivity is observed. To induce bulk superconductivity in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 system, 
external pressure effects [9-16] and/or element substitution at the La site [17-20], which 
optimize the crystal structure, are available. Namely, both electron carrier doping and crystal 
structure optimization are required for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the 
BiCh2-based system. Recently, we proposed that the enhancement of in-plane chemical 
pressure is the factor essential for the BiCh2-based superconductivity [21]. The in-plane 
chemical pressure is related to the orbital overlaps between Bi and Ch and can be tuned by 
element substitutions at the blocking layer or the conducting layer. For example, in 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2, isovalent substitution of La3+ (at the RE site) by smaller Pr3+, Nd3+, or Sm3+ 
induces bulk superconductivity [17-20], and Tc reaches above 5 K in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 or 
Nd1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2 [17,22]. Basically, the RE3+ substitution does not affect the structural 
symmetry but compresses Bi-S planes along the in-plane direction. Compressing in-plane 
Bi-S distance enhances Bi-S orbital overlaps, and bulk superconductivity emerges. Similar 
chemical pressure effect can be produced by Se substitution for the S site, as demonstrated in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-ySey [23,24]. Although Bi-Ch plane expands by the 
substitution of in-plane S2- by larger Se2- [25], the packing density of Bi-Ch plane is enhanced 
due to the almost fixed structure (volume) of the LaO blocking layer [21]. Then, bulk 
superconductivity is induced by in-plane chemical pressure effect in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey and 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-ySey, as well.

Although the in-plane chemical pressure can be a good indicator to qualitatively discuss the 
emergence of bulk superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds, deeper investigation on 
the essential physical parameters, which are directly correlating with the superconductivity, is 
needed to fully understand the mechanisms of the emergence of superconductivity in the 
BiCh2-based superconductors. In this study, we have clarified that the suppression of the 
in-plane local disorder, which is a typical characteristic of BiCh2-based compounds, is the 
most essential for the emergence of superconductivity. The in-plane disorder in the 
BiCh2-based system has been detected using extended X-ray absorption fine structure 
(EXAFS), X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction [21, 26-29]. In addition, we showed that 
the in-plane disorder could be reduced by the chemical pressure effects [27,29]; the details on 
the suppression of in-plane disorder in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey and LaO1-xFxBiSSe will be 
discussed later with Fig. 2. Therefore, we have focused on the LaO1-xFxBiSSe system, in 
which in-plane disorder was expected to be suppressed by the chemical pressure effect 
generated by the Se substitution of the BiCh2 layer, and systematically investigated the crystal 
structure and physical properties of the LaO1-xFxBiSSe system. 
 
Polycrystalline samples of LaO1-xFxBiSSe with x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were 
prepared by a solid state reaction method. Bi2S3 and Bi2Se3 were pre-synthesized by reacting 
Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.999%) grains. Powders of Bi2O3 (99.99%), La2S3 
(99.9%), BiF3 (99.9%), Bi2S3, and Bi2Se3 powders and Bi (99.999%) grains were mixed, 
pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube, and heated at 700 ºC for 20 h. The obtained 
sample was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated with the same heating condition. 
The crystal structure of the samples and impurity phases were determined by powder 
synchrotron X-ray diffraction (XRD) with energy of 25 keV ( = 0.496574 Å) at the beamline 
BL02B2 of SPring-8 under a proposal No. 2016B1078 for x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. 
The synchrotron XRD experiments were performed with a sample rotator system at room 
temperature, and the diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution one-dimensional 
semiconductor detector MYTHEN with a step of 2 = 0.006º. The crystal structure parameters 
were refined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [30]. For the in-plane Bi and Ch1 
site (see Fig. 1(c) for definitions of Ch sites), anisotropic displacement parameters U11 and 
U33 were used in the Rietveld analyses. For x = 0 and 0.1, U22 was fixed as U11. Using the 
refined structure parameter, schematic image of the structure was drawn using VESTA [31]. 
For, x = 0.05, we have checked the phase purity by conventional XRD with a Cu-K 


4 
 
radiation. 
Temperature dependence of electrical resistivity was measured using a four-terminal method. 
For x = 0.05 with a Tc less than 2 K, the resistivity measurements were performed with the 
3He system of Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, Quantum Design) down to T = 
0.5 K. Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured using a 
superconducting quantum interference devise (SQUID) magnetometer with Magnetic 
Property Measurement System (MPMS-3) by the SQUID-VSM mode. Seebeck coefficient at 
room temperature was measured using a ZEM-3 system (Advance RIKO). 
 
Figure 1(a) shows the synchrotron XRD patterns for x = 0–0.5. We observed peak shifts 
according to the increase in F concentration in LaO1-xFxBiSSe. In addition, for x = 0, we 
observed a peak splitting of typical (h00) peaks, which indicates that the structure distorted 
into monoclinic. The lowering symmetry in x = 0 was unexpected, because, in a previous 
study [32], we refined the synchrotron XRD pattern for LaOBiSSe (x = 0) using a tetragonal 
(P4/nmm) structural model. In the present experiment, however, we could detect this small 
peak splitting in x = 0 by using the high-resolution detector. Figure 1(b) shows the zoomed 
profiles at around the (200) peak. For x = 0, the (200) peak of the tetragonal structure split 
into (200) and (020) of the monoclinic structure. For x = 0.1, the corresponding peak is still 
broad, as compared to those of x = 0.2–0.5, indicating that the structure of x = 0.1 is 
monoclinic rather than tetragonal. To refine the crystal structure parameters, Rietveld analyses 
were performed for all the XRD patterns (See Table S1 and S2 and Fig. S1 in Supplemental 
Materials [33].). For x = 0 and 0.1, the XRD patterns were refined using a monoclinic space 
group of (P21/m), which is the same as the high-pressure phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [10] and 
single-crystal LaOBiS2 [34]. The refined lattice constant of  is 90.189(2) for x = 0 and 
90.101(1) deg. for x = 0.1. For x = 0.2–0.5, the splitting of the (200) peak is suppressed, and 
the Rietveld analyses with a tetragonal space group of P4/nmm resulted in good refinements. 
Figure 1(d) and 1(e) show the F concentration dependence lattice constants of a, b, and c. 
According to the phase transition from monoclinic to tetragonal, a and b of x = 0.1 approaches 
each other. In the tetragonal structure, a increases with increasing x. In contrast, c decreases 
with increasing x. These evolutions of lattice constants should relate to the changes in the Bi 
valence state and the inter-layer bonding states. Figure 1(f) shows the F concentration 
dependences of the Bi-Ch distances. Although the in-plane Bi-Ch1 distance and the Bi-Ch2 
distance does not largely change by F substitution, the out-of-plane Bi-Ch1 distance 


5 
 
monotonically decreases with increasing x. In addition, as listed in Table S1, the Se 
occupancy at the in-plane Ch1 site is almost the same for x = 0.1–0.5, indicating that the local 
structure of the in-plane sites does not change. In Ref. 21, we proposed that the in-plane 
chemical pressure was a good indicator of the emergence of bulk superconductivity in 
BiCh2-based compounds and Tc. In addition, the Se substitution for the S site of the BiS2 
conducting layer is one of the most effective method to enhance in-plane chemical pressure, 
as revealed in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-ySey. On the basis of the in-plane 
chemical pressure scenario, we could expect that the BiSSe layer of the LaO1-xFxBiSSe 
system should be suitable for discussing the emergence of superconductivity by carrier 
doping. 
To further clarify the essence of the in-plane chemical pressure effect in the REOBiCh2 
system, we have performed Rietveld refinements for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey [21,23] and 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe using anisotropic displacement parameters of in-plane Bi and Ch1. See 
Supplemental Materials (Table S1) for all displacement parameters of LaO1-xFxBiSSe. Figure 
2(a) shows the Se concentration dependences of U11 for Bi and Ch1 of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey. As 
reported in Ref. 23, the boundary between bulk superconductor phases (Bulk SC in the figure) 
and weak (filamentary) superconductor phases (Weak SC in the figure) is around x = 0.4 in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey. We notice that, for x ≤ 0.4, U11 for Ch1 is apparently larger than that of Bi. 
If the Bi and Ch1 atoms, which forms the Bi-Ch conducting plane, are vibrating with a close 
amplitude, the values of U11 for Bi and Ch1 should be close. However, U11 for Ch1 does not 
correspond to U11 of Bi, indicating that there is a factor other than lattice vibration. The factor, 
which is the cause of large U11 for Ch1, is local in-plane disorder. In the REOBiS2-based (and 
EuFBiS2-based) systems, in-plane disorder has been observed by extended X-ray absorption 
fine structure (EXAFS), X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction [21, 26-29]. The local 
displacements of Ch1 locally lowers the structural symmetry of the Bi-Ch plane from a square 
to a zig-zag chain. The distorted local structure of the Bi-Ch1 bond is the same as that of 
monoclinic phase, observed in the high pressure phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [10] or single 
crystals of LaOBiS2 [34]. Furthermore, we have observed that the in-plane disorder could be 
reduced by the chemical pressure effects [27]. As shown in Fig. 2(a), U11 for Ch1 decreases 
with increasing Se concentration and becomes almost the same values to U11 for Bi in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, which indicates that the in-plane disorder is suppressed by Se substitution. 
Then, bulk superconductivity is induced in this region with less in-plane disorder. This 
behavior is quite similar to those observed in a cousin system Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-ySey [29].

Figure 2(b) shows the F concentration dependences of U11 for Bi and Ch1 of 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe. In contrast to LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, U11 for Ch1 is small and almost 
corresponds to U11 for Bi, indicating that the in-plane disorder does not exist and U11 
parameters reflect the amplitude of lattice vibration only. Therefore, from the viewpoint of 
local disorder, the LaO1-xFxBiSSe system is an ideal system to discuss the intrinsic nature of 
the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2 layers by carrier doping. Indeed, bulk 
superconductor phases suddenly appear at x = 0.1, and all samples with x ≥ 0.1 shows bulk 
superconductivity, as will be shown next. 
Figure 3 shows the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility of LaO1-xFxBiSSe 
after ZFC and FC. Even at x = 0.1, a sharp superconducting transition was observed, which 
indicates the emergence of bulk superconductivity. The irreversible temperature Tirr, which 
was defined as the temperature where the ZFC curve deviated from the FC curve, is Tirr = 3.3 
K for x = 0.1. For x = 0.2–0.5, sharp superconducting transitions were observed, and Tirr was 
3.8, 3.9, 3.9, and 3.9 K for x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, respectively. Interestingly, Tirr does not 
largely change for x = 0.2–0.5, in spite of the crystal structure evolution by the F substitution 
(Fig. 1). 
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for x = 0, 0.05, 0.1, 
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. For x = 0, the temperature dependence of resistivity shows an upturn. 
This behavior is suddenly suppressed with 5% F substitution. Metallic behavior is observed 
for x ≥ 0.05. For typical REO1-xFxBiS2 [2,16-19,35], a metallic behavior is not observed in 
resistivity-temperature (-T) characteristics, and a semiconducting-like behavior is observed, 
in spite of carrier doping by F substitutions. In contrast, for LaO1-xFxBiSSe, a metallic 
behavior is observed in the -T measurements for all electron-doped samples (x = 0.05–0.5). 
These results suggest that the metallic conductivity can be induced by electron doping in 
BiCh2-based compounds with less in-plane disorder, as expected from the band structure 
[7,8]. 
 For all electron doped samples, a sharp superconducting transition was observed. On the 
transition temperature, we estimated Tczero as the temperature where resistivity becomes zero. 
For x = 0.05, a superconducting transition with Tczero = 1.5 K was observed. Although we 
could not measure the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for x = 0.05, the 
sharp superconducting transition in -T implies the emergence of homogeneous 
superconducting states in the x = 0.05 sample. For x = 0.1, Tczero is 3.2 K. For other samples (x 
= 0.2–0.5), Tc is around 3.8 K. According to the band calculations, the Fermi surface 


7 
 
morphology changes by F substitution [7,8]. In addition, it has been experimentally confirmed 
by angle-resolved photoemisison spectroscopy (ARPES) [36-38]. In addition, for same 
systems, the actual carrier concentration determined from ARPES differs from that expected 
from the F concentration. Including this peculiar phenomena, the relationship between carrier 
doping and the superconductivity has not been fully understood in the BiCh2-based 
compounds. Therefore, the fact that Tczero ~ 3.8 K was observed for x = 0.2–0.5 seems quite 
interesting. From the crystal structure analyses of LaO1-xFxBiSSe, we have observed clear 
changes of the lattice constants and the inter-plane distance (Bi-Ch1(out-of-plane)), which 
suggests that the actual F concentration changes between x = 0.2 and 0.5 (nominal). 
To discuss the change in actual carrier concentration by the F substitution, the Seebeck 
coefficient (S) at room temperature (~295 K) and ~560 K were measured. In addition, we 
calculated S from the electronic structure of this system. We calculated the electronic structure 
in LaOBiSSe by first-principles band calculations (WIEN2k package [39]). We then took 
1000 k-points and RKmax = 7, where R is the muffin-tin radius and Kmax is the maximum value 
of the reciprocal lattice vectors, and used the experimentally determined lattice structure in 
Ref. 40. The Seebeck coefficient was calculated using BoltzTraP package [41] with 100000 
k-points. 
Figure 5(a) shows the nominal x (F concentration) dependences of Seebeck coefficient 
measured at T ~ 295 and ~560 K. For all samples, negative S was observed. Figure 5(b) 
shows the electron concentration dependences of calculated S for the LaOBiSSe-based 
structure. Comparing the experimental data and calculated results of S, we found that the large 
increase in S by 10% electron doping seems the same trend. On the experimental results, S 
slightly increases from x = 0.1 to x = 0.5. On the calculated S for T = 300 K, a flat region 
shows up at around x = 0.2–0.3, and the difference in S between x = 0.15 and 0.35 is only S 
= 10 V/K. Then, S begins to increase at x ≥ 0.35. Namely, the trend of the carrier 
concentration dependences of S in the experiments and the calculations does not correspond at 
higher x. On the basis of these results, we consider that, at higher x, the actual concentration is 
smaller than the nominal values, while it actually increases with increasing nominal x. In 
contrast, at x = 0.1–0.2, the actual value would be larger than the nominal value because even 
x = 0.1 gets on the plateau region, which should begin at around x = 0.15, on the basis of the 
calculations. For the high-temperature data, the S (experimental) clearly changes by F 
substitution between x = 0.1–0.4, which indicates that the actual carrier concentration 
evidently changes by the F substitution in this region, which is consistent with the monotonic 


8 
 
shift of lattice constant.  
From the discussion above, we consider that the electron carrier concentration obviously 
changes between x (nominal) = 0–0.5, but the actual electron concentration may be different 
from the nominal values (x). We speculate that the actual electron concentration for the Tc-flat 
region (nominal x =0.2–0.5) is within 0.15–0.35. 
 
Finally, we have established a superconductivity phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiSSe with 
information about the crystal structure and the normal-state transport characteristics. In an 
ideal BiCh2-based compound with less in-plane disorder, metallic transport and 
superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small amount of electron doping. For 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In 
addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram. 
The intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based compounds should be 
useful for understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the system.  
 
In conclusion, we have investigated the crystal structure and the physical properties of 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based 
compounds. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements with anisotropic 
displacement parameters for LaO1-xFxBiSSe and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, we revealed that the 
essence of in-plane chemical pressure effect was the suppression of the local in-plane disorder 
in the BiCh2 layers. The in-plane disorder causes the absence of metallic conductivity and 
bulk superconductivity in typical REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Since the in-plane disorder was fully 
suppressed for all x in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, this system is one of the most ideal system to discuss 
the intrinsic nature of the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds. In 
LaO1-xFxBiSSe, metallic conductivity and superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small 
amount of electron doping. For LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both 
monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc 
exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram.
