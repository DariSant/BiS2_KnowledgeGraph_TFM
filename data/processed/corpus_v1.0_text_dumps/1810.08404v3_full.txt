Abstract: 
Recently, we reported the observation of superconductivity at ~0.5 K in a La2O2M4S6-type 
(M: metal) layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6, which is a layered compound related to the 
BiS2-based superconductor system but possesses a thicker Bi3AgS6-type conducting layer. In this 
study, we have developed the La2O2Bi3AgS6-type materials by element substitutions to increase 
the transition temperature (Tc) and to induce bulk nature of superconductivity. A resistivity 
anomaly observed at 180 K in La2O2Bi3AgS6 was systematically suppressed by Sn substitution for 
the Ag site. By the Sn substitution, Tc increased, and the shielding volume fraction estimated from 
magnetization measurements also increased. The highest Tc (= 2.3 K) and the highest shielding 
volume fraction (~20%) was observed for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6. The superconducting properties 
were further improved by Se substitutions for the S site. By the combinational substitutions of Sn 
and Se, bulk-superconducting phase of La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 with a Tc of 3.0 K (Tconset = 3.6 
K) was obtained.

Introduction 
Layered superconductors have been extensively studied due to observations of 
unconventional superconductivity and high transition temperature (Tc) [1,2]. In addition, the great 
flexibility of constituent elements and layered (stacking) structure, the studies on layered 
superconductor system can be widely developed. The recent discovery of BiS2-based 
superconductors has also created remarkable attention in the superconductivity community: the 
typical materials are Bi4O4S3, REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb), and Sr1-xRExFBiS2 [3-14]. 
For instance, the crystal structure of the typical system LaOBiS2 is composed of alternate stacks 
of a La2O2 blocking layer and two BiS2 layers. Since the parent phase (LaOBiS2) is an insulator 
with a band gap [15], electron doping is needed to induce metallic and superconducting 
characteristics. Furthermore, local in-plane structure should be optimized to induce bulk 
superconductivity in the BiS2 layer [16]. Thus, the Tc of BiS2-based is sensitive to physical pressure 
[4, 17-21] and chemical pressure [22-24] effects and reaches 11 K in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Therefore, 
an increase in the highest record of Tc in the BiS2-based superconductor family can be expected 
by further material development and tuning of structural and electrical properties [14]. 
Very recently, we reported on the superconductivity in oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3AgS6 
with Tc of 0.5 K [25]. The crystal structure of La2O2Bi3AgS6 is similar to the typical BiS2-based 
superconductor LaOBiS2, but the conducting layer thickness is thicker than that of LaOBiS2. The 
crystal structure of the system can be described as La2O2M4S6, in which the M site can be Pb, Bi, 
and Ag [26-28]. There are two different metal sites [M1 and M2 displayed in Fig. 1(c)] in the 
M4S6-type conducting layer. For the outer layers with the M1 site, Bi selectively occupies, and the 
layers can be regarded as the BiS2-type layers. For the inner layer with the M2 site, NaCl-type 
(Bi,Ag)S2 layers are inserted in between the BiS2-type layers.  
Interestingly, an anomalous transport property was observed in the temperature 
dependence of resistivity in La2O2Bi3AgS6 [25], which is similar to the charge-density-wave 
(CDW) transition in EuFBiS2 [29]. In this study, we have investigated the Sn substitution effect 
for the Ag site in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 and found that the resistivity anomaly was suppressed by Sn 
substitutions. Tc reached 2.3 K for x = 0.4 (La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6). Furthermore, by Se substitutions 
for the S site in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3, the Tc further increased to 3.5 K, and bulk nature of 
superconductivity was confirmed from magnetic shielding volume fraction.

Results 
Sn substitution effect on structural and physical properties in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 
Figure 1a displays the room temperature XRD pattern for La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 (x = 0–0.5). 
All the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 samples are crystallized in the tetragonal structure with the space group 
of P4/nmm. An impurity phase of La2Sn2O7 was observed for x = 0.2–0.5. Fig. 1b shows the shift 
in the 103 peak position, which shifts towards the low angle side for x = 0.1. As the Sn 
concentration increases from x = 0.2 to 0.5, the 103 peak shifts towards the higher angle side. The 
schematic image of the crystal structure of La2O2M4S6 is shown in Fig. 1c. For the La2O2Bi3Ag1-
xSnxS6 phase, Bi selectively occupies the M1 site, and Sn is expected to substituted for Ag at the 
M2 site, which was qualitatively confirmed by Rietveld refinements. The evolutions of the lattice 
parameters by the Sn substitution are shown in Figs.1d and 1e. The lattice parameters are a = 
4.061(1) Å and c = 19.445(1) Å for x = 0 and a = 4.0648(1) Å and c = 19.48(1) Å for x = 0.1. The 
lattice parameter c tends to decrease by Sn substitution for x = 0–0.2, and then, it continuously 
increases with increasing x for x = 0.2-0.5. The lattice parameter a increases for the x = 0.1, but it 
tends to decrease with increasing x for higher x, but the change is small. On the basis of the lattice 
parameter evolutions, the Sn substitution does not largely affect the lattice volume, which may be 
due to smaller ionic radius of Sn2+ (93 pm) than that of Ag+ (113 pm). Since the structure (bonding) 
in the LaO layer is not flexible as compared to the conducting layer, the unit cell volume is mainly 
affected by the blocking layer in the BiS2-based systems. The actual ratio of the metals in the 
conducting layer (Bi, Ag, and Sn) in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 (x = 0–0.5) samples were examined 
by EDX. The nominal and analyzed values of the x are plotted in the Fig. 1f. Although there is 
slight deviation from the nominal values, the analyzed values of xEDX linearly increases with 
increasing nominal x. We found that Bi is slightly excess for x = 0.1–0.3. Therefore, y parameter 
with a formula of La2O2Bi3+y(Ag1-xSnx)1-yS6 was introduced to analyze the Bi concentration. The 
analyzed values of yEDX are plotted in Fig. 1g. yEDX is higher for x = 0.1–0.3 but almost zero for x 
= 0, 0.4, and 0.5. Therefore, we consider that the Bi excess can be ignored in the discussion on the 
Sn substitution (and Se substitution) effect, and we use the formula La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 in this 
paper 
Figures 2a-c show the temperature dependences of magnetic susceptibility (4χ-T) under 
an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe for La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 (x = 0.3–0.5). The diamagnetic signals 
in the 4πχ curve were observed below 2.2, 2.8, and 2.6 K for x = 0.3–0.5 respectively. A large 


4 
 
diamagnetic signal was observed below 2.8 K in the ZFC curve for x = 0.4. The shielding value 
fractions estimated from 4πχ (ZFC) at 1.9 K is nearly 20% [See Fig. 2(d).] while it is still not 
saturated. From the susceptibility results, we consider that Sn substitution is effective to improve 
the superconducting properties of La2O2Bi3AgS6 but not sufficient to induce bulk 
superconductivity. 
Figure 3 shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity from 300 to 0.1 K for 
La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 (x = 0–0.5).  The electrical resistivity at 300 K decreases with increasing Sn 
concentration up to x = 0.3 and increases again for x = 0.4 and 0.5. The normal-state resistivity of 
the Sn-doped samples changes remarkably. For example, the pure sample (x = 0) shows a linear 
decrease in resistivity on cooling below the anomaly temperature T* = 180 K. A similar behavior 
was observed up to x = 0.2. The resistivity anomaly at T* appears for x ≤ 0.2, and the T* shifts 
towards the lower temperature side with increasing x. In contrast, the normal-state ρ(T) for x = 
0.3–0.5 shows an upturn below ~50 K. The anomaly disappears for x ≥ 0.3. Figure 3g shows the 
zoomed view of the Figs. 3a-3f near the superconducting transition. The Tc clearly increases with 
increasing Sn concentration in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. The highest Tc was achieved for x = 0.4, and 
Tc decreases for a higher substitution with x = 0.5. 
The room-temperature Seebeck coefficient (S) for La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 (x = 0–0.5) are 
shown in Fig. 4. The Seebeck coefficient is a good scale for the carrier concentration in BiS2-based 
compounds [30]. We observed a slight change in S by Sn substitution. The S in x = 0.2–0.4 are 
almost the same, but that for x = 0 and 0.5 are slightly large. This suggests that the carrier 
concentrations for x = 0.2–0.4 are higher than those for x = 0 and 0.5. This seems to be related to 
the evolution of Tc. However, the large change in Tc from 0.6 to 2.3 K between x = 0.1 and 0.4 
cannot be simply understood by the carrier concentration only. 
Figure 5 shows the superconductivity phase diagram of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6, which shows 
the interplay between the resistivity anomaly temperature (T*) and the superconducting transition 
temperature (Tc zero). The T* is suppressed by the Sn substitution, and it disappears at x = 0.3. The 
Tc gradually increases with increasing x in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. The highest Tc zero = 2.3 K is 
achieved for x = 0.4. A lower Tc zero =1.9 K is observed for the highest (solubility-limit) Sn 
concentration of x = 0.5.

Superconducting properties of Se-doped La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 
As shown above, the Sn substitution improved the superconducting properties in 
La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6, and the highest Tc and shielding volume fraction were obtained for x = 0.4. 
In the BiS2-based compounds, partial Se substitutions for the S site of superconducting BiS2 layers 
have significantly improved the superconducting properties and the bulk characteristics of 
superconductivity. Therefore, we tried to substitute the S site of the x = 0.4 sample. The 5%-Se 
sample La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 was successfully synthesized, but samples with higher Se 
concentration contained selenide impurity phases. The solubility limit of Se for the S site is around 
5%. The composition estimated from the EDX analyses for Bi, Ag, Sn, S, Se elements was 
La2O2Bi3.09Ag0.65Sn0.26S5.73Se0.27. Since the obtained composition is close to the nominal formula, 
we call the sample with the nominal value below. 
Figure 6 shows the XRD pattern and the Rietveld refinement result for 
La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. Although two peaks related to the La2Sn2O7 impurity phase were 
observed, other peaks could be refined using the tetragonal (P4/nmm) model with a reliability 
factor Rwp of 13.4%. In the refinement, Se was assumed to be substituted for the S1 site. The lattice 
parameters were a = 4.0759(2) Å and 19.4824(11) Å, which are clearly larger than those of 
La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 due to the presence of Se. 
Figure 7 displays the superconducting properties of La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. As shown 
in Fig. 7a, a large shielding volume fraction close to 100% was observed. From the resistivity 
measurements (Fig. 7b), zero resistivity was observed at 3.0 K, and the onset temperature (Tconset) 
was 3.5 K; we estimated the temperature where the resistivity becomes almost 90% of normal-
state resistivity. Although superconductivity was observed, the ρ(T) curve still shows a 
semiconducting-like localization at low temperatures. We have measured ρ(T) under magnetic 
fields up to 9 T. The obtained Tconset and Tczero were plotted in Fig. 7d to evaluate the upper critical 
field Hc2 and the irreversible field Hirr. The Hc2(0) was estimated as 2.15 T using the WHH model 
(Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model) [31]. In addition, from rough estimation with a linear 
fitting of Hirr,  Hirr(0) was estimated as 1.0 T.

Discussion 
Suppression of resistivity anomaly by the Sn substitution 
Here, we discuss the possible origin of the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. As revealed 
in the crystal structure part, the lattice parameters were not largely affected by the Sn substitution. 
Therefore, in-plane chemical pressure amplitude in the Bi-S superconducting plane, which has 
been revealed as the essential parameter for the emergence of superconductivity in BiS2-based 
compounds [24], should not be significantly changed. Therefore, we consider that the in-plane 


12 
 
chemical pressure effect is not the origin for the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. On carrier 
concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases by Sn substitution 
for x = 0.1–0.4, which can be corresponding to the slight increase in electron carriers by Sn 
substitution. However, the large increase in Tc for x = 0.4 may not be understood from the increase 
in carrier concentration only because the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 
0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be quite small. On the basis of these facts, we briefly 
mention about the possible relation to the CDW ordering and the possible scenario of the 
suppression of CDW by Sn substitution in this system. In the -T plots, an anomaly was observed 
in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system. A similar feature in the normal-state resistivity has been 
observed in the EuFBiS2 superconductor (Tc = 0.3 K). The origin of the hump was proposed as a 
CDW transition [29]. We assume that the suppression of the CDW ordering is the origin for the 
increased Tc in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. In addition, the anomaly temperature T* was shifted to a lower 
temperature by Sn substitution, and the anomaly disappeared at x = 0.3. At around x = 0.3 and 0.4, 
Tc is the maximum. These facts imply that Tc increased by the suppression of T*. Although we 
have no evidence for the CDW states in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system and the suppression 
mechanism by the Sn substitution, introduction of randomness at the M2 site may be effective to 
suppress the charge ordering states. 
 
Bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 
As shown in the Result part, a partial Se substitution for S induced bulk superconductivity in 
La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. Although the solubility limit is very low (5%), the lattice parameters 
clearly changed by the partial Se substitution, and the superconducting properties were 
significantly improved. Although we refined three models with different Se site (assuming the 
substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites), we could not find the site selectivity of doped Se. However, 
we expect that the doped Se occupies the Ch1 site in the inset of Fig. 6. In previous reports on the 
Se substitution in BiS2-based compounds, the site selectivity of Se at the in-plane site was observed 
[24,32,33]. According to the relationship between in-plane disorder at the chalcogen site and 
superconductivity in BiS2-based systems [16,24], we assume that Se substitution reduced the in-
plane disorder at the S1 site and induced bulk superconductivity. Furthermore, the room-
temperature Seebeck coefficient for the La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 sample was similar to those 


13 
 
shown in Fig. 4 (S = -25 V/K). This also suggests that the bulk nature of superconductivity was 
induced by local structural optimization but not due to changes in carrier concentration. 
Since we have reported the emergence of bulk superconductivity in La2O2M4S6-type layered 
oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3, we can expect material development in related four-
layer-type oxychalcogenide superconductors. Recently, a new superconductor Bi3O2S2Cl with the 
one-layer-type superconducting layer was discovered by Ruan et al. [34]. In Fig. 8, schematic 
images of typical one-layer-type (Fig. 8a), two-layer-type (Fig. 8b), and four-layer-type (Fig. 8c) 
are displayed for comparison. All the materials have the similar RE2O2 or Bi2O2 blocking layer. 
By changing the constituent elements in the superconducting layers, the thickness can be changed 
in this superconductor family. On the basis of these facts, we expect further development of 
materials with these crystal structures or novel materials with a superconducting layer with a 
different thickness (number of the superconducting layers in a unit cell).

Methods 
The polycrystalline samples of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 
were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The polycrystalline samples of Se-substituted 
La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez with z = 0.3 and 0.6 were also prepared by a solid-state reaction method. 
Powders (or grains) of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Sn (99.99%), and AgO (99.9%) and grains 
of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6-
zSez were mixed in a pestle and mortar, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated 
in an electric furnace. The heat treatment condition was 725 °C for 15 h for both samples. However, 
for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez, heating the sample to 725 °C in 1 h was needed to suppress the 
generation of impurity phases. The obtained samples were reground for homogeneity, pelletized, 
and heated in the same procedure. The phase purity of the prepared samples and the optimal 
annealing conditions were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation. The 
lattice parameters were determined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [35]. Schematic 
image of the crystal structure was drawn using VESTA [36]. The actual composition was analyzed 
by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on scanning electron microscope TM3030 
(Hitachi). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a superconducting 
quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-3, Quantum Design). The 
susceptibility data were taken after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The 
temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] was measured by four-terminal method on 
the Physical Property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity 
measurement down to 0.4 K was measured using a 3He probe platform of PPMS. The ADR system 
on PPMS was used for resistivity measurements down to 0.1 K. For clarity, we labeled the 
examined samples with the nominal compositions. The Seebeck coefficient was measured by a 
four-probe method on ZEM-3 (Advance RIKO) at 300 K.
