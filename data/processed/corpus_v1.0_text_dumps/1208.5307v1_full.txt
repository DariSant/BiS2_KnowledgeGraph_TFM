Abstract 
We report X-ray diffraction, magnetization and transport measurements for polycrystalline 
samples of the new layered superconductor Bi4-xAgxO4S3 (0≤x≤0.2). The superconducting 
transition temperature (TC) decreases gradually and finally suppressed for x>0.10. Accordingly, the 
resistivity changes from a metallic behavior for x<0.1 to a semiconductor-like behavior for x>0.1. 
The analysis of Seebeck coefficient shows there are two types of electron-like carriers dominate at 
different temperature regions, indicative of a multiband effect responsible for the transport 
properties. The suppression of superconductivity and the increased resistivity can be attributed to a 
shift of the Fermi level to the lower-energy side upon doping, which reduces the density of states 
at EF. Further, our result indicates the superconductivity in the parent Bi4O4S3 is intrinsic and the 
dopant Ag prefers to enter the BiS2 layers, which may essentially modify the electronic structure.

I. INTRODUCTION 
   To study the layered materials is one of the strategies for exploring new superconductors. The 
discoveries of superconductivity with high superconducting transition temperature (TC) in cuprates 
and oxypnictides have given us good examples.1,2 In those compounds, the CuO2 layer or the 
Fe2An2 (An=P, As, Se, Te) layer plays a central role in determining the superconductivity. Very 
recently, Mizuguchi et al., reported the superconductivity in layered Bismuth oxy-sulfide Bi4O4S3 
with TC ~ 4.5 K.3 Structurally, Bi4O4S3 is composed of a stacking of Bi4O4(SO4) spacer layers and 
two BiS2 layers.3 Band structure calculation indicates the Fermi level lies within the bands mainly 
originating from the Bi 6p orbitals within the BiS2 layer. So the BiS2 layer was believed to be a 
basic unit as the CuO2 layer in cuprates or the Fe2An2 layer in oxypnictides.3 Since the discovery 
of superconductivity, Bi4O4S3 has attracted increasing attention because it could stimulate 
extensive investigations on the BiS2-based layered compounds for exploring new high-TC 
superconductors.4-9 The Hall coefficient measurements indicate an exotic multi-band behavior and 
the charge carriers are mainly electron-type,4 which is consistent with our Seebeck coefficient 
measurement.5 Our magnetization measurement implies that Bi4O4S3 is a typical type-II 
superconductor.5 Although the characterizations based on the polycrystalline samples with 
impurities, such as Bi and Bi2O3, indicated a bulk superconducting behavior,6-7 it is questionable 
whether the superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 is intrinsic because the almost pure sample synthesized 
by high pressure doesn’t exhibit superconductivity down to 2K.8 Further, chemical doping that 
usually serves as a powerful way to study the underlying physics of superconductivity, however, 
has not been reported up to date. Here we report our systematical structural, magnetic, electrical 
and thermal transport measurements for Ag doped Bi4-xAgxO4S3 (0≤x≤0.2). The lattice shrinks 
gradually with Ag doping. The TC is reduced and finally suppressed for x>0.1. Accompanying the 
suppression of superconductivity, the resistivity is increased remarkably and behaves as a 
semiconductor for x>0.1, attributable to a shift of the Fermi energy (EF) demonstrated by the 
analysis of Seebeck coefficient. For all samples, the Seebeck coefficient is linearly temperature 
dependent at both low- and high- temperature regions with different slopes, indicating a multiband 
behavior. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 is intrinsic and 
the dopant Ag enters the BiS2 layer rather than the impurity Bi phase. 
II. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS 
   The Ag, Bi, S and Bi2O3 powders with high purity in stoichiometric ratio were fully mixed and 
ground, and then pressed into pellets.5 The pellets were sealed in an evacuated silica tube. The 
tube was heated at 450°C for 10 hours, and then at 510 °C for another 10 hours. The obtained 
pellets were ground again and the above treatment was repeated. The room-temperature crystal 
structure and lattice constants were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips 
X’pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation. The electronic and thermal transport measurements were 
performed in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS), and the 
magnetization measurement was performed on a superconducting quantum interference device 


(SQUID) system. 
III. RESULT AND DISCUSSION 
In Fig. 1(a), the XRD patterns are shown for the polycrystalline Bi4-xAgxO4S3 (0≤x≤0.2) 
samples. The Bragg diffractions can be indexed using the tetragonal structure with the space group 
of I4/mmm.3 The diffractions from the impurity Bi were also observed and one of them was 
marked by the asterisk. The diffractions from the Bi4-xAgxO4S3 show a dependence on the Ag 
concentration x, while those from Bi don’t. For instance, the (110) peak of Bi4-xAgxO4S3 shifts 
clearly towards the higher angles as x increases, as seen in Fig. 1(b). As shown in Fig. 1(c), 
however, the position and intensity of the Bi peak are unchangeable with x. This indicates that the 
dopant Ag indeed enters the Bi4O4S3 lattice. The lattice parameters for Bi4-xAgxO4S3 are obtained 
by a standard Rietveld refinement for the powder XRD patterns using the Rietica software.10 As a 
result, both the lattice constant a (=b) and c decrease with increasing Ag content, as plotted in Fig. 
2. 
The temperature dependence of the resistivity ρ(T) for Bi4-xAgxO4S3 was measured by a 
standard four-probe method under a zero magnetic field. As displayed in Fig. 3(a), the metallic 
ρ(T) shape at x=0 changes gradually to a semiconducting one when x > 0.10, accompanying a 
increase of the entire resistivity. Meanwhile, the superconducting transition temperature is reduced 
with increasing x and non superconductivity can be found down to 2K for x>0.1 (Fig. 3(b)). The 
magnetic susceptibility 4πχ(T) is displayed in Fig. 4. In good agreement with the resistivity result, 
the superconducting transition temperature decreases as x increases. Simultaneously, the shielding 
volume fraction, determined as the value of −4πχ at 2 K, reduces from -0.45 emu/(cm3 Oe) for x = 
0 to -3×10-4 emu/(cm3 Oe) for x = 0.7, above which the superconductivity, even if exists, lost its 
bulk characteristics. The superconducting transition temperatures defined by different ways will 
be discussed in the following text. 
The Seebeck coefficient S(T) is plotted in Fig. 5(a) for selected samples. The S(T) is negative 
in the entire temperature range up to 320K, indicating the major carriers are electron-like for all 
samples. As shown in the inset of Fig. 5(a), the Seebeck coefficient at 320K, S320K, increases as x 
increases and a sharp enhancement happens at ~ x=0.10, consistent with the increasing resisitivity 
and the appearance of the semiconductor-like behavior for x>0.1 (Fig. 3). Generally, the S(T) 
consists of three different parts, the diffusion term, the spin-dependent scattering term and the 
phonon-drag term due to electron-phonon interaction.11 The spin-dependent contribution is 
probably very weak since there are no magnetic elements in Bi4-xAgxO4S3. The phonon-drag effect 
gives ~ T3 dependence for T«ΘD, and ~1/T for T ≥ ΘD (where ΘD is the Debye temperature), and 
thus a phonon-drag peak in S(T) at ~ ΘD/5.11 The ΘD is 192K for the parent sample derived from 
heat capacity measurement.6 However, the expected peak structure at ~ ΘD/5 = 38K is absent and 
the high-temperature S(T) doesn’t obey the ~1/T expression, indicating the phonon contribution is 
considerably weak in the current samples. Usually, the diffusion term gives rise to a linearly 
temperature dependent S(T) at low temperatures,11 which is actually observed and shown in Fig. 


5(b) (for clarity, only the data for x=0 and 0.2 are shown). Interestingly, at higher temperatures the 
S(T) exhibits another linear temperature dependence with a different slope for all samples 
investigated. For instance, the cases of x=0 and 0.2 were shown in the same figure. The 
high-temperature linear behavior of S(T) may indicate a different type of dominant charge 
diffusion contributing to the high-temperature S(T). The extrapolations of the linear S(T) portions 
at both low and high temperatures cross at some temperatures, marked as T*. The T* is found to 
be almost constant for x<0.10 within the error bars, but reduces rapidly above x=0.10, as shown in 
the inset of Fig. 5(b). Therefore, it indicates there exist two types of predominant electron-like 
charge carriers, one is active at low temperatures, the other at high temperatures.12 As x increases, 
the high-temperature charge carriers get more and more dominant, while the low-temperature one 
becomes weaker, shifting the T* to the lower temperatures. This behavior is possibly related with 
the px and py orbitals consisting the band structure near the EF.3 This result agrees in principle with 
the multiband feature of the Hall coefficient RH(T) data.4  
We are now focusing on the low-temperature linearly temperature dependent S(T) since the 
superconductivity occurs at the low temperatures. Given a single band mode with an 
energy-independent relaxation time, the slope dS/dT can be written as

where kB is the Boltzman constant, EF the Fermi energy corresponds to band maximum or 
minimum. The EF can be estimated roughly using the slope of the low-temperature linear S(T), 
dS/dT. So, a linear fitting was applied to all data available below 50K. The value of dS/dT is found 
to increase rapidly with increasing x when x < 0.05, and then saturates for x ≥ 1.0 (see Fig. 6). It 
follows the evolution of the superconducting transition temperatures TC
onset, defined as the onset of 
the dropping of the resistivity, and TC
0, where the magnetic susceptibility -4πχ(T) drops, as shown 
in the same figure. Assuming a rigid band, the decreasing dS/dT indicates a shift of the EF to lower 
energy side. According to the theoretical calculation, for x = 0 the EF is just at the position of a 
sharp peak in the density of state (DOS) originating mainly from the Bi-6p orbital within the BiS2 
layer.3 Therefore, the shift of EF will reduce the DOS at EF, N(EF), leading to the reduction of TC. 
The reduced N(EF) can also account for the enhanced resistivity upon Ag doping. This result also 
indicates that the dopant Ag goes mainly to the BiS2 layers, though Bi locates partially on the 
Bi2O2 layers. We note that the lattice effect on the electronic structure may be limited, because the 
observed lattice shrink is only ~ 0.6% along c axis, and ~ 0.2% along a(b) axis, by the doping 
level of x = 0.2. The external pressure that compresses the lattice suppresses the TC, but also 
reduces the normal state resistivity,9 contrary to the enhanced resistivity induced by Ag doping. 
Therefore, the suppression of superconductivity is mainly attributable to the modification of 
electronic structure, for instance, the shift of EF mentioned above, though detailed mechanisms 
need further efforts, particularly from the theoreticians.  
IV. CONCLUSION 
   In summary, polycrystalline Bi4-xAgxO4S3 (0≤x≤0.2) samples were prepared, and physical 
properties investigated. The superconductivity is suppressed by x=0.10, above which the 


resistivity ρ(T) shows a semiconductor-like temperature dependence, in contrast with a metallic 
behavior for lower doping levels. The analysis of Seebeck coefficient indicates a multiband 
behavior and the shift of EF by Ag doping which may explain the suppression of TC. All the results 
demonstrate that the dopant Ag enters the Bi4AgO4S3 lattice and the superconductivity is rather 
intrinsic.
