Abstract 
 
 We have investigated the high-temperature thermoelectric properties of the layered 
compound LaO1-xFxBiS2. The electrical resistivity of LaOBiS2 showed an anomalous 
behavior; a metal-semiconductor transition was observed around 270 K. It was found 
that the value of the electrical resistivity decreased with F substitution. The Seebeck 
coefficient decreased with increasing F concentration. The highest power factor of 1.9 
µW/cmK2 at 480 ºC was obtained for LaOBiS2.

1. Introduction 
 Discovery of novel thermoelectric material is one of the most important issues for 
development of thermoelectric application [1]. Particularly, layered materials have been 
actively studied because their low-dimensional electronic states could result in high 
thermoelectric properties as realized in Bi2Te3, cobalt oxides and CsBi4Te6 [2-4]. 
Recently, layered compounds with BiS2 layers have got much attention because 
two-dimensional superconductivity with transition temperature as high as 10.6 K was 
observed [5-13]. Among the BiS2-based layered compounds, LaOBiS2 is the typical 
system, and it has mostly studied in this one year [6,11]. The schematic image of the 
crystal structure of LaOBiS2 is shown in Fig. 1. It is composed of an alternate stacking 
of the conduction layer (BiS2 layer) and the blocking layer (LaO layer). Recently, we 
found that the electrical resistivity shows an anomalous behavior. Figure 2 shows the 
temperature dependence of resistivity for the polycrystalline sample of LaOBiS2. The 
resistivity decreases on cooling above 270 K while the resistivity shows a 
semiconducting behavior below 270 K. Because of the layered structure and the 
observed anomalous characteristics on the electrical conductivity, we have expected that 
pristine or carrier-doped LaOBiS2 could be a potential candidate for novel 
thermoelectric materials. Here, we show the thermoelectric properties at high 
temperatures for LaO1-xFxBiS2. 
 
 
2. Methods 
 
 Polycrystalline samples of LaO1-xFxBiS2 were prepared by the solid-state reaction 
method using powders of La2S3 (99.9 %), Bi2O3 (99.9 %), BiF3 (99.9 %), Bi2S3 and grains 
of Bi (99.99 %). The Bi2S3 powder was synthesized by reacting Bi (99.99 %) and S 
(99.99 %) grains at 800 ºC in an evacuated quartz tube. Other chemicals were purchased 
from Kojundo-Kagaku Laboratory. The mixture of starting materials with nominal 
compositions of LaO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5) was well mixed, pelletized and 
sealed into an evacuated quartz tube. The LaO1-xFxBiS2 pellets were heated at 800 ºC 
for 15h. The obtained samples were ground, pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quarts 
tube and heated under the same heating conditions to homogenize the samples. 
The prepared samples were characterized by powder x-ray diffraction with CuKα 
radiation using RIGAKU Smart-Lab. The electrical resistivity and the Seebeck 
coefficient were measured by the four-terminal method using ULVAC-RIKO ZEM-3 up 
to 480 ºC in an atmosphere of low-pressure He gas.

3. Results and discussion 
 
Figure 3 shows the powder x-ray diffraction patterns for LaO1-xFxBiS2. Almost all of 
the peaks were indexed using the tetragonal space group of P4/nmm. For x = 0 and 0.05, 
small peaks of the impurity La2O2S were detected as indicated with the “+” symbols in 
Fig. 3. It should be noted that the La2O2S impurity is insulator. Hence, the impurity 
phase does not affect the thermoelectric properties. The lattice constants a and c were 
calculated using the peak positions of the (200) and (004) peaks. The calculated lattice 
constants are displayed in Fig. 4. With increasing F concentration, the length of the c 
axis continuously decreases while the length of the a axis does not show a remarkable 
change. The changes in the lattice constants upon F substitutions are consistent with 
the previous experiments [14,15]. 
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity for 
LaO1-xFxBiS2. With increasing F concentration, the value of resistivity decreases at 
whole temperatures. This fact is consistent with the scenario that the electron carriers 
could be generated in the BiS2 layers upon F substitution. For x = 0, the resistivity 
increases with increasing temperature, which is a metallic behavior. For x = 0.05 – 0.5, 
the temperature dependence of the resistivity does not show small remarkable changes 
with increasing temperature. For all the samples, humps are observed as indicated with 
the triangle symbols in Fig. 5. The hump shifts to a higher temperature with increasing 
F concentration. The hump may indicate the evolution of ordered states something like 
charge-density-wave state which have been theoretically predicted to be possible to 
occur in the BiS2-based family. 
Figure 6 shows the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient for LaO1-xFxBiS2. 
For all the samples, the Seebeck coefficient increases with increasing temperature. The 
value of the Seebeck coefficient decreases with increasing F concentration. The highest 
Seebeck coefficient of 200 µV/K was observed at 480 ºC for x = 0. 
The power factor was calculated using the equation of P = S2/ρ (P: power factor, S: 
Seebeck coefficient, ρ: electrical resistivity). Figure 7 shows the temperature 
dependence of the power factor for LaO1-xFxBiS2. For all samples, the power factor 
increases with increasing temperature. With increasing F concentration, the power 
factor decreases. The highest power factor of 1.9 µW/cmK2 at 480 ºC is obtained for x = 
0.

Although the obtained power factor of LaOBiS2 is much lower than that of 
thermoelectric materials used in a practical application and the partial F substitution is 
not effective for enhancing power factor, we believe that further improvement of the 
power factor in this material is possible. Since this material possesses a layered 
structure, we will be able to tune the physical properties by manipulating the blocking 
layer. A partial or full substitution of the La site by other lanthanide elements, such as 
La1-xLnxOBiS2 (Ln = lanthanide), will generate a chemical pressure effect. Further, a 
partial substitution of La by alkaline earth elements, such as La1-xAxOBiS2 (A = 
alkaline earth metal) will provide hole carriers in the BiS2 layers. Another strategy is a 
replacement of the blocking layer structure. If a blocking layer thicker along the c axis 
could be inserted between conduction layers, two-dimensionality should be enhanced 
and the thermoelectric properties may be enhanced. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
 
 We have synthesized the polycrystalline samples of new layered bismuth-sulfide LaO1-xFxBiS2. To 
investigate the thermoelectric properties, the electrical resistivity and Seebeck coefficient at high 
temperature up to 480 ºC were measured. LaOBiS2 showed a metallic behavior of electrical 
resistivity above 270 K while it showed a semiconducting behavior below 270 K. It was 
found that the value of the electrical resistivity decreased with F substitution. The 
Seebeck coefficient decreased with increasing F concentration. The highest power factor 
of 1.9 µW/cmK2 at 480 ºC was obtained for LaOBiS2. Although the obtained power factor 
was lower than those of the thermoelectric materials on practical use, we will be able to 
improve the thermoelectric properties by manipulating the blocking layer in the BiS2-based 
layered family.
