We report synthesis and superconductivity at 3.7K in PrO0.5F0.5BiS2. The newly 
discovered material belongs to the layered sulfide based REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds having 
ZrCuSiAs type structure. The bulk polycrystalline compound is synthesized by vacuum 
encapsulation technique at 7800C in single step. Detailed structural analysis has shown that 
the as synthesized PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space group with lattice 
parameters a = 4.015(5) Å, c = 13.362(4) Å. Bulk superconductivity is observed in 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 below 4K from magnetic and transport measurements. Electrical transport 
measurements showed superconducting transition temperature (Tc) onset at 3.7K and Tc (ρ=0) 
at 3.1K. Hump at Tc related to superconducting transition is not observed in heat capacity 
measurement and rather a Schottky-type anomaly is observed at below ~6K. The compound 
is slightly semiconducting in normal state. Isothermal magnetization (MH) exhibited typical 
type II behavior with lower critical field (Hc1) of around 8Oe.

Recent 
reports 
on 
superconductivity 
of 
layered 
Bi4O4S3 
[1-5] 
and 
(La/Nd/Ce)O0.5F0.5BiS2 [6-10] had already attracted a lot of attention. These compounds are 
similar in terms of their layered structure and carrier doping mechanism to popular high Tc 
cuprates and Fe-pnictides. Perhaps the role of Cu-O2 planes of cuprates and FeAs of pnictides 
is being played by BiS2 layers in these compounds. For normal pressure synthesized samples 


 
2
the superconducting transition temperature is reported around 4K for Bi4O4S3 [1-5], 2.7K for 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [6,7], 5K for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 [8,9] and at 4K for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 [10]. 
Electronic structure calculations showed that these compounds doping mechanism could be 
the same as for Fe pnictides and their parent un-doped phase is non superconducting [11-13]. 
The BiS2 based layered superconductivity is yet in preliminary stage, still at least one 
systematic on-site substitution study is reported on suppression of superconductivity by Bi 
site Ag doping in Bi4O4S3 [14]. Also reported is a new compound i.e., SrFBiS2, which seems 
to be the ground state of these BiS2 based layered superconductors [15]. In fact appropriate 
doping of mobile carriers in SrFBiS2 could lead to higher Tc. In this short note we report the 
first synthesis and superconductivity of nearly phase pure new member i.e., PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
belonging to the same family of reported (La/Nd/Ce)O0.5F0.5BiS2 [6-10] compounds with 
popular ZrCuSiAs type structure. The as synthesized PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound is nearly 
single phase in nature with small contamination of Bi2S3 and bulk superconducting below 4K 
as established by both electrical transport and magnetization measurements.  
 
 
Polycrystalline PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is synthesized by standard solid state reaction route via 
vacuum encapsulation. High purity Pr, Bi, S, PrF3, and Pr6O11 are weighed in stoichiometric 
ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. The mixed 
powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-4 Torr) in a quartz tube. Sealed 
quartz ampoule is placed in furnace and heat treated at 7800C for 12h with the typical heating 
rate of 2oC/min., and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of six hours to room 
temperature. Thus processed compound was repelletized and sealed in quartz tube and heat 
treated in similar way. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature using 
Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was carried out using the 
FullProf program. Detailed electrical transport, AC/DC magnetization and Heat capacity 
measurements were performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T), 
Quantum Design.  
 
 
The room temperature Rietveld fitted XRD pattern of as synthesized PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 
sample is shown in Fig. 1. Rietveld refinement of XRD pattern is carried out using ZrCuSiAs 
structure and Wyckoff positions. The compound is crystallized in tetragonal P4/nmm space 
group structure. Small amount of Bi2S3 impurity is also observed along with main phase and 
is indicated in Fig. 1. Refined structural parameters (atomic coordinates and site occupancy), 
are given in the Table I. The refined lattice parameters are a = 4.015(5) Å, c = 13.362(4) Å. 
The representative unit cell of the compound in P4/nmm space group crystallization is shown 
in inset of Fig. 1. The layered structure includes rare earth oxide (REO) and BiS2 layers. The 


 
3
doping in REO layer with proper amount of F- at O2- site results in doping of carriers along 
with decrease in c-parameter [6,7]. Various atoms with their respective positions are 
indicated in the inset part of Fig. 1. Bismuth (Bi), Praseodymium (Pr), and Sulfur (S1 and S2) 
atoms occupy the 2c (0.25, 0.25, z) site. On the other hand O/F atoms are at 2a (0.75, 0.25, 0) 
site. 
 
 
Both DC and AC magnetic susceptibility results are shown in Fig. 2. DC 
magnetization is carried out in both ZFC and FC protocols in an applied field of 5Oe. The 
compound exhibits sharp diamagnetic transition at around 3.7K in. The lower inset of figure 
shows the isothermal magnetization (MH) of the compound at 2.1K. PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 clearly 
exhibits the type II behavior with its lower critical field (Hc1) at around 8Oe.  
 
 
Fig. 3 presents the resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) plots for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample 
in applied magnetic field of up to 4kOe in temperature range of 2-4K.  Inset of the same 
shows the resistivity in expanded temperature range of 2-300K. The compound is semi-
metallic from 300K down to 4K. The superconducting onset is observed in resistivity at 3.7K 
and the zero resistivity Tc (ρ = 0) at 3.1K. The semi-metallic normal state conduction is 
observed which is similar to the reported results for (La/Nd/Ce)O0.5F0.5BiS2 [6-10] 
compounds. With applied magnetic field Tc(ρ = 0)  is decreased to lower temperatures. 
Namely the Tc(ρ = 0) of 3.1K in zero applied field decreases to 2.1K under 2.0kOe field.  
 
 
Fig. 4 shows the dρ/dT plots for the studied PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample. Single 
characteristic peak is seen in dρ/dT plots at various fields. Further, the peak temperature 
decreases with increase in applied field, notably in a single step. This is suggestive of single 
superconducting transition and better grains coupling in this system. The broadening of dρ/dT 
peak under applied field suggests that superconducting onset is relatively affected less than 
the Tc(ρ = 0) state. The peak temperature of dρ/dT plots roughly corresponds with the 
superconducting state of the compound. The superconductivity sets in at onset of ρ-T plots 
and is complete at ρ = 0. The peak of dρ/dT plots corresponds to the middle of 
superconductivity onset and exact Tc(ρ = 0) state. In any case, with the application of 
magnetic field both the onset and offset Tc shift towards lower temperature. The upper critical 
field Hc2(T) and irreversibility field Hirr(T) for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be calculated through the 
intersection point between normal state resistivity extrapolation and superconducting 
transition line respectively. The slope dHc2/dT|Tc as estimated from Fig. 4 data is ~ 30kOe/K 
that implies WHH (Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg) Hc2(0) (= - 0.69 Tc dHc2/dT|Tc) value of 
64kOe, which is higher than the one (19kOe) reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 of  [7] and (23kOe) 
for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 [9].

Heat capacity [Cp(T)] of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 is shown in Fig. 5. Hump at Tc related to 
superconducting transition is not observed in heat capacity measurements and rather a 
Schottky-type anomaly is observed at below ~6K. This may be due to some incipient 
magnetic ordering, which may be dominating over superconducting transition of Cp. Similar 
type of Schottky anomaly is also observed for Nd/CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound [9,10]. More 
rigorous experimental and theoretical studies are warranted to invoke these compounds. Also 
a hump like weak jump in Cp measurements is observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [6] and for 
Bi4O4S3 [16] confirming the bulk nature of superconductivity in these BiS2 based 
compounds. The upper inset (a) of Fig. 5 represents Cp/T vs T plot and the lower inset (b) 
shows the Cp/T vs T2 plot. We have carried out the linear fitting of Cp/T vs T2 curve. It is 
estimated that the value of Sommerfeld constant (γ) and the coefficient of the lattice 
contribution (β), as 286.36 mJ/mole-K2 and 0.764 mJ/mole-K4 respectively.  
 
 
In conclusion we have synthesized a near single phase PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, 
which is bulk superconducting at 3.7K. The compound is a type II superconductor with lower 
[Hc1 (2.1K)] of around 8Oe. This is first report on appearance of superconductivity in 
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 in the series of BiS2 based layered REO/FBiS2 compounds.
