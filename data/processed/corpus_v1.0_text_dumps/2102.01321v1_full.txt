Abstract 
Since the discovery of superconductivity in a high-entropy alloy (HEA) Ti-Zr-Nb-Hf-Ta in 2014, the 
community of superconductor science has explored new HEA superconductors to find the merit of the 
HEA states on superconducting properties. Since 2018, we have developed “HEA-type” compounds 
as superconductors or thermoelectric materials. As well known, compounds like intermetallic 
compounds or layered compounds are composed of multi crystallographic sites. In a HEA-type 
compounds, one or more sites are alloyed and total mixing entropy satisfies with the criterion of HEA. 
Herein, we summarize the synthesis methods, the crystal structural variation and superconducting 
properties of the HEA-type compounds, which include NaCl-type metal tellurides, CuAl2-type 
transition metal zirconides, high-Tc cuprates, and BiS2-based layered superconductors. The effects of 
the introduction of a HEA site in various kinds of complicated compounds are discussed from the 
structural-dimensionality viewpoint.

1. Introduction 
1-1. Superconducting materials 
Superconductivity is a quantum phenomenon, which is characterized by zero-resistivity 
states in electrical resistivity and exclusion of magnetic flux from a superconductor [1,2]. 
Superconductivity has provided many exotic research topics not only in the field of science but also 
in application of superconductors. The zero-resistivity states can achieve large-scale electricity 
transport with ultra-low energy loss, very high magnetic fields, which has been used in various devices 
like a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a superconducting Maglev train. Although 
superconductor devises look perfect, the use of superconductors are regulated by temperature in reality 
because superconducting states are observed only at temperatures below a superconducting transition 
temperature (Tc), which is a parameter unique to the superconductor. To use superconducting devices, 
the system must be cooled down to low temperatures lower than the Tc of its superconducting 
components. Therefore, discovery of high-Tc superconductors has been desired. 
In 1986, superconductivity with a high Tc in a Cu oxide (La,Ba)2CuO4 was discovered [3,4]. 
Soon after the discovery, Tc of the Cu-oxide superconductor (cuprate) family reached 90 K for 
REBa2Cu3O7-d (RE: rare earth) [5], which is higher than liquid nitrogen temperature, and finally 
reached 135 K in a Hg-Ba-Ca-Gu-O system [6]. After the discovery of the cuprate family, many 
layered compounds have been searched for high-Tc superconductivity. In 2001, superconductivity in 
MgB2 with a Tc of 39 K was reported [7]. Furthermore, in 2008, FeAs-based layered superconductors 
REFeAsO1-xFx with a Tc exceeding 50 K were discovered [8,9]. Particularly, in the cuprates and FeAs-
based families, unconventional (non-phonon-mediated) mechanisms of superconductivity has been 
proposed to explain their high Tc [10]. 
A surprising discovery of superconductivity at very high Tc of 203 K in H3S was reported in 
2015 [11]. The phenomenon could be achieved at extremely high pressures above 150 GPa, the high 
Tc and possible conventional (phonon-mediated) mechanisms have recently been attracting many 
researchers in the field of condensed matter physics. Furthermore, higher Tcs have been reported in 
related hydrides, LaH10 (Tc >250 K at ~ 200 GPa) [12,13] and a carbonaceous sulfur hydride system 
(Tc = 287.7 K at 267 GPa) [14]. To use high-Tc superconducting states in hydrides, discovery of new 
superconducting hydrides which become superconductive at ambient pressure. The possible strategy 
to realize that is the utilization of chemical pressure effects, which are applied via chemical 
substitutions and sometimes work like external pressure effects. Therefore, further investigations on 
chemical pressure effects in novel superconductors are needed, and high-entropy alloying of 
compounds would be one of the routs to chemically modify the crystal structure of superconductors. 
 
1-2. Superconductivity in high-entropy alloys 
Although layered compounds had been the central topic in searching high-Tc and/or 


3 
 
unconventional superconductors over the last three decades, recent works on new superconductors 
have focused on various kinds of materials, which includes complicated compounds and pure metals 
as well. Among them, high-entropy-alloy (HEA) superconductors have been a developing field of 
study [15].  
HEA is an alloy possessing high configurational mixing entropy (ΔSmix), which is achieved 
by making the alloy with more than five constituent elements with an occupancy ranging 5 to 35 at% 
for each element [16,17]. Typically, ΔSmix of HEA is calculated by ΔSmix = -R Σi ci ln ci, where ci and 
R are the compositional ratio and the gas constant [17], and reaches 1.5R. Due to high ΔSmix, HEAs 
exhibit stability or high performance in high temperature and/or extreme conditions [17]. Therefore, 
HEAs have been extensively studied in the fields of materials science and engineering.  
In 2014, Koželj et al. reported superconductivity with Tc = 7.3 K in a HEA 
Ta0.34Nb0.33Hf0.08Zr0.14Ti0.11 [18]. The HEA superconductor has a bcc structure with a space group of 
Im-3m. In Fig. 1, we compare the crystal structures of (a) a pure Nb metal (Tc = 9.2 K), (b) a NbTi 
alloy (Tc ~ 10 K), which is the mostly-used practical superconductor, and (c) HEA 
Ta0.34Nb0.33Hf0.08Zr0.14Ti0.11. All those materials show superconductivity and the crystal structure type 
is the same. The difference between them is the mixing entropy ΔSmix and Tc. Although the Tc of HEA 
is lower than that of the other two, it was surprising for researchers that such a disordered alloy exhibits 
superconductivity with bulk nature. After the discovery of Ref. 18, various HEA superconductors have 
been developed; material information [18–26] is listed in Table I. 
As 
shown 
in 
Fig. 
2, 
a 
superconducting 
transition 
was 
observed 
in 
Ta0.34Nb0.33Hf0.08Zr0.14Ti0.11 [18]. The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (Fig. 2(a)) 
shows metallic behavior but exhibits a relatively small residual resistivity ratio (RRR) at low 
temperatures. This would be due to the presence of disorder, and a similar trend has been observed in 
various HEA-type superconductors. Bulk superconductivity could be confirmed through specific heat 
measurement as shown in Fig. 2(b). From specific heat data, it has been found that most HEA 
superconductors exhibit conventional (phonon-mediated) pairing states. 
Tc of HEA superconductors show correlation with valence electron count (VEC) [15,21,27]. 
The type-A HEAs with lower VEC exhibit a dependence of Tc on VEC similar to that for crystalline 
metals, alloys, and amorphous materials, and the Tc of HEAs are intermediate between crystalline 
materials and amorphous. In contrast, the Tc of the type-C HEAs with middle VEC shows opposite 
behavior to that for other forms. For the type-B HEAs, the trend of Tc on VEC seems resembling that 
for other forms, but their Tcs are clearly lower than that for crystalline and amorphous materials. As 
mentioned in Ref. 15, there would be a clear effect of crystallinity on Tc at the same VEC range, but 
the origin of the different trends between type-A, type-B, and type-C regimes have not been clarified 
from physical viewpoint. 
Another notable character of HEA is a robustness of superconductivity to extremely high 


4 
 
pressure. As reported in Ref. 20, the Tc of Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti slightly increases by external pressure effect 
and the 10 K-class Tc maintains under extreme pressures like 200 GPa. However, the robustness of 
superconductivity to extremely high pressure was reported for simpler NbTi with a clear increase in 
Tc to 19.1 K at 261 GPa [28]. Therefore, the issue if HEA can improve the stability of superconductor 
under extremely high pressures has not been clarified.

1-3. Concept of HEA-type compounds 
As described in subsection 1-2, superconductivity in HEAs has been discovered and been 
regarded as a new research field of superconductivity. However, the merit of HEA states for 
superconductors has not been fully understood. Therefore, development of new types of HEA 
superconductors is needed. The hint to expand the material variation of HEA superconductors was 
proposed in Ref. 29, in which a HEA superconductor with a CsCl-type structure was reported. Since 
the CsCl structure contains two independent crystallographic sites, we have flexibility of elemental 
solution at the two sites. When calculating total ΔSmix of (ScZrNbTa)0.65(RhPd)0.35 by taking the sum 
of ΔSmixs for site-1 and site-2, it appears to reach very high ΔSmix of 1.79R. A similar site separation 
has been observed in (Nb0.11Re0.56)(HfZrTi)0.33 [30]. Motivated by those studies on HEAs with site 
separation, we have tried to synthesize various “HEA-type compounds”, which contain NaCl-type 
metal chalcogenides [31-33], CuAl2-type tetragonal TrZr2 (Tr: Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Rh, Ir) [34,35], high-Tc 
RE123 cuprates [36], and BiS2-based layered superconductors [37,38]. The concept of HEA-type 
compounds it that we achieve a high ΔSmix by site-selective alloying. As shown in Fig. 4, HEA-type 
compounds have a HEA-type site, in which five or more elements are solving and a normal site, which 
is not in the HEA state. The list of superconducting HEA-type compounds is shown in Table II. By 
studying HEA effects to crystal structure and physical properties in various crystal structures, we could 
identify the merit of HEA states in those compounds. In section 2, we review the material synthesis, 
crystal structure, and physical properties of newly synthesized HEA-type compounds.

2. NaCl-type metal chalcogenides MCh 
2-1. Metal tellurides MTe 
The NaCl-type metal telluride family is one of the hot systems because it includes 
thermoelectric PbTe [40] and a topological crystalline insulator SnTe [41]. For superconducting 
tellurides, high-pressure synthesis was used to stabilize the NaCl-type structure [42–44]. For example, 
the low-pressure phase of InTe has a TlSe-type structure, but the high-pressure phase of InTe has a 
NaCl-type structure. The high-pressure phase can be obtained by high-pressure synthesis [43,44]. 
Motivated by these facts, we tried to synthesize HEA-type tellurides MTe where the M site is in the 
HEA state (see Fig. 4(b) for crystal structure) by high-pressure synthesis. 
 
Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity for AgInSnPbBiTe5, 
in which the M site is evenly occupied by Ag, In, Sn, Pb, and Bi (five metals) [31]. Very small RRR 
was observed, which is a similar trend to that in HEA superconductors [18]. In addition, four different 
MTe (M: Ag, In, Cd, Sn, Sb, Pb, Bi) superconductors with a HEA-type site has been obtained [32]. 
Interestingly, there is a correlation between the lattice constant and Tc in HEA-type MTe. In Figure 
5(b), the data for typical MTe superconductors are plotted. It is found that the trend that Tc increases 
with increasing lattice constant is common among the plotted MTe. The Tcs of HEA-type are, however, 
lower than those of low-entropy tellurides, such as InTe and (In,Sn)Te. Therefore, the introduction of 
the HEA-type M site is found to negatively work for Tc in MTe. This negative effect would be due to 
the direct effect of strong disorder to the M-Te bonding states and hence electronic states.

2-2. Hybrid high-entropy alloying in MCh 
 
The Te site of MTe can be substituted by S and Se. The flexibility of both M and Te sites to 
element substitution enables us to design “hybrid HEA”, in which both sites are alloyed [33]. Figure 
6(a) shows the X-ray diffraction patterns for (Ag0.25In0.25Pb0.25Bi0.25)Te1-xSex. Notably, mixing many 
elements at two sites does not result in phase separation, and a single-phase sample was obtained for 
x = 0.25, while small impurity phases were detected for x = 0.5. For x = 0.25, as displayed in Fig. 6(b), 
the ΔSmix for the M and Ch sites are 1.38R and 0.51R, and the total ΔSmix reaches 1.89R. Furthermore, 
the total ΔSmix for x = 0.5 reaches 2.00R. These ΔSmix values are clearly higher than that for HEAs 
(Table I). Therefore, alloying at two or more sites (hybrid high-entropy alloying) results in very high 
total ΔSmix. 
 
The superconducting properties for (Ag0.25In0.25Pb0.25Bi0.25)Te1-xSex are shown in Fig. 6(c). 
A superconducting transition with Tc > 2 K was observed for x = 0 and 0.25. By focusing on these two 
phases, interesting trend was found. Although the Tc for x = 0.25 is lower than that for x = 0, the 
suppression of Tc for x = 0.25 under magnetic fields is clearly smaller than that for x = 0. From the 
estimation of upper critical field (Hc2), it was found that the Hc2 (0 K) for x = 0.25 is higher than that 
for x = 0. In addition, from the measurements of the magnetization-field loop, it was confirmed that 
the critical current density (Jc) at 1.8 K for x = 0.25 is larger than that for x = 0. These results suggest 


10 
 
that an increase in ΔSmix may be useful to improve Hc2 and/or Jc characteristics of superconductors if 
the problem on the suppression of Tc could be solved.

3. CuAl2-type TrZr2 
As shown in the last section, high-entropy alloying of a compound, which possesses two or 
more crystallographic sites, is a route to develop new superconductors with a high mixing entropy. In 
addition, in HEA-type compounds, not only the site entropy but also the entropy of chemical bonding 
states should be higher than normal alloys or compounds. To discover new HEA-type superconductors, 
the use of material database is quite useful. SuperCon (NIMS database) [45] is a database of 
superconductors and contain information of composition, structural type, Tc, and reference of the 
material. To achieve the material design of HEA-type superconductors, we have to find a system in 
which compositional variation is rich within the same structural type, and superconducting transition 
has been observed. Herein, we introduce an example of material design for new HEA-type 
superconductors. 
 
TrZr2 (Tr: transition metal) with a tetragonal CuAl2-type structure (Fig. 4(c)) is a 
superconducting system. For Tr = Fe, Co, Ni, Rh, Ir, superconductivity was reported. Among them, 
CoZr2, RhZr2, and IrZr2 exhibits a higher Tc of 5.5, 11.3, and 7.5 K, respectively [46]. Furthermore, 
the Tr site can be partially substituted by Sc, Cu, Ga, Pd, and Ta [34,45]. These facts suggest that the 
Tr site of TrZr2 can be modified into a HEA-type site. We synthesized Co0.2Ni0.1Cu0.1Rh0.3Ir0.3Zr2 by 
arc melting and observed superconductivity with a Tc of 8 K [34]. The Tr site of 
Co0.2Ni0.1Cu0.1Rh0.3Ir0.3Zr2 contains five transition metals, and the ΔSmix for the Tr site is about 1.5R. 
In addition, (Fe,Co,Ni,Rh,Ir)Zr2 superconductors were also synthesized and exhibited 
superconductivity [35]. Interestingly, the resulting Tc in HEA-type phases was very close to the 
weighted-average Tc of pure TrZr2 systems. Although the origin of the unexpected behavior is still 
unclear, the effects of disordering by the HEA-type site to superconducting properties seem very 
limited. The difference in the HEA effects between MCh and TrZr2 may be caused by the different 
structural complexity. 
As shown in Fig. 7(a), the temperature dependence of resistivity exhibits a relatively large 
RRR as compared to other HEA-type superconductors. However, a large RRR of ~30 was reported for 
CoZr2 single crystals [47], which is clearly larger than that for HEA-type TrZr2. Therefore, the HEA 
effects (disordering effects) to transport properties would be a common trend. Figure 7(b) shows the 
temperature dependences of the specific heat for Co0.2Ni0.1Cu0.1Rh0.3Ir0.3Zr2 in the form of C/T. 
Although a clear jump of C/T at the Tc is seen, the transition is broader as compared to the case of 
CoZr2. The trend of broad transition in specific heat at Tc was not observed in a HEA superconductor 
but observed in HEA-type compounds. Because the superconducting transitions observed in resistivity 
and magnetization were sharp, the broad transition in the specific heat would suggest microscopic 
local phase separation in HEA-type superconducting compounds.

4. Cuprate (high-Tc) superconductors REBa2Cu3O7-d 
As mentioned in introduction, cuprates (Cu oxides) have been extensively studied in the 
fields of science and engineering because of its high Tc. Among them, REBa2Cu3O7-d (RE123) system 
[5] is one of practical materials for superconductivity application. In addition, a high Jc was reported 
in RE123 samples with three elements at the RE site [48]. Motivated by the fact, we synthesized 
polycrystalline samples of REBa2Cu3O7-d with different ΔSmix for the RE site [36] by standard solid-
state reaction in air. In the study, two-step annealing was performed to optimize oxygen content (d) 
because oxygen content affect crystal structure (orthorhombicity) and superconducting properties of 
REBa2Cu3O7-d. A high superconducting property is generally achieved in an orthorhombic phase in 
the system, we estimated the orthorhombicity parameter (OP), which is given by 2|a-b|/(a+b), and 
plotted the estimated Tc and magnetic Jc (T = 2 K, B = 1 T) for REBa2Cu3O7-d as a function of OP as 
shown in Fig. 8. Note that the data points are colored according to the number of elements contained 
at the RE site. From the plot, it is found that Tc does not show a remarkable correlation with ΔSmix 
(RE site) and exhibits a clear correlation with OP. Jc also exhibits a trend of improvement with 
increasing OP. These facts suggest that disorder introduced by high-entropy alloying at the RE site 
(see Fig. 4(d)) does not largely affect superconducting properties of REBa2Cu3O7-d, which is a two-
dimensional layered compound. Because the trend is clearly different to that observed for cubic (NaCl-
type) tellurides with a HEA-type site, crystal-structure dimensionality is a key factor to how the 
introduction of HEA-type site affects superconducting properties in compounds.

2 K, B = 1 T) for REBa2Cu3O7-d. Original data has been published in Refs. 36. Copyright 2020

In Fig. 8(b), we found three data points for HEA-type samples show a Jc larger than that for 
the other low-entropy samples at OP = 0.01–0.015. Although it has not been fully clarified whether 
the slightly large Jcs in the HEA-type samples are caused by high-entropy alloying or not, the effect 
of high-entropy alloying for cuprates should be further studied to find the way to improve practical 
performance of cuprate superconductors. 
 
 
5. BiS2-based layered superconductors RE(O,F)BiS2 
BiS2-based superconductor family is one of the layered superconductor families and was 
discover in 2012 [49–51]. The crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of a conducting BiS2 
bilayer and a blocking layer (for example, a REO layer), which is similar to that of high-Tc systems. 
Furthermore, unconventional superconductivity has been proposed from theoretical and experimental 
studies on the BiS2-based compounds [51].  
A typical BiS2-based system is REOBiS2 (see Fig. 4(e)). Because non-doped REOBiS2 is a 
semiconductor, electron carrier doping is required to induce metallicity [50]. For RE = La, a 
superconducting transition was observed at 2.5 K after electron doping through partial substitution of 


14 
 
O by F in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. However, the superconductivity states in La(O,F)BiS2 is not bulk in nature. 
This is due to the presence of the local disorder due to Bi lone pairs, and the local disorder could be 
suppressed by in-plane chemical pressure effects [52–54]. In-plane chemical pressure can be generated 
by RE-site substitution by smaller RE ions or Se substitution for the S site. By increasing in-plane 
chemical pressure, local disorder is suppressed, and bulk superconductivity is induced [52,53]. 
Therefore, one can say that RE(O,F)BiS2 is a useful system to investigate the effect of structural 
modification on local crystal structure and superconducting properties. This suggests that the 
investigation of the effects of introduction of a HEA site in RE(O,F)BiS2 would provide us with key 
information about interlayer interaction through the HEA states.

Original data has been published in Refs. 37. Copyright 2020 by IOP. 
 
The HEA-type samples of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm were synthesized 
by solid-state reaction in an evacuated quartz tube [37]. Figures 9(a) and 9(b) show superconducting 
properties of four different HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples. The Tc varies depending on the RE-site 
composition. As shown in Fig. 9(c), these four samples have different lattice constants a, which is 


15 
 
corresponding to different in-plane chemical pressures. Therefore, the variation of Tc can be 
understood with the in-plane chemical pressure scenario. When focusing on the samples with the same 
lattice constant a and different mixing entropy, we find that the superconducting properties (Tc and 
Δ4πχ) of the HEA-type sample are higher than those of low-entropy samples (Figs. 9(c) and 9(d)). 
The facts indicate that an increase in ΔSmix for the RE site may positively work in improving 
superconducting properties. Therefore, we systematically prepared REO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples with the 
same lattice constant a and different ΔSmix to investigate the interlayer interaction [38].

of RE elements contained in the sample. (b) Schematic images of local structural disorder for 
low-entropy and HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. (c) Temperature dependences of 4πχ. (d) ΔSmix 
dependence of Δ4πχ (T = 2 K). Original data has been published in Refs. 38. Copyright 2020 by 
Elsevier. 
 
 
As summarized in Fig. 10(a), we succeeded in preparation of a set of five REO0.5F0.5BiS2 
samples with almost the same a and systematically varied ΔSmix. Because the lattice constant a nearly 
corresponds to the degree of the in-plane chemical pressure, the set of samples have almost similar in-
plane chemical pressure. Therefore, we could detect the effects of the increase in ΔSmix to 


16 
 
superconducting properties and local structural disorder [38]. Through magnetic susceptibility 
measurements, we confirmed that shielding volume fraction increases with increasing ΔSmix while the 
Tc does not change (Figs. 10(c) and 10(d)). To understand the origin of the improvement of 
superconducting properties, local structure was analyzed using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. As 
summarized in Fig. 10(b), suppression of in-plane structural disorder, which was detected by 
anisotropic displacement parameter for the in-plane direction (U11), was achieved by the HEA effect 
at the RE site. Similar trend was observed in another set of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples with larger lattice 
constant (comparable to that of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2). The results propose that high-entropy alloying at the 
blocking layer would modify the local structure at the conducting layer in BiS2-based layered 
compounds. This effect should be a new strategy to develop novel functional materials with a layered 
structure. 
 
 
6. Conclusion 
In this chapter, we reviewed the works on HEA superconductors and HEA-type 
superconducting compounds, which have been developed applying the HEA concept in simple alloys 
to more complicated compounds. By introducing a HEA-type site (or alloying multi sites) in a 
compound, a high mixing entropy can be achieved. HEA-type compounds would have a high mixing 
entropy at the alloyed site and a highly (randomly) disordered bonding states. For a three-dimensional 
system, such as NaCl-type chalcogenides, introduction of the HEA-type M site in MCh resulted in 
suppression of Tc, but, at the same time, slight enhancements of Hc2 and Jc were observed. For 
tetragonal (CuAl2-type) TrZr2, the introduction of the HEA-type site does not suppress Tc. Furthermore, 
for layered systems, such as REBa2Cu3O7-d cuprates and BiS2-based RE0.5F0.5BiS2, high-entropy 
alloying rather improves their superconducting properties. Through investigations of the HEA effects 
to superconducting and structural properties for HEA-type compounds with different structural types, 
we conclude that the HEA effects are highly depending on the structural dimensionality. Hence, to 
effectively use the HEA effect to improve superconducting properties of compounds, target structure 
should be lower-symmetric, a layered structure or a one-dimensional structure. To obtain further 
knowledge about the presence/absence of local phase separations, pinning characteristics, and the 
HEA effect to superconducting pairing states, further investigations on HEA-type superconducting 
compounds using various probes are required.
