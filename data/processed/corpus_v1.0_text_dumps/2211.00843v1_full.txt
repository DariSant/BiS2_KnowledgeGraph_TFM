Abstract 
 We report transport properties for layered BiCh2-based (Ch = S, Se) superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2-
ySey (x = 0.2, 0.5, y = 0–1.05) and the observation of weak antilocalization (WAL). Electrical resistivity 
and Hall coefficients for the Se-poor samples increase with decreasing temperature. The increase 
becomes less pronounced with increasing Se concentration indicating a loss of insulating behavior. 
Interestingly, the moderately Se-substituted samples exhibit metallic behavior in the high-temperature 
region and a weak increase in the resistivity in the low-temperature regions, which indicates the 
existence of carrier localization. The heavily Se-substituted compounds show metallic behavior in the 
entire-temperature region. Sign changes of the Hall coefficients are observed for the x = 0.2 samples, 
which possibly is related to a charge-density wave (CDW). Magnetoresistance measurements indicate 
that WAL is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened by the 
changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of the WAL and WL emerges around the 
moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of the resistivity behavior by the F and 
Se substitution clearly correlates to the difference of the magnetoconductance. Moreover, the 
localization regions of the WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the 
CDW. We propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform for studying relationship between 
WAL, superconductivity, and electronic ordering because those states are tunable by element 
substitutions with bulk single crystals.

Significance 
Weak antilocalization (WAL) is an important quantum phenomenon, and strong spin-orbit coupling 
is essential for WAL states to emerge. Studies of WAL largely focus on two-dimensional materials 
and thus WAL research on bulk single crystals is limited. Here, we find that typical WAL signatures, 
such as sharp cusps in the low-field magnetoresistance, are observed for bulk single crystals of layered 
BiCh2-based superconductors. The WAL states are gradually suppressed and a crossover of WAL and 
weak localization is induced by element substitution. Moreover, the change of the 
magnetoconductance clearly correlates with the modification of the resistivity and Hall coefficient by 
elemental substitution. Our findings suggest that BiCh2-based superconductors are good platforms for 
investigating the relationship between localization and superconductivity. 
 
 
Introduction 
Weak antilocalization (WAL) has been extensively studied in topological-materials and spintronics 
[1–6]. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) basically leads to WAL [7, 8]. A crossover from WAL to 
weak localization (WL) may be induced by changing parameters, such as impurity, elemental-
substitution, and carrier concentration [1, 3, 5]. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have been the central 
target for the WAL and WL. Here, we propose that the layered BiCh2-based (Ch = S, Se) 
superconductors are novel candidate system for studying the WAL and WL in spite of being bulk 
single crystals.  
BiCh2-based superconductors have a layered crystal structure composed of blocking layers and BiCh2 
conducting layers [9, 10]. The typical BiCh2-based system is REOBiCh2-type (RE = Rare earth) [Fig. 
1(a)] and the parent compound is a band insulator [10–14]. F substitution for O sites leads to electron-
carrier doping, and superconductivity emerges at low temperatures (the superconducting transition 
temperature Tc ~ 2–10 K) [10–14], which is in a certain way similar to the situation in iron-based 
superconductors REOFeAs [15]. The Bi-6px/py orbitals largely contribute to the electronic properties 
since the conduction bands are mainly composed of these orbitals [16–18]. For the REO1-xFxBiCh2-
type system, rectangular electron pockets are found at the X points up to x ~ 0.45 [19–21]. By 
increasing x, a Lifshitz transition takes place around x ~ 0.45, and hole pockets emerge around the  
and M points [20, 21]. 
As regards the superconducting state, theoretical calculations suggest that an unconventional Cooper 
pairing mechanism and anisotropic superconducting gap structures can be realized in the BiCh2-based 
system [16, 18]. However, many experimental results, such as the magnetic penetration depth, specific 
heat, and thermal conductivity, provided evidence that superconductivity is of the conventional 
isotropic s-wave type [22–25]. The residual resistivity is in the order of mcm, even in single 
crystalline samples, which indicates that superconductivity occurs in the dirty limit. The robustness 


3 
 
against impurities can support the conventional isotropic s-wave scenario. In contrast, in an angle-
resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study an anisotropic superconducting gap with 
nodelike minima was directly observed, which suggested that anisotropic s-wave superconductivity 
with accidental nodes can be realized in the BiCh2-based system [26]. Moreover, the isotope effect 
exponent  in the BiCh2-based systems strikingly deviates from the standard BCS value of  ~ 0.5 
which possibly indicates an unconventional Cooper pairing mechanism [27, 28]. A checkerboard 
stripe pattern observed by scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) may as well be 
related to an unconventional pairing mechanism [29, 30]. A relevant feature of the tetragonal crystal 
structure of the BiCh2-based compounds (space group P4/nmm, No. 129) is that it has local inversion 
symmetry breaking in the BiCh2 layer, which can cause a spin polarization on the Fermi surface (FS) 
due to the local Rashba-type SOC [31]. A spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy 
(SARPES) study directly found a Rashba-like spin texture near the Fermi level [32]. Furthermore, the 
unique spin texture can lead to the protection of the Cooper pairs from depairing due to a magnetic 
field, and a suppression of the paramagnetic pair-breaking effect. More recently, extremely high upper 
critical fields were reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey (y = 0.22 and 0.69), which indicates that the 
Rashba-type spin texture plays a significant role in superconductivity [33]. This provides strong 
evidence that an unconventional superconducting state can be realized in the BiCh2-based system.  
Although the superconducting properties have been intensively investigated in the BiCh2-based 
compounds, there is an unresolved problem in the normal-state-resistivity behavior. In previous 
experimental results on LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, a weak increase of the resistivity was observed, although 
superconductivity emerges at low temperature [11, 34]. The experimental results are not consistent 
with the theoretical calculations since the Fermi level crosses the conduction band for the doping level 
x = 0.5 and thus metallic behavior should emerge [18, 19]. Furthermore, the shielding volume fraction 
estimated from magnetization measurements is less than 10%, which indicates superconductivity in 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is filamentary in nature [10, 11, and SI Appendix, Fig. S3]. Se substitution leads to the 
gradual suppression of the upward behavior in the resistivity and heavily Se-doped LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe 
shows almost metallic behavior and bulk superconductivity (the shielding fraction is roughly 100%) 
[10, 34, and SI Appendix, Fig. S3]. The Se-substitution effect is considered to act as chemical pressure, 
which leads to the depression of the in-plane disorder [10, 35]. These results imply that a localization 
phenomenon is in play that can be suppressed by Se substitution. Sakai et al. suggested that similar 
localized states, reported for Sr1-xLaxFBiS2, which is closely related to LaO1-xFxBiS2, may be due to 
Anderson localization [36]. If the states are related to Anderson localization, a negative 
magnetoresistance (MR) is expected. However, MR data were not reported in the previous work. This 
justifies a systematic study to address the localization phenomena in BiCh2-based systems by means 
of magnetotransport. 
Here, we report the transport properties of single crystalline LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey (x = 0.2, 0.5, y = 0–


4 
 
1.05). An insulating behavior is observed for moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. Heavily 
F-doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows superconductivity at low temperature although a weak increase in the 
resistance is still observed. The increase is progressively depressed with increasing Se concentration 
for both x = 0.2 and 0.5. The moderately Se-substituted samples exhibit metallic behavior in the high-
temperature region and superconductivity at low temperatures. The weak increase in the resistivity 
still exists at low-temperatures, which implies the existence of localized states. Metallic behavior in 
the entire temperature region emerges in the heavily Se-substituted compounds for both x = 0.2 and 
0.5. The Hall coefficients in the low-temperature region are also depressed with increasing Se 
concentration, in accordance with the resistivity data. Moreover, sign changes of the Hall coefficients 
are observed for x = 0.2, which may relate to a charge-density wave (CDW). To further investigate the 
localization state, we performed MR measurements. Sharp cusps of the MR in the low-field regions 
are observed in the heavily Se-substituted compounds, which indicates the WAL state emerge. The 
WAL is weakened for the moderately Se-substituted compounds, as well as for heavily F-doped and 
Se-free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (we call this weak WAL in the following). Furthermore, a WAL-WL crossover 
is found in moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The experimental results are almost 
consistent with a theoretical prediction which suggests that a crossover from WAL to WL occurs when 
the Fermi energy or band gap changes [8]. The electronic band structures from the theoretical 
calculations and ARPES spectra clearly show that Se substitution leads to decreasing the band gap. 
The change from the WAL to weak WAL and the WAL-WL crossover by the F and/or Se substitution 
obviously correlate with the results of the resistivity and Hall coefficient. Therefore, the elemental 
substitution of F and Se in the BiCh2-based system leads to changing the localization states with 
controlling the Fermi energy and band gap. Moreover, it may be significant to suppress the local crystal 
disorder to cause the WAL states, given the previous studies. The localization states of the weak WAL 
and the WAL-WL crossover may be associated with the CDW.  
 
Results and discussion 
Figure 1(a) shows the crystal structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey which is a layered material composed of 
La(O/F) blocking layers and BiCh2 conducting layers. The Se in this system is selectively substituted 
at the Ch1 sites [37]. Figures 1(b) and (c) present the temperature dependence of the electrical 
resistivity in the ab-plane ab for x = 0.2 and x = 0.5, respectively. For x = 0.2 [Fig. 1(b)], Se-free 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 (x = 0.2, y = 0) exhibits insulating behavior in the entire temperature range. The 
insulating behavior is gradually suppressed with increasing Se concentration, and superconductivity 
is observed at low temperatures for y = 0.46, 0.72, and 0.94. However, a weak increase of ab in the 
low-temperature region is still seen for y = 0.46 and 0.72, while in the high-temperature region metallic 
behavior is observed. When the Se-substitution level reaches y = 0.94, metallic behavior is found in 
the entire temperature range. The x = 0.5 samples [Fig. 1 (c)] show a trend similar to the x = 0.2 


5 
 
samples. However, there is a clear difference between the Se-free samples: LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 (x = 0.5, y 
= 0) shows a superconducting transition at T ~ 2 K, while LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 (x = 0.2, y = 0) is insulating 
behavior in the entire temperature range down to 2 K. In addition, the absolute value of ab at low 
temperatures for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is much smaller than that of LaO0.8F0.2BiS2, despite the weakly 
insulating behavior for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. These results indicate that electron-carrier doping (F 
substitution) suppresses the insulating characteristics, but a F content x = 0.2 is not sufficient to 
suppress the insulating state completely. However, heavily Se-substituted LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.06Se0.94 (x = 
0.2, y = 0.94) with the same nominal x = 0.2 shows metallic behavior and superconductivity. Moreover, 
theoretical calculations suggest that a doping level of x = 0.2 should be sufficient to make the BiCh2-
based system metallic [18, 19]. The moderately Se-substituted samples (y = 0.46 and 0.72 with x = 0.2 
and y = 0.39 and 0.65 with x = 0.5) exhibit metallic behavior in the high-temperature region, but a 
weak increase in ab at low-temperatures. Hence, we can deduce that carrier localization occurs in 
these compositions. Thus, the LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 phase is not a conventional band insulator but an 
insulator caused by carrier localization. A similar localization state was observed for polycrystalline 
samples of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2, which compares well to our target material LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey [36]. The 
authors of Ref. 36 suggested that the weak increase in ab is due to Anderson localization. We will 
discuss this possibility in the section with the MR results. 
To further investigate the physical properties in the normal states, we performed Hall resistivity 
measurements. Figures 1(d) and (e) show the temperature dependence of the Hall coefficient RH for x 
= 0.2 and x = 0.5, respectively. As shown in the inset of Fig. 1(e), our experimental results show single-
band behavior, i.e. a linear function H(B), although multiband-like behavior [nonlinear H(B)] was 
reported for BiCh2-based compounds in previous studies [38, 39]. Note that in the present work we 
use single crystals, while in the previous experiments [38, 39] the data were obtained on 
polycrystalline samples, which might cause some differences. We determined the Hall coefficient RH 
from the linear slope of H (B). RH increases with decreasing temperature for x = 0.2 and 0.5. The 
increasing behavior, is systematically depressed by increasing Se concentration, analogous to the ab 
(T) behavior in Figs. 1(b) and (c). For the x = 0.2 samples [Fig. 1(d)], sign changes of RH from negative 
to positive are observed for y = 0, 0.24, 0.47, and 0.72. In contrast, a negative RH is kept until 5 K for 
heavily Se-substituted LaO0.8F0.2BiS0.95Se1.05 (x = 0.2, y = 1.05), which indicates that electron-type 
carriers are dominant in the entire temperature region for this compound. For the x = 0.5 samples [Fig. 
1(e)], the RH (T) curves are similar to those for x = 0.2. However, heavily Se-substituted 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.09Se0.91 (x = 0.5, y = 0.91) shows a positive sign of RH throughout the entire temperature 
region, which implies that hole-type carriers are predominant for that compound. According to the 
theoretical calculations for the FS topology of the BiCh2-based system, the electron pockets around 
the X points exist up to x ~ 0.45, and hole pockets around the  and M points emerge above x > 0.45 
[20, 21]. Therefore, the negative RH (electron-type carriers) for LaO0.8F0.2BiS0.95Se1.05 and the positive 


6 
 
RH (hole-type carriers) for x = 0.5 in the low-temperature region are in line with the theoretical work. 
However, the sign changes and the hole-type carriers at low temperatures observed for y = 0–0.72 in 
x = 0.2 are not consistent with the theoretical expectations. A similar sign-change behavior of RH was 
observed in polycrystalline EuFBiS2, which was attributed to a CDW [40]. In our experiments, the 
sign changes in RH are observed concomitant with the upward behavior of ab (T), which is 
incompatible with a conventional CDW scenario by FS nesting. However, the nonmetallic behavior 
probably does not originate from a conventional band insulator, since superconductivity is observed 
even when ab (T) increases at low temperatures. In addition, a recent synchrotron radiation X-ray 
diffraction study suggested the formation of a CDW below T ~ 260 K in single crystals of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [41]. Besides there are several theoretical papers in which a CDW for the BiCh2-based 
compounds is suggested [42, 43]. Thus, the sign changes in RH for our crystals may relate to the CDW 
formation. Moreover, the sign-change temperature progressively decrease, and the values of the 
positive RH in the low-temperature regions are also systematically depressed with increasing Se 
concentration. Therefore, together with the results of the ab (T) measurements, we speculate that the 
RH data point to carrier localization in the Se-free and moderately Se-substituted compounds and that 
this may be linked to the CDW. The indication of the hole-type carriers in the low-temperature regions 
for the y = 0–0.72 in the x = 0.2 results from the localization where a negative RH should result from 
the carrier doping level. For x = 0.5, the sign-change behavior is observed only for y = 0.19. It may be 
difficult to observe the sign change in the x = 0.5 case, since basically, the hole-type carriers are 
predominant in the carrier-doping level. Alternatively, the temperature dependence of the Hall 
coefficients for x = 0.5 has almost the same tendency with increasing Se concentration as x = 0.2. 
Therefore, we expect that the CDW might also be present in the x = 0.5 samples. The carrier density 
n at low temperatures, estimated from n = 1/|RHe|, changes from the order of 1019 cm-3 to 1021 cm-3 by 
Se substitution in x = 0.2 and from the order of 1019 cm-3 to 1020 cm-3 in x = 0.5.  
To further investigate the localization behavior deduced from ab (T) and RH (T), we performed MR 
measurements. If Anderson localization is realized in the BiCh2-based systems as suggested in a 
previous study [36], a negative MR should be observed in the localization regime [44, 45].  Figures 2 
(a)–(d) show the MR defined as MR = [ab (B) – ab (0)]/ab  (0) × 100% as a function of magnetic 
field for y = 0 and 1.05 with x = 0.2, and y = 0 and 0.91 with x = 0.5, at T = 5 K and 7.5 K, respectively. 
The observed MR is clearly different from the negative magnetoresistance expected from the 
Anderson localization scenario. The MR curves for the heavily Se-substituted compounds in x = 0.2 
and 0.5 show sharp cusps in low magnetic field at T = 5 K. The sharp dip of the MR in low field is a 
characteristic feature of WAL which has been observed in various materials with strong SOC [1–4]. 
This is consistent with the previous ARPES observation that SOC gives a pronounced effect on the 
band structure of La(O,F)BiS2 [46]. The low-field MR curves for heavily F-doped and Se-free 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 become broad and close to classical quadratic in field behavior. Moderately F-doped 


7 
 
and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 exhibit an almost flat MR in low fields. By increasing the applied field, a 
maximum around B = 3 T is observed, resulting in a negative MR at even higher fields. This indicates 
that the WL state emerges in the high-field region. At T = 7.5 K [Figs. 2(c) and (d)], the WAL for the 
heavily Se-substituted samples with x = 0.2 and 0.5 is weakened, and the WL behavior in the high 
fields becomes clear for moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. To clearly exhibit the WAL, 
we correct the MR to the magnetoconductance G (MC) defined as the G (B) = G (B) – G (0). Figures 
2(e)–(h) show the low-field MC as a function of magnetic field at T = 5 K [Figs. 2(e) and (f)] and 7.5 
K [Figs. 2(g) and (h)]. We just show positive-field regions to analyze the MC data. The MR curves 
for moderately Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65 (x = 0.5, y = 0.65) and LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.28Se0.72 (x 
= 0.2, y = 0.72) are displayed in SI Appendix, Fig. S2. At T = 5 K, the MC curves for the heavily Se-
substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.09Se0.91 and LaO0.8F0.2BiS0.95Se1.05 steeply decrease with increasing 
magnetic 
fields. 
The

observed 
for 
moderately 
Se-substituted 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.28Se0.72, LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65, and also heavily F-doped and Se-free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, 
but the decline of the MC is gradually suppressed with decreasing Se concentration. The MC for 
moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 is almost independent of the magnetic field. The MC 
curves at T = 7.5 K have a similar trend as those at T = 5 K. The experimental results indicate that the 
heavily Se-substituted samples exhibit the WAL state, which is weakened in the moderately Se-
substituted compounds and heavily F-doped and Se-free La0.5F0.5BiS2. Furthermore, the almost flat 
MC behavior for moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 implies a WAL-WL crossover takes 
place. Basically, the 2D MC of the WAL contribution is described by the Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka 
(HLN) formula [7]. To quantitatively analyze the MC curves and compare them with previous studies 
of WAL, we fit the data with the 2D HLN formula written as  
                                            Δ𝐺= 𝛼𝑒2
2𝜋2ℏ[𝜓(1
2 +

4𝑒𝑙𝜙
2 𝐵) −ln (
ℏ
4𝑒𝑙𝜙
2 𝐵)],                                                 (1) 
where  is prefactor, l is the phase coherence length, and  is the digamma function. The solid lines 
in Figs. 2(e)–(h) represent the HLN fitting. The MC data can be well fitted by the HLN model except 
for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 at T = 7.5 K [red solid line in Fig. 2(g)]. The coefficient of determination R2 for this 
compound is less than 80% in spite of over 95% for the others [SI Appendix, Table S2]. This is 
probably due to the WAL-WL crossover state. The obtained values of  and l are displayed in Figs. 
4 (c) and (d). The magnitudes of  are in the order of 104, except for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2, which is much 
larger than reported for 2D compounds [1–4]. Such huge values of  have been observed in three-
dimensional (3D) bulk systems and are considered to derive from the 3D bulk contribution [47–50]. 
Thus, we speculate that the large values of  in our systems are due to the 3D bulk nature of the single 
crystals. On the other hand, the obtained l is comparable to the values found in previous studies for 
both 2D and 3D bulk compounds. The absolute values of  and l systematically increase with 
increasing Se concentration [see Figs. 4(c) and (d)], which indicates that the WAL behavior emerges 


8 
 
by Se substitution. Furthermore, the order of  for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 is 104 times smaller than in the other 
samples, which implies that this compound is in the WAL-WL crossover states. A similar evolution 
of  by doping was observed for Bi2-xCrxSe3 and the sign-change behavior of  from negative to 
positive was regarded as the crossover from WAL to WL [3]. We analyzed the data with the HLN 
model so far, but a recent theoretical calculation about the WAL may be useful for our experimental 
results. The theoretical work which considered the strong SOC in the atoms that constitute the lattice 
(denoted as SOC lattice in Ref. 8) suggested that the WAL-WL crossover is realized by adjusting the 
ratio of the Fermi energy EF to the band gap Eg [8]. In the BiCh2-based system, several electronic-
band calculations suggest that Eg decreases by Se substitution [51, 52]. Since the F substitution causes 
electron-carrier doping, the elemental-substitution effect of Se and F leads to controlling EF and Eg in 
the BiCh2-based system, which contributes to the change of the MC. Moreover, the predicted G (B) 
for the Bi1-xSbx alloy [8], in which EF of semi metallic Bi can be changed by Sb substitution, is alike 
the observed MC [Figs. 4(e)–(h)]. Thus, we expect that the change from the WAL to weak WAL and 
the WAL-WL crossover can be controlled by the elemental substitution of F and Se in the BiCh2-
based system and that the localization states observed in ab (T) and RH (T) [Figs. 2 and 3] can be 
associated with the MC behavior.  
To confirm the scenario on the changes of the MC behavior by controlling EF and Eg by Se 
substitution, we consider the electronic band structures. Figures 3(a) and (b) exhibit the calculated 
electronic band structure for Se-free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and heavily Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The 
band gap at the X point clearly decreases with Se substitution. Moreover, Figs. 3(c) and (d) show the 
ARPES spectra for our single crystals of Se-free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and heavily Se-substituted 
LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The observed band gap values at the X point were estimated to be 0.875 eV for Se-
free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 0.715 eV for heavily Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The tendency of the 
change of the band gap observed in ARPES is consistent with the theoretical calculations. In addition, 
the spectral intensity at EF of Se-free LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is strongly reduced compared to that of heavily 
Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe [see Fig. 3(e)], which is consistent with the localized and non-localized 
nature of the samples. Thus, the electronic band structure from the theoretical calculations and ARPES 
supports the results of the transport properties.  
Next, we discuss a clear maximum of the MR for moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. 
The theoretical calculation suggested that there is no minimum of G (B) (no maximum of the MR) 
as a function of the field in the SOC lattice, while a clear minimum of the G (B) (maximum of the 
MR) is observed in conventional HLN theory, which considers a 2D metal with strong spin-orbit 
coupled impurities [8]. We have not found any specific impurities in our single crystal samples (we 
confirmed that the actual atomic ratios are almost consistent with the nominal values although we 
cannot wholly determine that there are no impurities), but moderately F-doped and Se-free 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 probably have disorder originating from local crystal distortions caused by structural 


9 
 
instability due to the presence of Bi lone pairs [35]. The crystal structure of the parent compound has 
a monoclinic symmetry (space group P21/m) [53], and the tetragonal structure is gradually stabilized 
by the F substitution (electron-carrier doping) [54, 55]. Moreover, the Se-substitution effect causes the 
depression of the local disorder in the BiCh1 plane [35]. Thus, moderately F-doped and Se-free 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 still have local distortions, which may lead to the clear maximum of the MR. On the 
basis of the discussion here, we propose that the BiCh2-based LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey compounds provide 
a new platform where the WAL states are realized when the structural disorder is removed by Se 
substitution. 
In Figs. 4(a) and (b), we summarize the electronic phases of LaO0.8F0.2BiS2-ySey and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-
ySey as functions of y and temperature. For x = 0.2 [Fig. 4(a)], the ab (T) behavior for y = 0 
demonstrates an insulating behavior in the entire temperature region [blue region in Fig. 4(a)]. The 
insulating behavior is gradually suppressed with increasing Se concentration, and superconductivity 
emerges for y = 0.46, 0.72, and 0.94, although the weak increase in ab (T) is still observed for y = 
0.46 and 0.72 (denoted as Weakly insulating in Fig. 4). There is no strong correlation between y and 
Tc in x = 0.2. When the Se-substitution level reaches y = 0.94, the ab (T) curve exhibits the metallic 
behavior in the whole-temperature region (yellow regions in Fig. 4). The Tmin and T* [the definition is 
described in the caption of Fig. (4)] progressively decline with increasing Se concentration, and the 
sign change disappears for y = 1.05, which indicates that the localization state is suppressed by the Se 
substitution. The normalized resistivity ab (5 K)/ab (295 K) and the Hall coefficients at T = 5 K and 
100 K systematically decrease with increasing Se concentration as shown in Figs. 4(c) and (d). The 
magnitude of  and l in the HLN model increases with increasing Se concentration, which implies 
that the WAL state emerges for y = 1.05 and it is weakened for y = 0.72 [denoted as Weak WAL in 
Fig. 4]. Furthermore, the absolute value of  for Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 is much smaller than the others, 
which indicates that the WAL-WL crossover state is realized. The electronic phase diagram for x = 
0.5 [Fig. 4(b)] is similar to the one for x = 0.2; however, y = 0 in the x = 0.5 case presents 
superconductivity at T ~ 2 K, although ab(T) exhibits a weakly insulating behavior. The largest 
absolute values of  and l for y = 0.91 in the x = 0.5 samples imply the WAL characteristics [see Fig. 
4(d)]. The WAL is diminished for LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Therefore, the change of 
the MC behavior by the F and Se substitution is associated with the ab (T) behavior for both x = 0.2 
and 0.5. The Tc for x = 0.5 monotonically increases with increasing Se concentration, which is different 
from the x = 0.2 case. The distinct behavior may originate from the FS topology, since theoretical 
studies propose that the superconducting gap structure and the Tc change with the transition from the 
electron-pocket FSs (x < 0.45) around the X points to hole-pocket FSs (x > 0.45) around the  and M 
points [56]. The localization state described as insulating or weakly insulating and WAL-WL-
crossover or weak WAL regions (blue regions and green regions in Fig. 4) may relate to the CDW as 


10 
 
discussed in the section above on the Hall coefficient, although we cannot completely determine the 
transition temperature of the CDW. However, we believe that the Tmin and T* are clues for revealing 
the physics where the localization states and superconductivity coexist in the BiCh2-based compounds.  
In conclusion, we have investigated the transport properties for the BiCh2-based system LaO1-
xFxBiS2-ySey (x = 0.2 and 0.5, y = 0–1.05). The ab (T) behavior and RH (T) suggest the existence of 
unique localization sates. The localization behavior is systematically depressed with increasing Se 
concentration. MR measurements indicate that WAL is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. 
The WAL behavior is weakened by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of WAL 
and WL emerges around moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of the MC 
behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates with the results of ab (T) and RH (T). Moreover, 
the localization regions of the WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with 
the CDW. On the basis of the results shown here, we propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good 
platform to study unique localization states, including WAL, and its relation to SOC, electronic 
ordering, and superconductivity by using the elemental substitution with bulk single crystals.  
 
 
Materials and Methods 
The single crystals of LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey were prepared by a high-temperature flux method by using 
a mixture of CsCl and KCl (CsCl:KCl = 5:3) as flux [59, 60]. We first synthesized polycrystalline 
samples by a conventional solid-state-reaction method [34, 35]. The obtained polycrystalline samples 
(0.4 g) and the flux (5.0 g) were mixed by a mortar and sealed into evacuated quartz tubes. The tubes 
were kept at 950 C˚ for 10 hours and slowly cooled to 600 C˚ at a rate of -2 C˚/h. The heated tubes 
were opened in air and the obtained products were washed and filtered by pure water to remove the 
flux. The actual compositions of the obtained single crystals were estimated by energy-dispersive X-
ray spectroscopy (EDX) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) TM-3030 (Hitachi High-Tech). 
The Se concentration y was estimated by the EDX. We use the nominal x-value in this study since the 
O and F concentration cannot be analyzed by the EDX due to their light mass. X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
was performed by a Miniflex600 (RIGAKU). The powder XRD patterns for polycrystalline samples 
were refined by the Rietveld analysis by using RIETAN-FP software [61] and the profiles for single 
crystalline samples were analyzed by PDIndexer software [62]. The lattice constants a and c for the 
polycrystalline and single crystals are displayed in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. The crystal structure image 
was prepared by VESTA [63].  
The electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity, and magnetoresistance measurements on the single-
crystalline samples were performed by a conventional four-terminal method in a physical properties 
measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) and a GM refrigerator (AXIS).  
We performed first-principles band-structure calculation based on the density functional theory with 


11 
 
the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation [64] and the 
projector augmented wave (PAW) method [65] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation 
package [66-69]. We used the experimental crystal structures determined by our experiment [70]. To 
represent the O0.5F0.5 occupation in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, one oxygen and one fluorine 
atom are placed in a 10-atom unit cell. For simplicity, we assumed that selenium atoms occupy in-
plane chalcogen sites in LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The core electrons in the PAW potential were [Kr]4d10 for 
La, [He] for O and F, [Xe]4f145d10 for Bi, [Ne] for S, and [Ar]3d10 for Se, respectively. The spin-orbit 
coupling was included. We took 500 eV of the cutoff energy for the wave function, a 14×14×4 k-mesh, 
and 0.15 eV of the Gaussian smearing width.  
 ARPES measurements were performed at BL-9A in the Hiroshima Synchrotron Radiation Center 
(HiSOR) using a R4000 electron analyzer (Scienta Omicron) with p-polarized light. The total energy 
resolution was set to approximately 30 meV for hν = 30 eV. All samples were cleaved in-situ on the 
(001) plane in an ultrahigh vacuum of less than 5 × 10-9 Pa. All the measurements were performed at 
the same temperature of 13 K. The binding energies of the samples were determined by referencing 
the Fermi energy (EF) of gold electronically contacted with samples.

S1. Lattice constants 
We performed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements for polycrystalline samples and single crystals 
of BiCh2-based LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey and analyzed the XRD patterns to estimate the lattice constants. The 
refined lattice constants a and c for the polycrystalline samples and single crystals are plotted in Fig. 
S1 (a) and (b). Note that we present only the c-axis lattice constant for the single crystals because only 
the 00l peaks were used for the refinement. The a-axis lattice parameter increases with increasing Se 
concentration since the ionic radius of Se is larger than that of S. The c-axis lattice constant of x = 0.5 
is smaller than of x = 0.2 since the electron-carrier doping (F substitution) is greatly sensitive to 
changing the c-axis length in the BiCh2-based system [1, 2]. Thus, there are slight variations of the c-
axis lengths with the Se concentration because the lattice constant c is dependent on both F and Se 
concentration. The trend of the c-axis parameters of the single crystals with the Se concentration is in 
good agreement with that of the polycrystalline samples. Moreover, the actual compositions from the 
EDX results are nearly consistent with the nominal compositions. The results indicate that the F and 
Se concentrations are successfully controlled in our single crystals.

polycrystalline samples (closed red circles for x = 0.2 and blue squares for x = 0.5) and single crystals

S2. Magnetoresistance measurements for moderately Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65 and 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.28Se0.72 
 We display magnetoresistance (MR) data for moderately Se-substituted LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.28Se0.72 (x = 
0.2, y = 0.72) and LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65 (x = 0.5, y = 0.72) at T = 5 K [Figs. S2(a) and (b)] and T = 
7.5 K [Figs. S2(c) and (d)]. The low-field MR curves at T = 5 K have a cusp-like behavior, which 
indicates weak antilocalization (WAL) states. However, the MR is broadened compared with the 
heavily Se-substituted compounds [Fig. 2(b)]. Thus, we deduce that the moderately Se-substituted 
systems are in weak WAL states.

S3. Magnetization measurements 
We performed magnetization measurements to estimate the shielding volume fractions for the LaO1-
xFxBiS2-ySey samples. Figures S3(a) and (b) show the temperature dependence of the magnetic 
susceptibility under H = 1 Oe for x = 0.2 and 0.5, respectively. The demagnetization factor N is large 
in this study since our single crystals have a plate-like shape and the applied magnetic field is parallel 
to the c axis (perpendicular to the plate surface) [3, 4]. Thus, we corrected the diamagnetic signal by 
considering the demagnetization effect and the estimated N is displayed in Table S1. The observed Tc 
is almost consistent with the resistivity measurements [see Fig. 1(b) and (c) in main text]. The shielding 
fraction after demagnetization correction increase with increasing Se concentration [see Fig. S3(c)], 
which is comparable to the results obtained on of polycrystals [5]. The magnetic susceptibility for 
LaO0.8F0.2BiS1.28Se0.72, LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.35Se0.65, and LaO0.5F0.5BiS1.06Se0.94 slightly exceeds the perfect 
diamagnetism (4 = -1) probably because of the existence of tiny single crystals on the main single-
crystalline sample. These results demonstrate that the Se substitution is essential for bulk 
superconductivity to emerge, which supports the scenario that the metallic behavior in the entire 
temperature regions and WAL states emerge in the heavily Se-substituted compounds, and it is 
suppressed with decreasing Se concentration. (see main text).

(a) x = 0.2 and (b) x = 0.5, respectively. The applied magnetic field is parallel to the c axis. Color

enlarged magnetic-susceptibility curves around the superconducting transition. (c) Magnetic 
susceptibility at T = 1.8 K as a function of the Se concentration y for x = 0.2 (red circles) and x = 0.5

S4. Fitting parameters in the HLN formula 
We use the 2D Hikami-Larkin-Nagaoka (HLN) formula (Eq. 1 in the main text) [6] to fit the MC 
data for LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey. There are two fitting parameters in the HLN model: the prefactor  and 
phase coherence length l. These parameters and the coefficient of determination R2 in the HLN fitting 
are summarized in Table S2. Over 95% of R2 is obtained except for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 at T = 7.5 K, which 
exhibits that the MC curves are well-fitted with the HLN formula. The R2 value for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 at 
T = 7.5 K is roughly 75% probably due to the WAL-WL crossover state for this compound. The fact 
that the obtained value of  for LaO0.8F0.2BiS2 is much smaller than the others can provide the evidence 
of WAL-WL crossover state for this compound. Se substitution leads to an increase in the absolute 
value of  and l, which indicates that the WAL state emerges by the Se substitution. We plot the Se-
concentration dependence of these parameters in Figs. 4(c) and (d) in the main text.
