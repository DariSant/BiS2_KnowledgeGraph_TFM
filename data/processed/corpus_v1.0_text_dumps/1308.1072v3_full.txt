Abstract.
Measurements of electrical resistivity were performed between 3 and
300 K at various pressures up to 2.8 GPa on the BiS2-based superconductors
LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
(Ln
=
Pr,
Nd).
At
lower
pressures,
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2
and
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibit superconductivity with critical temperatures Tc of 3.5 and
3.9 K, respectively. As pressure is increased, both compounds undergo a transition
at a pressure Pt from a low Tc superconducting phase to a high Tc superconducting
phase in which Tc reaches maximum values of 7.6 and 6.4 K for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, respectively. The pressure-induced transition is characterized by a
rapid increase in Tc within a small range in pressure of ∼0.3 GPa for both compounds.
In the normal state of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, the transition pressure Pt correlates with the
pressure where the suppression of semiconducting behaviour saturates. In the normal
state of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, Pt is coincident with a semiconductor-metal transition. This
behaviour is similar to the results recently reported for the LnO0.5F 0.5BiS2 (Ln = La,
Ce) compounds. We observe that Pt and the size of the jump in Tc between the two
superconducting phases both scale with the lanthanide element in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln
= La, Ce, Pr, Nd).

Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors

1. Introduction
The recent discovery of the BiS2-based superconductor Bi4O4S3 by Mizuguchi et al. [1, 2]
with a superconducting critical temperature T onset
c
of 8.6 K has generated much interest
in a new family of BiS2-based superconductors. The members of the class of novel BiS2-
based superconductors have layered crystal structures that consist of superconducting
BiS2 layers separated by blocking layers which act as charge reservoirs that dope the
BiS2 layers with charge carriers.[1] Experimental eﬀorts on the BiS2-based materials
have focused on increasing the charge carrier concentration via chemical substitution
within the blocking layer [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] as well as through a reduction of
the unit cell volume via the application of an external pressure.[13, 14, 15, 16]
Recent studies of the BiS2-based compounds involving chemical substitution
within the blocking layers have lead to the discovery of the related superconductors
LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb).[4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15] The compound
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, synthesized under high pressure, has been reported by Mizuguchi et
al. to have a Tc of 10.6 K which exceeds that of Bi4O4S3.[9] In addition, the compounds
with Ln = Ce, Pr, Nd, and Yb exhibit T onset
c
values of ∼3.0 , 5.6 , 4.3 , and 5.3 K,
respectively.[4, 8, 10, 11] More recent work demonstrates that chemical substitution of
the tetravalent ions Th+4, Hf+4, Zr+4 and Ti+4 for trivalent La+3 in LaOBiS2 increases
the charge-carrier density and induces superconductivity.[12]
Measurements of the pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ and the
superconducting critical temperature Tc have also recently been reported for several
of these new compounds.[13, 14, 15, 16] In this paper, we report the temperature
dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ from 3 to 300 K for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
(Ln = Pr, Nd) compounds under applied quasi-hydrostatic pressure up to ∼2.8 GPa.
Both compounds exhibit the same qualitative evolution of Tc in which they undergo
a pressure-induced transition at Pt from a low Tc superconducting phase to a high Tc
superconducting phase. This transition region is characterized by a rapid increase of Tc
in a narrow range of pressure ∼0.3 GPa. In the high Tc phase at ∼2.5 GPa, we observed
a maximum Tc of 7.6 K for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and 6.4 K for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2. In the normal
state of both materials, there is a signiﬁcant suppression of semiconducting behaviour
with pressure which is continuous up to the pressure Pt. A rapid increase of the charge
carrier density is inferred from both the suppression of the semiconducting behaviour
and the rapid increase of Tc in this region.[17]
The pressure dependence of ρ and the evolution of Tc reported in this article for
the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) compounds are qualitatively similar to the behaviour
we recently reported for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce) compounds.[14] For the
four BiS2-based layered superconductors, LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), the
transition pressure Pt and the size of the “jump” in Tc between the two superconducting
phases both scale with the lanthanide element Ln; speciﬁcally, as the atomic number of
Ln increases, Pt increases while the “jump” in Tc decreases.

2. Experimental section
Polycrystalline samples of LnO1−xFxBiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) with x = 0.5 were prepared by
solid-state reaction using powders of Pr2O3 (99.9%), PrF3 (99.9%), Pr2S3 (99.9%), and
Bi2S3 (99.9%) for PrO1−xFxBiS2, and powders of Nd2O3 (99.9%), NdF3 (99.9%), Nd2S3
(99.9%), and Bi2S3 (99.9%) for NdO1−xFxBiS2. Bi2S3 precursor powder was prepared in
an evacuated quartz tube by reacting Bi (99.99%) and S (99.9%) at 500◦C for 10 hours.
The Ln2S3 (Ln = Pr, Nd) precursor powders were prepared in an evacuated quartz tube
by reacting chunks of Pr and Nd with S grains at 800◦C for 10 hours. The starting mate-
rials with nominal composition LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) were weighed, thoroughly
mixed, pressed into pellets, sealed in evacuated quartz tubes, and annealed at 800◦C for
48 hours. The products were ground, mixed for homogenization, pressed into pellets,
and annealed again in evacuated quartz tubes at 800◦C for 48 hours. This last step was
repeated again to promote phase homogeneity. X-ray powder diﬀraction measurements
(not shown) were made using an X-ray diﬀractometer with a Cu Kα source to assess
phase purity and to determine the lattice parameters of the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr,
Nd) compounds. The main diﬀraction peaks for the two samples can be well indexed to
a tetragonal structure with space group P4/nmm conforming to the CeOBiS2 structure.
The lattice parameters for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 were determined to be a = b = 4.0192 ˚A and
c = 13.4238 ˚A, while for NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 the lattice parameters are a = b = 4.0102 ˚A
and c = 13.4468 ˚A.[11]
Measurements of ρ(T) under applied pressure were performed up to ∼2.8 GPa in
a clamped piston cylinder pressure cell between ∼3 K and 300 K in a pumped 4He
dewar. A 1:1 by volume mixture of n-pentane and isoamyl alcohol was used to provide
a quasi-hydrostatic pressure transmitting medium. Annealed Pt leads were aﬃxed to
gold-sputtered contact surfaces on each sample with silver epoxy in a standard four-
wire conﬁguration. The pressure dependence of Tc for high purity Sn (99.999%) was
measured inductively and used as a manometer for the experiments. The pressure was
determined by calibrating our Tc data for Sn against data used in [18]. The width of
the superconducting transition of the Sn manometer was used as a measure of the error
in pressure, which was found to be on the order ∆P ∼± 0.05 GPa.
3. Results
Plots of the temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity ρ below 300 K for
PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 at various pressures up to 2.8 GPa are shown in Fig-
ure 1 (a) and (b), respectively. Both compounds exhibit semiconducting behaviour at
low pressure (indicated by a negative temperature coeﬃcient of resistivity (dρ/dT < 0)).
The semiconducting behaviour is strongly suppressed at lower pressures. As pressure
is increased, the electrical resistivity ρ of PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 becomes weakly temperature
dependent above ∼1.5 GPa, but remains semiconducting (dρ/dT < 0). In contrast, the

similar behaviour in the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound. Sharp superconducting transitions
near 4.0 K were observed at low pressures up to ∼1.5 GPa. The width ∆Tc of the
superconducting transition then appears to broaden near ∼1.8 GPa. In the small range
∼1.8 - 2.1 GPa, there is a sizable increase in Tc from ∼3.9 to 6.3 K. In NdO0.5F0.5BiS2,
Tc passes through a maximum of 6.4 K at ∼2.5 GPa and then gradually decreases at
higher pressures up to ∼2.8 GPa, similar to the behaviour observed for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2.

The temperature-pressure phase diagrams for the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2
compounds are displayed in Figure 2(a) and (b), respectively. In the superconducting
state, both compounds exhibit a low Tc phase which is characterized by a gradual in-
crease in Tc with pressure. In the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, Tc increases monotonically
from 3.5 to 3.9 K at pressures up to ∼1.5 GPa (dTc/dP = 0.40 K GPa−1). In the
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample, there was a non-monotonic decrease in Tc from 4.1 to 3.9 K at
pressures up to ∼1.8 GPa. As pressure is increased, both compounds exhibit a rapid
increase in Tc within a narrow range ∼0.3 GPa. For the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, Tc
increases dramatically from 3.9 to 7.4 K as pressure is increased from ∼1.5 to 1.8 GPa
(dTc/dP = 11.7 K GPa−1). In the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, there is a signiﬁcant
jump in Tc from 3.9 to 6.3 K as pressure is increased from ∼1.8 to 2.1 GPa (dTc/dP =
8.0 K GPa−1). Following the rapid increase in Tc, both compounds exhibit a high Tc
superconducting phase, in which the evolution of Tc exhibits a domelike behaviour; i.e.,
Tc gradually increases to its maximum value and then slowly decreases with pressure.
In the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, Tc increases to a maximum value of 7.6 K at 2.5 GPa
and then steadily decreases with pressure, while in the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, Tc
increases to a maximum Tc of 6.4 K at ∼2.5 GPa and then decreases slowly with pres-
sure.
In the normal state (above the Tc(P) curves shown in Figure 2), the semiconducting
behaviour in both compounds is continuously suppressed with pressure as manifested
by the decrease of the energy gap ∆1 (deﬁned below) with pressure, the values of which
are indicated in the false colour legend of Figure 2(a) and (b) for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, respectively. The NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 sample exhibits a fully metallic state
at ∼2 GPa (where ∆1 vanishes), represented by the green region to the right of the
crosshatching in Figure 2(b).
From the plot of log(ρ) vs. P displayed in Figure 3(a), there is a noticeable change
in the magnitude of the suppression rate, dlog(ρ)/dP, for both the PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and
NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. The ρ(P) data for PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 were
taken in the normal state at 8.5 K and 7.5 K, respectively. These temperatures occur
just above the onset of the superconducting transition at T onset
c
. In both compounds,
there is a strong suppression of electrical resistivity up to ∼2.1 GPa, followed by a
weaker suppression at higher pressures. The dotted lines in Figure 3(a) are guides to
the eye for the rates of suppression. The change in the suppression rate near 2.1 GPa
(emphasized by the vertical arrows in Figure 3(a)) is coincident with Pt.
The semiconducting behaviour of the ρ(T) data and its rapid suppression with
pressure was noted by Kotegawa et al. in their study of the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound
synthesized under high pressure.[13] They observed that ρ(T) could be described over
two distinct temperature regions by the relation ρ(T) = ρ0e∆/2kBT where ρ0 is a con-
stant and ∆is an energy gap. In a recent paper, we applied this analysis to extract the
high and low temperature energy gaps ∆1 and ∆2 for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La,
Ce) compounds.[14] We used the same analysis in the current study to determine the
value of the high temperature energy gap ∆1 for both compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln

= Pr, Nd). The energy gap ∆1 in NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 was determined using the ρ(T) data
from the region 100 - 200 K for lower pressures 0.37 - 0.69 GPa and ρ(T) data from the
region 20 - 100 K for higher pressures 1.47 - 2.80 GPa. For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, the energy
gap ∆1 was extracted using ρ(T) data in the region 200 - 280 K for all pressures up to
2.80 GPa.
The pressure dependence of the energy gap ∆1 for both compounds is shown in Fig-
ure 3(b). The energy gap ∆1 decreases rapidly with pressure up to ∼2 GPa. Above ∼2
GPa, ∆1 exhibits relatively little pressure dependence. This is consistent with the tran-
sition to a weaker suppression rate shown in Figure 3(a) which also sets in at ∼2 GPa.


Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors

In NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, the energy gap ∆1/kB = 0 K above 1.8 GPa. This is consistent with
the semiconductor-metal transition near 2 GPa indicated by a positive temperature co-
eﬃcient of electrical resistivity (dρ/dT > 0) seen in the ρ(T) data shown in Figure 1(b).
The rapid decrease in the energy gap ∆1 for P < Pt in both the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln =
Pr, Nd) compounds is similar to behaviour observed previously in the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
(Ln = La, Ce) compounds.[13, 14]

of Tc under applied pressure for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) samples reported
in section 3 of this paper are markedly similar to the results we recently reported for
the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce) compounds.[14] As shown in the phase diagrams
displayed in Figure 4(a), each of the four compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce,
Pr, Nd) exhibits an abrupt pressure-induced transition from a low Tc superconducting
phase at lower pressure to a high Tc superconducting phase at higher pressure.
In the four compounds, the pressure-induced transition observed in the supercon-
ducting state is coincident with changes in the suppression of the electrical resistivity ρ
in the normal state. The rate of suppression of semiconducting behaviour (Figure 3(a))
and the rate of decrease in the energy gap ∆1 (Figure 3(b)) both saturate at pressures
that correlate with the transition pressure into the high Tc superconducting phase. In
the speciﬁc case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, a semiconductor-metal transition oc-
curs at Pt. These changes in the normal state electrical resistivity indicate there may
be signiﬁcant increases in the charge carrier density during the rapid increase in Tc that
occurs between the two superconducting phases.[17]
The transition pressures Pt, indicated by the black arrows in the temperature-
pressure phase diagrams of Figure 4(a), were deﬁned as the pressure corresponding to
the value of Tc at the midpoint between the values of Tc in the low and high Tc phases
immediately preceding and following the transition. Pt is plotted as a function of lan-
thanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 in Figure 4(b). There is a
clear linear relationship between the increasing atomic number of Ln and an increase in
Pt. The magnitude of the “jump” in Tc also scales with the atomic number of the Ln
element in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 as clearly shown in the inset of Figure 4(b). The pressure-
induced increase in Tc decreases in magnitude as the atomic number of the lanthanide
element increases. The lengths of the vertical bars in Figure 4(b) represent the respec-
tive pressure windows over which the transitions from the low Tc phase to the high
Tc phase occurred in each of the four compounds. The pressure range over which the
transition occurs also decreases with increasing atomic number of Ln in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2.
Table 1 contains values of low Tc, maximum Tc, overall increase in Tc (max. Tc - low
Tc), and transition pressure Pt, for each compound.
The evolution of Tc with pressure in the low Tc phase has recently been reported
for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) compounds in two studies by Selvan et al.[15, 16]

For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, they observed a gradual increase of Tc from 3.7 to 4.7 K with pres-
sure up to ∼2.2 GPa.[16] For NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, they found a gradual evolution of Tc with
pressure from 4.6 to 5.0 K up to a pressure of ∼1.3 GPa and then down from 5.0 to 4.8
K upon further application of pressure up to ∼1.8 GPa.[15] In both reports, however,
there was no evidence of a transition characterized by a rapid increase in Tc. It is pos-
sible that slight variations in the chemical composition of the samples in their studies
compared to those studied by us may be responsible for diﬀerences in the material’s
response to applied pressure. Furthermore, the pressure transmitting media used in
this study (see section 2) and the transmitting ﬂuid used in their studies [15, 16] may
have diﬀerent properties with regard to pressure gradients that can aﬀect the measured
pressure at which a transition occurs.[19] It is also possible that the pressures reached
in their studies were lower than the pressure required to induce the transitions that we
observed in this report.
5. Concluding remarks
We have observed markedly similar behaviour in the temperature dependence of the nor-
mal state electrical resistivity and evolution of the superconducting critical temperature
Tc under applied pressure for the two BiS2-based superconductors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln
= Pr, Nd). The qualitative behaviour observed for the two compounds in this study is
strikingly similar to the results we recently reported for the two BiS2-based superconduc-
tors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce).[14] In each of the four compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2
(Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), there is a sizable enhancement of Tc in the superconducting state
accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behaviour with pressure in the normal
state. The suppression of the semiconducting behaviour in the normal state saturates
at a critical pressure Pt which corresponds to the pressure where there is a transition
between a low Tc superconducting phase and a high Tc superconducting phase. The
semiconducting behaviour of the electrical resistivity in the normal state is consistent
with an energy gap that is suppressed with pressure in a similar way. In the particular
case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, there is a pressure-induced semiconductor-metal
transition at Pt ≈2 GPa.
The coincidence of the saturation of the suppression of semiconducting behaviour
in the normal state electrical resistivity with the rapid increase in Tc indicates there
may be signiﬁcant increases in the charge carrier density in the vicinity of the pressure-
induced transition. We found that the transition pressure Pt (see section 4) increases
with increasing atomic number of the lanthanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in
LnO0.5F0.5BiS2. However, the size of the increase in Tc between the two superconduct-
ing phases decreases as lanthanide atomic number increases. The scaling of both the
transition pressure Pt and the size of the “jump” in Tc with the atomic number of the
lanthanide element suggests that the pressure-induced transition between the two su-
perconducting phases may be a structural transition; however, at present, the precise

mechanism driving the enhancement of Tc with pressure is unknown. X-ray diﬀraction
experiments under pressure on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound are currently underway to
help determine whether the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc and the suppression of
semiconducting behaviour are related to a structural transition.
