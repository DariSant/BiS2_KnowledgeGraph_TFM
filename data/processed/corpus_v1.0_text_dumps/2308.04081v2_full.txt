Recently, robustness of superconductivity (transition temperature, 
Tc) under high pressures has been observed in high-entropy alloy 
(HEA), bcc-type Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta, and HEA-type compounds 
(Ag,In,Sn,Pb,Bi)Te with a NaCl-type structure. Since those materials 
have three-dimensional crystal structure, investigation on the 
pressure dependence of Tc of low-dimensional materials is needed to 
understand 
the 
phenomena. 
Here, 
we 
investigated 
the 
superconducting properties and the crystal structure of BiS2-based 
layered system REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Although the robustness of Tc was 
induced in MTe with increasing M-site configurational entropy, the 
increase in RE-site configurational entropy does not induce 
robustness of Tc under high pressures in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The crystal 
structure of HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 was confirmed as monoclinic 
P21/m, which is the same space group as the zero-entropy counterpart 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The results suggest that an increase in configurational 
entropy at blocking layers do not affect crystal structure and 
superconducting properties under high pressures in the BiS2-based 
layered system. 
 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
 High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are multi-element alloys containing five or more elements with 
5–35% [1,2]. Because of high performance in various mechanical and functional properties, 
HEAs have been extensively studied in the field of materials science [3]. In 2014, 
superconductivity in a HEA, Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta, was reported [4]. After the discovery, many HEA 


2 
 
superconductors have been developed [5–12]. One of the noticeable features of HEA 
superconductors is their superconducting characteristics clearly different from low-entropy 
crystalline alloys and amorphous alloys [5]. Furthermore, robustness of superconductivity under 
high pressures was reported in Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta by Guo et al. where comparable superconducting 
transition temperatures (Tcs) were observed up to about 200 GPa [13]. Later, this Tc-pinning 
phenomenon of the HEA was explained by theoretical estimation of electronic density of states 
[14]. However, in the study, contribution of phonon on superconductivity pairing was not 
estimated.  
Recently, we studied pressure effects on superconductivity, crystal structure, and electronic 
states of NaCl-type metal telluride MTe family (M = Ag, In, Sn, Pb, Bi) with different 
configurational entropy of mixing (ΔSmix) [15,16]. In zero-entropy PbTe, two-step structural 
transitions from cubic (NaCl), orthorhombic, to cubic (CsCl) [Fig. 1(a)] is observed [17–19], but 
the orthorhombic phase was suppressed in medium- and high-entropy-alloy-type Ag1/3Pb1/3Bi1/3Te 
and Ag0.2In0.2Sn0.2Pb0.2Bi0.2Te5 [20]. Therefore, in the simple MTe structure, pressure dependence 
of crystal structure was modified by an increase in M-site ΔSmix. The noticeable feature in MTe is 
the observation of Tc-pinning states under high pressures at P = 15–35 GPa in a CsCl-type phase 
of HEA-type (Ag,In,Sn,Pb,Bi)Te, whereas PbTe exhibits a clear decrease in Tc in the CsCl-type 
phase. [20]. Further, simulations on atomic vibration in MTe suggested the emergence of glassy 
vibrational density of states by an increase in M-site ΔSmix [21]. X-ray absorption spectroscopy 
[20] and electronic band calculations suggested that electronic density of state in MTe with all 
zero-, medium-, and high-entropy-alloy compositions show similar decrease with increasing 
pressure. Therefore, the current scenario of the Tc-pinning states in MTe is the explanation with 
the glassy phonon and unique electron-phonon coupling in HEA-type MTe caused by introduced 
huge M-site disorders [21].

  To reach a solid conclusion on the mechanisms of the Tc-pinning phenomenon in HE-type 
materials, further examples with/without Tc-pinning sates in the pressure dependence of Tc. In this 
study, we focus on BiS2-based layered superconductors REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm) 
[Fig. 1(b)] because a previous study revealed that the increase in RE-site ΔSmix results in the 
suppression of local disorder at the in-plane S site; the positive correlation between the 
suppression of in-plane disorder and the emergence of bulk superconductivity is an established 
trend in the system [22–25]. The suppression of structural disorder in the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system 
by an increase in RE-site ΔSmix is a trend contrasting to the case of MTe with a variable M-site 
ΔSmix. Therefore, the difference in the evolution of structural disorder by tuning ΔSmix should 
depend on crystal structures. Furthermore, in BiS2-based system, the electronic states near the 
Fermi energy are dominated by Bi-6p electrons in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 [22], which simply implies that 
the electronic states of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 are not affected by an increase in RE-site ΔSmix. Therefore, 
to link the Tc-pinning phenomenon and glassy atomic vibrations caused by site disorder, for 
example in MTe, the confirmation of the absence of Tc-pinning states in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 
is important. That should be useful to further investigate the physical properties of HEA-type 
layered superconductors [26–29]. Here, we show that the increase in RE-site ΔSmix in 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 does not affect the pressure-induced tetragonal-monoclinic structural transition, 
and the pressure dependences of Tc for all the examined REO0.5F0.5BiS2 exhibit clear decrease 
with pressure.

Experimental Details 
Polycrystalline samples of REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, 
La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2 were prepared by solid-state reaction as described in Ref. 23. According 
to the RE-site composition, ΔSmix for the above four compositions is calculated as 0, 0.69R, 1.1R, 
and 1.6R, respectively.  
The high-pressure synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HP-SXRD) was performed at BL10XU of 
SPring-8 under the proposal (No.: 2022A1086). The powder sample was loaded into a sample 
hole drilled in a SUS gasket together with a pressure medium, He gas, using 200 MPa gas loading 
system at SPring-8. The samples were compressed to the pressures of interest using single crystal 
diamond anvils. The actual pressure generated in the cell was determined by wavelength shift of 
the ruby R1 fluorescence line [30]. An imaging plate detector Rigaku R-AXIS IV++ was used to 
collect SXRD patterns where the exposure time was 80 s, and the DAC was oscillated during the 
experiments. IP Analyzer [31] was used to obtain one-dimensional data from two-dimensional 
original data. The wave length of X-ray was 0.412868 Å. The obtained HP-SXRD patterns were 


4 
 
refined by the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP [32]. Schematic images of the crystal structures 
were depicted using VESTA [33]. 
Electrical resistance measurements were performed at ambient pressure and high pressures 
using a standard four-probe method on a Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS, 
Quantum Design). A diamond anvil cell (DAC) with boron-doped diamond electrodes was used 
for the high-pressure measurements [34,35]. We used cBN for a pressure medium. The applied 
pressure was estimated from the relationship between the pressure and wavelength of the ruby 
fluorescence [36] measured by an inVia Raman Microscope (RENISHAW).

Figure 2(a) shows the HP-SXDR patterns for La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2. The HP-
SXRD patterns for P = 0.5 and 0.9 GPa could be refined with a tetragonal (P4/nmm) moder as 
shown in Fig. 2(c) with a minor impurity phase of REF3. At P ≥ 1.8 GPa, clear peak broadenings

were seen, which corresponds to the structural transition to monoclinic (P21/m). The typical 
Rietveld refinement result for the high-P phase is shown in Fig. 2(d). Although the fitting is not 
good due to broadened peaks under high pressure, which has been also seen in a previous work 
on LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [37], the peak positions are well explained by the monoclinic model. Therefore, 
the HEA-type La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 also exhibits a pressure-induced structural 
transition from tetragonal to monoclinic, which is same as zero-entropy counter-part 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [37]. In MTe, the lower-symmetry (orthorhombic) phase was suppressed by an 
increase in M-site ΔSmix, but, in the case of REO0.5F0.5BiS2, the increase in RE-site ΔSmix less 
affects the crystal-structure phase diagram under high pressures [37]. The obtained lattice 
parameters are summarized in Fig. 3. Lattice parameters a and b clearly split after the structural 
transition. The obtained β is close to that reported for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high pressures [37].

4.  Superconducting properties 
  We have investigated the pressure dependence of Tc for REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with difference RE-site 
ΔSmix to examine whether the Tc-pinning phenomena occur in the layered BiS2-based crystal 
structure by measuring electrical resistance (R) under high pressure using DAC. Figures 4(a–d) 
show the R-T plots for RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2, 
respectively. For all samples, R systematically decreases with increasing pressure, which is consistent 
with pressure studies [37–39]. The residual resistance observed below the superconducting transition 
is due to connectivity between the sample and DAC electrodes. In such a case, in DAC experiments, 
we evaluate pressure evolution of superconductivity using onset of the superconducting transition. 
Here, Tc (onset) was defined as a temperature where the R deviates from a linear T dependence just 
above the superconducting transition [Fig. 4(e)]. This criterion was utilized in this study because the 
sharpness of the transitions varied with pressure and compositions. We tested other methods for 
estimation of Tc, such as those based on the anomaly in T derivative plot and crossing points of two 
linear fitting lines below and above Tc, but those attempts failed to compare Tcs in the set of R-T data.

R. Jha et al. [40] has been added for comparison.

  Figure 4(f) shows the P dependences of Tc for RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and 
La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2. For RE = Pr, low-pressure Tcs [40] are plotted together with high-pressure 
data to overview the Tc-P trend. In REO0.5F0.5BiS2, Tc increases with increasing pressure in the 
tetragonal structure [37,40], and Tc decreases in the monoclinic structure. This trend is observed in all 
the measured samples with RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2. Here, 
we do not find any effects of the change in ΔSmix on the Tc-P trends, with which we conclude that the 
Tc-pinning phenomenon is absent in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
 
5.  Discussion and conclusion 
  Here, we discuss the reason for the absence of Tc-pinning phenomenon in HEA-type 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 with a layered crystal structure. According to a previous study on isotope effect on Tc 
[41], phonon-mediated superconductivity is expected in the monoclinic (high-pressure) phases of 
RE(O,F)BiS2. If modification of phonon characteristics is induced due to the presence of the HEA-
type RE site, superconducting properties of RE(O,F)BiS2 should be largely affected. In Ref. 25, we 
reported that the increase in RE-site ΔSmix suppresses in-plane S-site disorder (in-plane displacement 
parameter U11) in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. In such situation, atomic vibration characteristics of the BiS2 
conducting layers should not be modified, and glassy atomic vibration, which was observed in HEA-
type MTe [21], could not be induced in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As shown in Fig. 1, the crystal 
structures are clearly different between MTe (simple three-dimensional NaCl-type structure) and 
REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (two-dimensional layered structure). Furthermore, the affections of the disorder at the 
HEA-type site to electronic and vibrational properties would be depending on the position of the HEA-
type site. The pressure studies on MTe and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the incorporation of HEA-
type sites is not enough to induce Tc-pinning phenomena, and glassy characteristics of atomic vibration 
would be the direct cause of the Tc-pinning phenomena in HEA-type superconductors. 
  In conclusion, we have studied the crystal structure evolution of HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 
under high pressures and confirmed that the HEA-type sample also exhibits a tetragonal-
monoclinic transition at a pressure range similar to that for zero-entropy LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Therefore, 
the increase in RE-site ΔSmix does not affect pressure-structure phase diagram in REO0.5F0.5BiS2. 
To investigate whether Tc-pinning phenomena occur in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2 under high 
pressures, we measured P dependence of Tc by collecting R-T data for RE = Pr, Ce0.5Nd0.5, 
Ce1/3Pr1/3Nd1/3, and La0.2Ce0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2. All samples exhibited clear decreases in Tc with 
increasing pressure in the monoclinic phase, which indicates the absence of Tc-pinning 
phenomena in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The obtained results are consistent with the scenario that 
Tc-pinning phenomena occur when glassy atomic vibrations are induced by introduction of HEA-
type sites in HEA-type superconductors.
