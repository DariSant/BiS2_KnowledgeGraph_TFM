Novel BiS2-based superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2 prepared by the 
high pressure synthesis technique were systematically studied. It 
was found that the high pressure annealing strongly the lattice as 
compared to the LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples prepared by conventional 
solid state reaction at ambient pressure. Bulk superconductivity was 
observed within a wide F-concentration range of x = 0.2 ~ 0.7. On 
the basis of those results, we have established a phase diagram of 
LaO1-xFxBiS2.

1.  Introduction 
 Recently, several BiS2-based superconductors, commonly having the Bi-S square lattice 
planes, have been discovered.1-15) Due to the layered crystal structure and some exotic 
physical properties similar to cuprate16-19) and Fe-based superconductors,20-31) the BiS2-based 
compounds are expected to provide us with the next stage to explore new superconductors 
and discuss the exotic superconductivity mechanisms. The Bi4O4S3 superconductor exhibits 
metallic transport behavior and show a zero-resistivity state below 4.5 K.1) The crystal 
structure is composed of a stacking of the Bi4O4(SO4) blocking layers and the Bi2S4 
superconducting layers (two BiS2 layers). Thus, the parent phase is Bi6O8S5 and it is expected 
to be insulator on the basis of the band calculations. The Bi4O4S3 phase has partial defects at 
the SO4 site, which provide electron carriers into the BiS2 superconducting layers. Another 
BiS2-based system is ReO1-xFxBiS2 (Re = Rare earth). So far, LaO1-xFxBiS2, CeO1-xFxBiS2, 
PrO1-xFxBiS2 and NdO1-xFxBiS2 were found to be superconducting with transition 
temperatures (Tc) of 10.62), 3.014), 5.515), 5.6 K11), respectively. In both systems, optimal 


 
superconducting properties are obtained near the boundary between insulating and 
superconducting states. In fact, the electronic-specific-heat coefficient of the Bi4O4S3 
superconducting sample was found to be very small.32) This respect resembles to the layered 
nitride family.33,34) By theoretical studies, possible paring mechanisms relating to 
charge-density-wave instability and nature of strong coupling were predicted.9) Although the 
superconductivity mechanisms of the BiS2-based family are unclear, we can expect a higher 
Tc in this system, because of some exotic physical and structural properties. In fact, an 
enhancement of Tc under high pressure was observed in LaO1-xFxBiS2 system.35) Therefore, 
systematic studies of both structural and superconducting properties are important. In this 
article we report systematic studies on LaO1-xFxBiS2 superconductors prepared using a high 
pressure synthesis technique. 
 
 
2. Experimental details 
The polycrystalline samples of LaO1-xFxBiS2 were prepared by two-step process of the solid 
state reaction and the high pressure annealing using a Cubic-Anvil-type high pressure 
synthesis machine with a 180 ton press. The starting materials of Bi2O3 (98 % powder), BiF3 
(99.9 % powder), La2S3 (99.9 % powder), Bi (99.9 % grains) were used in this study. The 
Bi2S3 powder was prepared using Bi grains and S (99.9999 %) grains. The starting powders 
with a nominal ratio of LaO1-xFxBiS2 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.7 were well-mixed and pressed into 
pellets. The pellets were sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 700 ºC for 10 h. 
The obtained pellets were ground and annealed at 600 ºC for 1 h under a hydrostatic pressure 
of 2 GPa. The obtained samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction with Cu-Kα radiation 
using the 2θ-θ method. Lattice parameters were calculated using the least-square calculations. 
The electrical resistivity was measured using the four-terminal method from 300 to 2 K. The 
magnetic susceptibility measurements were performed using a superconducting quantum 
interference device SQUID magnetometer from 15 to 2 K. The magnetic susceptibility 
measurements were performed after both zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) 
with an applied field of 10 Oe. In this article, we classify synthesis methods “HP” and “AP”, 
which stand for high-pressure-annealed and ambient-pressure annealed samples, respectively. 
 
3.  Results and discussion 
3.1 Crystal structure 


 
Figure 1 shows the powder x-ray diffraction patterns for x = 0 ~ 0.7 (HP). Almost all of the 
peaks are indexed using the space group of P4/nmm. For lower x, the pattern and peak 
sharpness seem to be relevant to those of AP samples. With increasing x, however, the peaks 
become broader. To compare the peak shifts, we plotted the enlarged patterns near the (102) 
and (004) peaks for x = 0 (HP), 0.2 (HP) and 0.5 (HP) with those for x = 0 (AP), 0.2 (AP) and 
0.5 (AP) in Fig. 2. For both the AP and HP samples, clear peak shifts corresponding to lattice 
shrinkage with increasing F concentration. Interestingly, we note an obvious deference in 
between the powder patterns for x = 0 (AP) and 0 (HP). The (102) peak position of x = 0 (HP) 
is clearly higher than that of x = 0.5 (AP), while the (004) peak position seems to show a 
slight shift. These facts indicate that the high-pressure annealing can shrink the ab plane as 
compared to the AP synthesis. The calculated lattice constants a, c and volume (V) are plotted 
as a function of x in Figs. 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c), respectively. In Fig. 3(a), it is found that the a 
parameters of HP samples are smaller than those of AP samples. The x dependence of a 
parameter exhibits a dome-shaped dependence for the HP samples. In contrast, the c axis and 
lattice volume shows a continuous decrease with increasing x. 
 
3.2 Superconducting properties 
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 down to 2 K for 
LaO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0 ~ 0.7. For x = 0, a semiconducting-like behavior is observed and 
superconducting transition is not detected above 2 K. An enlargement of low temperatures 
below 15 K is shown in Fig. 4(b). With F doping, the semiconducting-like behavior is slightly 
suppressed and superconductivity appears in x = 0.2. With further F-doping, the 
semiconducting-like behavior is enhanced again. However, the Tc is enhanced and exceeds 10 
K (onset) at x = 0.5. Then, superconductivity is gradually suppressed for x > 0.5 and 
disappears at x = 0.7. Correspondingly to the resistivity measurements, the evolution of bulk 
superconductivity is also confirmed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Figure 5(a) 
shows the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility below 12 K for LaO1-xFxBiS2 
with x = 0 ~ 0.7. With increasing x, the Tc and the diamagnetic signals are strongly enhanced, 
and the optimal superconducting properties are obtained at x = 0.5. With further F doping, 
bulk superconductivity is suppressed. Figure 5(b) displays an enlargement of Fig. 5(a) near 
the superconducting transition. We defined Tc
mag as an onset temperature and Tc
irr as the 
starting temperature of bifurcation between χZFC and χFC. The Tc
irr almost corresponds to the 
zero-resistivity temperature (Tc
zero) where the superconducting current appears. Both Tc
mag and 
Tc
irr show the highest at x = 0.5, which is consistent with the resistivity measurements. 


 
On the basis of the obtained results, we established a phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiS2 
prepared using high-pressure annealing at 600 ºC under 2 GPa. Figure 6 shows the 
established phase diagram with the determined Tc
onset, Tc
zero, Tc
mag and Tc
irr. The optimal 
superconducting properties are obtained at the summit of the dome. The dome structure 
resembles the curvature of the a lattice constant as shown in Fig. 3(a). This fact implies that 
the Tc of LaO1-xFxBiS2 correlates with the a axis. In fact, the maximum Tc observed in several 
BiS2-based superconductors depends on blocking layer structure. When we focus only bulk 
BiS2-based superconductors, namely Bi4O4S3, NdO1-xFxBiS2, PrO1-xFxBiS2 and LaO1-xFxBiS2, 
we note the tendency that higher Tc appears with larger a axis. 1,2,11,15) Furthermore, Xing et al. 
indicated that the BiS2-based superconductivity is realized near the vicinity of insulating 
phase.14) A larger a value may enhance insulating nature and simultaneously realize higher-Tc 
superconductivity in this family. With this respect, exploration for new BiS2-based 
superconductors with larger blocking layers will be important. To achieve that, the high 
pressure technique will be a great skill. 
 
 
4. Conclusion 
We have synthesized novel BiS2-based superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0 ~ 0.7 
using solid-state reaction and high-pressure post annealing. As compared to the LaO1-xFxBiS2 
samples prepared using only solid-state reaction, the lattice constants of the high-pressure 
samples were smaller. Superconducting transition was observed for x = 0.2 ~ 0.7, and the 
optimal superconducting properties were obtained for x = 0.5 with the Tc
onset exceeding 10 K. 
The phase diagram showed an x-dependent superconducting dome. The evolution of 
dome-shaped dependence resembled the x dependence of the a axis. This may indicate that 
the correlation between the Tc and the a axis is essential for BiS2-based superconductivity.
