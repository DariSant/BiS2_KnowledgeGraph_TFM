Abstract 
The high anisotropy in RO1-aFaBiS2 (R denotes a rare-earth element) superconductors 
demonstrates their potential use as intrinsic Josephson junctions, considering the weak 
coupling among BiS2-PrO(F)-BiS2 (superconducting-normal-superconducting) layers 
along the c-axis. We grew PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals using CsCl/KCl flux. The 
superconducting anisotropies of the grown single crystals were estimated to be 
approximately 40–50 from the effective mass model. The c-axis transport properties 


 
2
were characterized using single-crystal s-shaped intrinsic Josephson junctions with a 
focused ion beam. Along the c-axis, the crystals showed zero resistivity at 2.7 K and a 
critical current density of 1.33×103 A/cm2 at 2.0 K. The current–voltage curve along the 
c-axis displayed hysteresis. The c-axis transport measurements under a magnetic field 
parallel to the ab-plane revealed a “lock-in” state due to the Josephson vortex flow, 
indicating that BiS2 superconductors are promising candidates for intrinsic Josephson 
junctions.

1. Introduction 
The newly developed BiS2-based layered superconductors Bi4O4S3
1,2) and RO1-aFaBiS2 
(R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, or Yb)3-12) have attracted much interest. Superconductivity is 
induced by carrier doping through the substitution of F at the O site in ROBiS2. 
Recently, we have reported on the growth of RO1-aFaBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Nd) single 
crystals by using the CsCl/KCl flux method. Their structures and transport properties 
along the ab-plane were examined.13-17) The superconducting anisotropies of 
RO1-aFaBiS2 (R = La, Nd) single crystals have been estimated to be as high as 30 using 
an effective mass model,13-15) which demonstrates their potential use as intrinsic 
Josephson junctions along the c-axis.18,19) Intrinsic Josephson junctions were discovered 
in high-Tc cuprate superconductors. Such junctions emerged in the crystal structures of 
layered superconductors. Consequently, devices based on self-assembled nano junctions 
have been achieved. The applications of intrinsic Josephson junctions include terahertz 
radiation sources20) and quantum bits.21,22) However, there have been no previous 
experimental reports on intrinsic Josephson junctions along the c-axis of BiS2-based 
layered superconductors. Thus, their c-axis transport properties have attracted much 


 
4
attention. Additionally, single crystals of RO1-aFaBiS2 (R = Pr) have not yet been 
studied.  
In this investigation, we grew PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals with different F 
concentrations using CsCl/KCl flux and examined their transport properties parallel and 
perpendicular to the c-axis. Furthermore, we evaluated the s-shaped junctions23,24) along 
the c-axis of a PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystal.  
 
2. Experimental procedure 
Single crystals of PrO1-aFaBiS2 were grown using CsCl/KCl flux.13,15) The raw materials 
of Pr2S3, Bi, Bi2S3, Bi2O3, and BiF3 were weighed with a nominal composition of 
PrO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0–0.9). The molar ratio of the flux was CsCl:KCl = 5:3. 0.8 g of 
weighed raw materials and 5.0 g of CsCl/KCl flux were mixed in a mortar and sealed in 
a quartz tube in vacuum. The mixed powder was heated at 800 °C for 10 h, cooled 
slowly to 600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, and then furnace-cooled to room temperature. The 
quartz tube was opened in air atmosphere, and the flux was dissolved in distilled water 
in the quartz tube. The products were filtered and washed with distilled water. The 
structures and compositions of the grown single crystals were evaluated by X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) analysis using CuKα radiation, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 


 
5
and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The critical temperatures (Tc) of the grown 
single crystals were estimated from the magnetization–temperature (M–T) curve under 
zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) using a superconducting quantum 
interface device (SQUID) with an applied magnetic field of 10 Oe parallel to the c-axis. 
The resistivity-temperature (ρ-T) and current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the single 
crystals were measured by the standard four-probe method in the constant current (J) 
mode using a physical property measurement system (PPMS DynaCool; Quantum 
Design). The electrical terminals were made of silver paste. We measured the angular 
(θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) in the flux liquid state under various magnetic fields 
(H) and calculated superconducting anisotropy (γs) using the effective mass model.25-27) 
For the c-axis transport measurement, we fabricated s-shaped junctions from a grown 
single crystal fixed on the SrTiO3 single-crystal substrate by a three-dimensional (3D) 
focused ion beam (FIB) etching method using a Ga-ion beam.23,24) The area of the 
junctions was about 5.4 × 5.7 μm2 in the ab-plane. The thickness of the junctions was 
about 1.0 μm along the c-axis. Normal-state anisotropy (γn) was estimated from the ρ-T 
characteristics of the as-grown (J//ab-plane) and fabricated (J//c-axis) samples. The 
sample-position (the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field) dependence of 
the flow voltage (Vff) of the fabricated sample was measured under a magnetic field.

3. Results and discussion 
Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of a PrO1-aFaBiS2 plate like single crystal, which is 
around 1–3 mm in size and 20–40 μm thick. The well-developed plane was determined 
to be the ab-plane by XRD measurement. Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of a 
well-developed plane in a single crystal grown from a starting powder with a nominal 
composition of PrO0.7F0.3BiS2. The peak positions are in agreement with those of the 
(00l) diffraction peaks of PrO1-aFaBiS2 described in the literature.6) The presence of only 
(00l) diffraction peaks of the PrO1-aFaBiS2 structure indicates a well-developed 
ab-plane.  
Figure 3 shows the M–T curve for single crystals grown from a starting powder 
with a nominal composition of PrO0.7F0.3BiS2 under ZFC and FC. The Meissner effect 
was confirmed from the magnetization between 2 and 10 K. Tc was defined in the 
separation temperature of FC and ZFC curves. The Tc and superconducting volume 
fraction at 2.0 K were estimated to be 3.8 K and 75%, respectively.  
Table I shows the F concentrations of the starting materials, c-axis lattice 
parameters, and Tc and γs values of the single crystals. The F concentrations in the 
starting materials and grown crystals are defined as x and y, respectively. Single crystals 


 
7
were obtained from the starting materials of 0.1 ≤ x ≤ 0.8, but only a small amount of 
grown single crystals was obtained for x = 0.1. The chemical ratio of Pr:Bi:S in the 
single crystals was determined to be 1.06 ± 0.02:1.02 ± 0.03:2 by EPMA, and the sulfur 
concentration was normalized to be 2. The composition of the grown crystals was 
almost stoichiometric, with a slightly Pr-rich composition. Cs, K, and Cl were not 
detected in the crystals by EPMA with a minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 wt%. The 
value of y in the grown crystals increased to up to 0.26 with increasing x to up to 0.5, 
and it almost saturated at x ≥ 0.5. The c-axis lattice parameters of the single crystals (x > 
0.2) were close to those of polycrystalline samples.28) The c-axis lattice parameters of 
the grown crystals decreased with increasing x, and they almost saturated at x ≥ 0.4. 
These results suggest that the solubility limit of F in PrOBiS2 crystals is between 0.4 
and 0.5, as shown in Fig. 4. The values of y and the c-axis lattice parameters are almost 
the same between x = 0.5 and 0.8. However, the Tcs show deviations of 4.1–4.6 K. We 
assume that the experimental error caused the deviations of Tc values. Slight changes in 
the F concentration and/or local structure might affect the transition temperature.17) The 
grown single crystals, except those at x = 0.1, showed superconducting transitions, and 
the F concentration in the PrO1-aFaBiS2 grown crystals increased Tc to up to around 4.5 
K.

The θ dependence of ρ was measured at different H values in the flux liquid state 
to estimate the γs values of PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals in accordance with the 
experimental procedure in Refs. 25 and 26. The reduced field (Hred) was calculated 
using the following equation for an effective mass model:  
Hred = H(sin2θ+γs
-2cos2θ)1/2,                  (1) 
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field,27) and Hred is 
calculated from H and θ. γs was estimated from the best scaling of the ρ–Hred 
relationship. Figure 5 shows the θ dependence of ρ in the grown crystal of y = 0.18 
under different magnetic fields (H = 0.1–9.0 T) in the flux liquid state at 3.0 K. The ρ–θ 
curve exhibits a two-fold symmetry. Figure 6 shows the ρ–Hred scaling obtained from 
the ρ–θ curves in Fig. 5 using Eq. (1). The scaling was performed by taking γs = 58, as 
shown in Fig. 6. Table I shows the superconducting anisotropies of PrO1-aFaBiS2 single 
crystals with various F concentrations. The γs values of the single crystals were 
calculated to be 20–58, and the high values of 53–58 were found in the single crystals of 
x = 0.3. This value is higher than that of a YBa2Cu3Oa (Y-123) high-Tc cuprate 
superconductor (γs = 45.8), which shows intrinsic Josephson junctions.29) Thus, the 
PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals of x = 0.3 were employed for the fabrication of s-shaped 
intrinsic Josephson junctions, as described below.

Figure 7 shows a scanning ion microscopy (SIM) image of the s-shaped junctions 
fabricated on the PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals of x = 0.3 along the c-axis. The 
cross-sectional area and thickness of the junctions are 5.4 × 5.7 μm2 along the ab-plane 
and 1.0 μm, respectively. The direction of current flow is shown in Fig. 7, which is 
along the c-axis in the junction. This junction was used for characterizing the transport 
properties along the c-axis. Figure 8 shows the ρ-T characteristics along the (a) ab-plane 
(ρab) and (b) c-axis (ρc) of a Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 (y = 0.18) single crystal, as 
measured by a standard four-probe method. The zero-resistivity temperature (Tc
zero) 
along the ab-plane was determined to be 2.95 K, whereas that along the c-axis 
decreased slightly to 2.70 K. Ga ions were likely implanted in the fabricated sample 
during the FIB etching, which possibly degraded the sample. This decrease in Tc
zero may 
be attributed to the damage caused by FIB etching. The normal-state anisotropies γn = 
(ρc/ρab)1/2 for Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single crystals at 5 and 250 K were found to be 
39.3 and 21.1, respectively. These results suggest that this layered compound shows a 
highly anisotropic transport even in the normal state. These γn values were lower than 
the γs values. The ρ–T relationship along the ab-plane (J//ab-plane) exhibits an anomaly 
at approximately 140 K and small kinks at ~70 K. The former anomaly is similar to 
those observed in NdO1-aFaBiS2 and LaO1-aFaBiSe2 single crystals,13,30) in which 


 
10
temperature may be related to F concentration.30) Thus, those anomalies would be 
intrinsic properties of BiS2- and BiSe2-based superconductors.30) The small kinks at ~70 
K along the ab-plane (J//ab-plane) and c-axis (J//c-axis) are reproducible; however, in 
origin is unclear.  
Figure 
9 
shows 
the 
I–V 
characteristics 
along 
the 
c-axis 
of 
the 
Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single crystal (shown in Fig. 7) at 2.0 K when T/Tc was around 
0.74. The critical current density (Jc) was approximately 1.33 × 103 A/cm2 in the 
self-field. The I–V curve shows a hysteresis. However, the multi branch structure of the 
I–V characteristics that corresponds to intrinsic Josephson junctions23,24) was not 
observed in the s-shaped Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single-crystal junctions.  
We measured the sample-position (the angle between the ab-plane and the 
magnetic field) dependence of the Vff characteristics under a magnetic field (H) for 
s-shaped Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single-crystal junctions (Fig. 10). We defined flow 
resistance as Vff divided by dc bias current (I) to conduct the measurements. Figure 10 
shows the sample-position dependence of the Vff characteristics at various Is along the 
c-axis of the s-shaped junctions in a 1.0 T magnetic field at 2.0 K. Figure 10(b) shows 
that Vff reaches a local maximum under a magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane. The 
local maximum Vff increases with increasing applied current. An increase in the local 


 
11
maximum Vff is also observed in the I–V characteristics under a magnetic field parallel 
to the ab-plane, as shown in Fig. 10(c). This phenomenon can be explained by the 
“lock-in” state,31,32) which may originate from the Josephson vortex flow. We expect 
that pancake vortices appear in Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single crystals owing to the high 
superconducting 
anisotropy. 
Vff 
markedly 
decreases 
under 
magnetic 
fields 
approximately parallel to the ab-plane, suggesting the dissipation of pancake vortices. 
Subsequently, Josephson vortices appear under magnetic fields parallel to the ab-plane, 
indicating the “lock-in” state. The lock-in state is expected to be free from pancake 
vortices, which cross the superconducting BiS2 layers. We observed periodic 
oscillations of Josephson-vortex flow resistance.29,33,34) The starting field of the periodic 
oscillations (Hs) was calculated from the following equation:29,35)  
Hs = Φ0/2πλjs,                        (2) 
where λj = γss expresses the size of the nonlinear Josephson-vortex core along the c-axis 
(frequently called the “Josephson penetration depth λj”), s is the length of a unit cell (= 
c-axis lattice constant of Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00), and Φ0 is the flux quantum (= 2.07 × 
10-15 Wb). Hs was calculated from Eq. (2) and was estimated to be 3.12 T for the 
s-shaped Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single-crystal junctions. However, no oscillation was 
observed until 7.0 T at 2.0 K. The absence of oscillation may be attributed to the 


 
12
measurement temperature; T/Tc is around 0.74 at 2.0 K. Although our results 
demonstrate that Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single crystals are promising candidates for 
use as intrinsic Josephson junctions, further investigations at lower temperatures are 
required.  
 
4. Conclusions 
We grew PrO1-aFaBiS2 single crystals with well-developed ab-planes 1–3 mm in size 
using CsCl/KCl flux. Increasing the F concentrations of the starting materials enhanced 
the substitution of F in the grown crystals. The superconducting Tc and γs values of 
PrO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.05–0.28) single crystals were estimated to be 2.4–4.6 K and 20–58, 
respectively. The normal-state anisotropies (γn) of Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 (x = 0.3, y = 
0.18) single crystals at 5 and 250 K were found to be 39.3 and 21.1, respectively. The 
s-shaped Pr1.05O0.82F0.18Bi1.03S2.00 single-crystal junctions under a magnetic field parallel 
to the ab-plane exhibited a lock-in state at 2.0 K.
