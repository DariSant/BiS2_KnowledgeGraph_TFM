Abstract 
R(O,F)BiS2 (R: La, Ce, Pr, Nd) superconducting single crystals with different F 
concentrations are grown using a CsCl/KCl flux. The obtained 1-2 mm-sized single 
crystals have a plate-like shape and are cleavable along the ab-plane. The crystal 
structure is tetragonal of space group P4/nmm (#129). The as-grown single crystals 
exhibit superconductivity at around 3-5 K. The superconducting transition temperature 
increases with decreasing the ionic radius of the R element. The superconducting 
anisotropies of the R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are estimated to be 30-60 according to the 
effective mass model, whereas the anisotropies for Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals are 
13-21. The c-axis transport measurements of a single crystal of Pr(O,F)BiS2 under a 
magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane reveal a “lock-in” state attributed to the 
Josephson vortex flow. Furthermore, the Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals exhibit a magnetic 
order at the temperature range of 5-7 K that apparently coexist with superconductivity 
below approximately 3 K.

1. Introduction 
Representative examples of BiS2-layered superconductors include Bi4O4S3 [1], 
R(O,F)BiS2 (R: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Yb) [2-6], AFBiS2 (A: Sr, Eu) [7-9], La1−bMbOBiS2 (M: 
Ti, Zr, Hf, Th) [10], Eu3F4Bi2S4 [11], and BiO1-cFcBiS2 [42,43]. Since R(O,F)BiS2 
shows similarity to the crystal structure of superconducting RnO1-dFdFeAs (Rn: rare 
earth elements) [12,13], much effort has been focused on the growth of single crystals 
thereof [14-18]. Alkali chloride fluxes, such as LiCl and NaCl, are generally useful for 
the growth of single crystals. However, R(O,F)BiS2 cannot be synthesized using LiCl 
and NaCl fluxes in a vacuum quartz tube at high temperatures because these alkali 
chlorides would corrode the quartz tube. A mixture of CsCl and KCl (CsCl/KCl) is a 
promising flux, as it exhibits little reactivity to quartz tubes at high temperatures 
[19-21].  
Various compositions of these single crystals are highly desired for investigating the 
effects of different R elements and F concentrations on the intrinsic properties of 
R(O,F)BiS2. When using polycrystalline samples, the intrinsic properties are masked by 
the impurities and grain boundaries and the anisotropic properties cannot be measured. 
Single crystals are also necessary for surface analyses by scanning tunnel microscopy 


 
4
(STM) and the fabrication of mono-layered devices [15,22,23], though these are not 
detailed in this paper.  
This review focuses on the growth and characterization of R(O,F)BiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, 
Nd) single crystals, which show not only superconductivity but also magnetism and 
high anisotropy. The growth of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was performed using 
CsCl/KCl flux. The composition and superconducting properties were investigated to 
characterize the properties of the single crystals. The crystal structural analysis was 
performed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), which revealed the relationship 
between the crystal structures and F concentrations of the crystals. The transport 
properties were examined to understand the intrinsic properties of these materials. The 
superconducting anisotropies of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were estimated and showed 
high values. The high anisotropy in layered superconductors demonstrates their 
potential use as intrinsic Josephson junctions, considering the weak coupling among 
BiS2-RO(F)-BiS2 (superconducting-normal-superconducting) layers along the c-axis 
[24,25]. Consequently, the c-axis transport property of the Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal 
was investigated. The coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in Ce(O,F)BiS2 
single crystals was confirmed as an intrinsic property, which has previously only been 
reported for polycrystalline samples [3,26].

2. Experimental Procedures  
2-1. Growth method for BiS2-layered superconducting single crystals 
Single crystals of R(O,F)BiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) were grown by a high-temperature 
flux method in a vacuumed quartz tube. Alkali metal chlorides were chosen as fluxes, of 
which CsCl, RbCl, and KCl had the low reactivity with the quartz tube. The melting 
temperature of CsCl (645 °C) is the lowest of these alkali metal chlorides. Additionally, 
a CsCl/KCl mixture with a eutectic temperature of approximately 616 °C is reported at 
the molar ratio of CsCl:KCl = 5:3 [27].  
The CsCl/KCl mixture (CsCl:KCl = 5:3) was employed for the flux. The raw materials 
for the growth of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were R2S3, Bi, Bi2S3, Bi2O3, BiF3, CsCl, 
and the CsCl/KCl mixture (CsCl:KCl = 5:3) flux [27]. The starting materials were 
weighed to obtain a nominal composition of RO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0-1.0). A mixture of raw 
materials (0.8 g) and the CsCl/KCl flux (5.0 g) were combined using a mortar, and then 
sealed in a quartz tube under vacuum (~10 Pa). This mixed powder was heated at 
800 °C for 10 h, cooled slowly to 600 °C at a rate of 1 °C/h, and then furnace-cooled to 
room temperature (around 20-30 °C), except for LaO0.9F0.1BiS2 (x = 0.1) and the F-free 


 
6
LaOBiS2, CeOBiS2 and PrOBiS2 single crystals. For LaO0.9F0.1BiS2, LaOBiS2 and 
PrOBiS2, the maximum heat treatment temperature was 1000 °C; other conditions were 
maintained. In PrOBiS2, the obtained single crystals were not only PrOBiS2 but also 
Bi2S3. Meanwhile, the flux for the growth of the CeOBiS2 single crystal was only 5.0 g 
CsCl; the mixed powder was heated at 950 °C for 10 h and cooled slowly to 650 °C at a 
rate of 1 °C/h. The quartz tube was opened in air, and the flux was dissolved in the 
quartz tube using distilled water. The remaining product was then filtered and washed 
with distilled water. R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals were collected from the product.  
 
2-2. Characterization of obtained single crystals 
The crystal structure, morphology, and composition of the obtained single crystals 
were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKα radiation, scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM), and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Single-crystal XRD data 
were 
collected 
using 
a 
Rigaku 
XTALAB-MINI 
diffractometer 
with 
graphite-monochromated MoKα radiation. The data were corrected for the Lorentz and 
polarization effects. The crystal structure was solved and refined using computer 
programs from the Crystal Structure crystallographic software package [28]. The crystal 
structure was then drawn by VESTA computer software [29]. The superconducting 


 
7
properties of the grown single crystals were also evaluated. The superconducting 
transition temperature (Tc) was estimated from the temperature dependence of 
magnetization by a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer 
with an applied field of 10 Oe. The transport properties of the single crystals were 
measured by a standard four-probe method with a constant current density (J) using a 
Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design; PPMS DynaCool). The 
electrical terminals were fabricated from Ag (silver) paste. The angular (θ) dependence 
of resistivity (ρ) in the flux liquid state was measured under various magnetic fields (H), 
with the superconducting anisotropy (γs) calculated using the effective mass model 
[30-32]. For the c-axis transport measurement, s-shaped junction of the Pr(O,F)BiS2 
single crystal fixed on a single-crystal substrate of SrTiO3 was fabricated by a 
three-dimensional (3D) focused ion beam (FIB) etching method using a Ga-ion beam 
[33,34]. Normal-state anisotropy (γn) was estimated from the resistivity-temperature 
(ρ–T) characteristics of the as-grown (J//ab-plane) and s-shaped junction (J//c-axis) 
samples. The current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of the s-shaped junction sample were 
measured by the standard four-probe method. The sample-position (angle between the 
ab-plane and the magnetic field) dependence of the flow voltage (Vff) of the s-shaped 
junction sample was measured under a magnetic field for Josephson vortex research. 


 
8
The magnetic properties of the Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals including the temperature 
(T) dependence of magnetization (M) under zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling 
(FC) were measured by a SQUID magnetometer, with a magnetic field of 10 Oe applied 
parallel to the c-axis. Magnetization-magnetic field (M–H) curves with the magnetic 
field applied parallel to the c-axis were also measured.  
 
 
3. Results 
3.1 Growth of single crystals 
R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals appeared with impurities of Bi2S3 and ROCl. The amount 
of these impurities increased with decreasing the amount of the flux. R(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystals were found to be plate-like in shape. Figure 1 shows a typical SEM image of 
the obtained Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystal, which are 1.0-2.0 mm in size and 10-20 μm in 
thickness [14]. The decrease of the temperature, the slow cooling time, or both produced 
very small single crystals. For example, the heat treatment condition of 730 °C for 10 h 
and then slow cooling to 630 °C at 1 °C/h produced single crystals of around 20 μm. 
Figure 2 shows the XRD pattern of a well-developed plane in a single crystal grown 
from the starting materials with the nominal composition of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The XRD 


 
9
pattern of figure 2 shows the presence of only 00l diffraction peaks of the NdOBiS2 
crystal structure, indicating that the ab-plane is well developed. Thus, the growth rate in 
the c-axis direction is less than that of the a-axis direction. The in-plane orientation of 
the ab-plane in the grown crystals was not measured.  
Table I summarizes the nominal F composition (x) and the rare earth elements (R) in 
the starting materials, as well as the analytical F composition (y), c-axis lattice 
parameter (c), Tc, and superconducting anisotropy (γs) in the grown single crystals. 
Details of γs are described in section 3.3. The F composition is normalized by the total F 
and O content. The y values in the Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals measured by EPMA 
were overestimated because the characteristic X-ray signals of F-Kα (677 eV) and 
Ce-Mζ (676 eV) overlapped [35]. The overlapped signals were measured from the F-free 
CeOBiS2 single crystal, which was estimated to be y = 0.37. Thus, the y value in the 
Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals was calculated by subtracting the overlapped signals 
estimated from the F-free CeOBiS2 single crystal. Meanwhile, the chemical ratio of 
R:Bi:S in the crystals as determined by EPMA was 1 ± 0.08:1 ± 0.06:2; this ratio is in 
agreement with stoichiometry. No Cs, K, or Cl was detected in the crystals by EPMA at 
the minimum sensitivity limit of 0.1 wt%.  
On increasing the value of x, the value of y also increases and reaches saturation at 


 
10
0.45 (R = La), 0.29 (R = Ce), 0.26 (R = Pr), and 0.42 (R = Nd) when x exceeds around 
0.6. The increase in x decreases the c-axis lattice parameters (c), but provides almost 
equivalent values as when x ≥ 0.6 (R = Pr, x ≥ 0.5). The minimum c-axis lattice 
parameter is about 13.4 Å regardless of the R used.  
Single crystals of La(O,F)BiS2 and Ce(O,F)BiS2 with x ≤ 0.3 did not exhibit 
superconductivity down to 2 K. When x ≥ 0.4, superconducting transition temperatures 
(Tc) were observed at around 3 K. Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystals showed a 
superconducting transition of about 4 K, except those with x ≤ 0.1, which could not be 
measured in this system because of the small size of the obtained crystals. The 
maximum Tc of approximately 5 K was observed in the Nd(O,F)BiS2 single crystals.  
 
3.2 Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis 
Single-crystal structural analysis of R(O,F)BiS2 was performed using Nd(O,F)BiS2 
grown under conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 0.29. The structural analysis showed that the 
crystal structure belonged to the tetragonal space group P4/nmm (#129) with a = 
3.996(3) Å and c = 13.464(6) Å [14]. Structural refinement was performed on the 
NdOBiS2 model because of the difficulty in distinguishing between O and F. The final 
refinement was performed with fixed occupancies of unity for Nd, Bi, S, and O. As 


 
11
shown in figure 3 [14], the crystal structure of NdOBiS2 is composed of stacked Nd2O2 
layers and Bi2S4 layers, isostructural with LaOBiS2 [2]. The F composition dependence 
of the crystal structure was revealed by the La(O,F)BiS2 single crystals, in which Bi-S 
planes became flatter with increasing F contents [36]. The single-crystal structural 
analysis of Ce(O,F)BiS2 was systematically performed, which provided more details on 
the relationship between F composition and crystal structure [37]. The structural 
parameters of single crystals the Ce(O,F)BiS2 grown under conditions of x = 0.3-0.9 and 
y = 0.16-0.29 are summarized in table II [37]. The definition of atomic positions in 
Ce(O,F)BiS2 is shown in figure 4 [37]. According to table II, while the increase in F 
content does not significantly affect the Bi−S(1) bond length, it does change the 
S(1)−Bi−S(1) angle. In samples with high F concentrations (Ex: Crystal 3-5), this angle 
is nearly flat, whereas in a low-F concentration sample (Ex: Crystal 1) it is slightly 
zigzag. These changes are consistent with the results of the single-crystal analysis of 
La(O,F)BiS2 [36]. The increase in F concentration increases the Bi−S(2) and Ce−(O,F) 
bond distances, but decreases the Ce−S(2) bond distance. This agrees with the reported 
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analysis of powder samples of 
Ce(O,F)BiS2 [38]. The angles of the S(1)−Bi−S(2) and Ce−(O,F)−Ce bonds decreased 
with increasing F concentration. On the other hand, the S(2)−Ce−S(2) bond angle 


 
12
increased.  
 
3.3 Superconducting anisotropies of BiS2-layered single crystals 
The temperature dependence of resistivity in the R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals differed 
significantly under variation in the angle of an applied magnetic field H, between 
parallel to the ab-plane and to the c-axis. This suggests that R(O,F)BiS2 is a 
high-anisotropy material. Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of resistivity in a 
single crystal of Nd(O,F)BiS2 grown under the conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 0.29 at 
temperatures below 10 K under H = 0-9.0 T, parallel to the (a) ab-plane and (b) c-axis 
[14]. The suppression of the critical temperature under H applied parallel to the c-axis is 
more significant than that under H parallel to the ab-plane. The field dependences of 
Tc
onset and Tc
zero under H parallel to the ab-plane (H//ab-plane) and to the c-axis 
(H//c-axis) are plotted in figure 6 [14]. The linear extrapolations of Tc
onset for the cases 
of H//ab-plane and H//c-axis approach the values of 42 and 1.3 T, respectively. 
Therefore, the upper critical fields H//ab
C2 and H//c
C2 at zero temperature are estimated to 
be 29 and 0.90 T, as determined by the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) theory 
[44]:  
HC2(0) = −0.693Tc(dHC2/dT)Tc                 (1) 


 
13
In a BCS superconductor in the weak-coupling limit, the Pauli limit is Hp = 1.84Tc [45], 
which corresponds to 9.4 T (Tc = 5.1 K) for the single-crystal Nd(O,F)BiS2 grown under 
conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 0.29. In conventional superconductor, HC2(0) is limited by 
Pauli limit as the Hp. However, the value of H//ab
C2 was 29 which is larger than the Hp. 
This result indicates R(O,F)BiS2 superconductors are possibility of unconventional 
superconductor. By linear fitting the Tc
zero data, the irreversibility fields H//ab
irr and H//c
irr 
are found to be 16 and 0.64 T, respectively. This indicates that the Nd(O,F)BiS2 
superconductor has high anisotropy. The superconducting anisotropy (γs) as evaluated 
from the ratio of the upper critical field, using the equation:  
γs = H//ab
C2/H//c
C2 = ξab/ξc  (ξ: coherence length)          (2) 
was 32.2 for the single-crystal Nd(O,F)BiS2 grown under conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 
0.29.  
Moreover, the superconducting anisotropy of superconducting Nd(O,F)BiS2 was 
estimated using the effective mass model. The angular (θ) dependence of resistivity (ρ) 
was measured under different H in the flux liquid state to estimate γs, as reported in Refs. 
30 and 31. The reduced field (Hred) was calculated using the following equation for an 
effective mass model:  
Hred = H(sin2θ + γs
-2cos2θ)1/2                    (3) 


 
14
where θ is the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field [32] and Hred is 
calculated from H and θ. The superconducting anisotropy (γs) was estimated from a best 
scaling of the ρ–Hred relationship. Figure 7 displays the θ dependence of ρ for H = 
0.1-9.0 T in the flux liquid state for a single crystal of Nd(O,F)BiS2 grown under 
conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 0.29 [14]. Small dips are observed in the ρ–θ curves 
around the H//c-axis at H < 0.6 T. These dips presumably originate from small cracks, 
which behave as weak pinning sites in the single crystal. The ρ–θ curve exhibits a 
twofold symmetry. Figure 8 shows the ρ–Hred scaling obtained from the ρ–θ curves in 
figure 7 using Eq. (3) [14]. The scaling was performed by taking γs = 30, as shown in 
figure 8. The value of γs estimated from the effective mass model was consistent with 
that of using Eq. (2). The γs of R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with various x and R elements 
were estimated from the effective mass model, as summarized in table I. The γs of the 
crystal was estimated to be 30–60 when R = La, Pr, and Nd; the value of γs was 
especially high for R = Pr, while it was lower than expected (13–21) for R = Ce. The 
origin of this variation is unclear.  
 
3.4 C-axis transport properties of PrO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals 
 Single crystals are suitable for anisotropic measurements. The differences in transport 


 
15
properties between in-plane (ab-plane) and out-of-plane (c-axis) using the Pr(O,F)BiS2 
single crystal are demonstrated in this chapter. The superconducting anisotropies of 
single crystals of Pr(O,F)BiS2 grown under conditions of x = 0.3 and y = 0.18 were 
estimated to be around 55, demonstrating the potential use of the crystals as intrinsic 
Josephson junctions along the c-axis [24,25]. Intrinsic Josephson junctions emerge in 
the crystal structures of layered superconductors. The s-shaped junction of the 
Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal was fabricated for the c-axis transport measurement [33,34]. 
Figure 9 shows a scanning ion microscopy (SIM) image along the c-axis of the s-shaped 
junctions fabricated on the Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with x = 0.3 and y = 0.18 [39]. 
The cross-sectional area and thickness of the junctions are 5.4 × 5.7 μm2 along the 
ab-plane and 1.0 μm, respectively. The direction of current flow is shown in figure 9, 
along the c-axis in the junction. This junction is used to characterize the transport 
properties along the c-axis. Figure 10 shows the ρ–T characteristics along the (a) 
ab-plane (ρab) and (b) c-axis (ρc) of the Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with x = 0.3 and y = 
0.18, as measured by the standard four-probe method [39]. The normal-state 
anisotropies γn = (ρc/ρab)1/2 at 5 and 250 K are found to be 39.3 and 21.1, respectively. 
These γn values are lower than the γs values.  
Figure 11 shows the I–V characteristics along the c-axis (shown in figure 9) at 2.0 K 


 
16
[39]. The critical current density (Jc) is approximately 1.33 × 103 A/cm2 in the self-field. 
The I–V curve shows a hysteresis. However, the multi-branched structure of the I–V 
characteristics corresponding to intrinsic Josephson junctions [33,34] is not observed in 
the I–V curve of the s-shaped junction of the Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with x = 0.3 and 
y = 0.18.  
The sample-position (the angle between the ab-plane and the magnetic field) 
dependence of the Vff characteristics under H for s-shaped single-crystal junction 
(Figure 9) was measured. Flow resistance was defined as Vff divided by the 
direct-current (dc) bias current (I) to conduct the measurements. Figure 12 shows the 
sample-position dependence of the Vff characteristics at various I values along the c-axis 
of the s-shaped junctions under 1.0 T magnetic field at 2.0 K [39]. Figure 12(b) shows 
that Vff reaches a local maximum under a magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane. The 
local maximum Vff increases with increasing applied current. An increase in the local 
maximum Vff is also observed in the I–V characteristics under H parallel to the ab-plane, 
as shown in figure 12(c). This phenomenon can be explained by the “lock-in” state 
[40,41], which may originate from the Josephson vortex flow. This result indicates that 
pancake vortices appear in the Pr(O,F)BiS2 single crystal with x = 0.3 and y = 0.18 due 
to the high superconducting anisotropy of the crystal. Vff markedly decreases under H 


 
17
approximately parallel to the ab-plane, suggesting the dissipation of these pancake 
vortices. Subsequently, Josephson vortices appear under H parallel to the ab-plane, 
indicating the “lock-in” state. The lock-in state is expected to be free from pancake 
vortices, which cross the superconducting BiS2 layers.  
 
3.5 Magnetic properties of CeO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals 
Ce(O,F)BiS2 exhibits the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism in 
polycrystalline samples [3,26]. Although the existence of both superconductivity and 
magnetic ordering in mixed anion compounds has been observed by different groups, 
the values reported for these properties have differed. This may be attributed to the 
inhomogeneity of powder samples or the effects of impurity phases and grain 
boundaries on the sample characterization. As only powder samples have been analyzed, 
it is important to further examine the structural and property details in single-crystal 
analysis [37]. Figure 13 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity (ρ–T) and 
magnetization (M–T) for single crystals of Ce(O,F)BiS2 grown under conditions of x = 
0.3-0.9 and y = 0.16-0.29, between 2−10 K [37]. In the ρ–T characteristics, all crystals 
exhibit semi-conductive behavior in the normal region, consistent with previous reports 
of Ce(O,F)BiS2 powders with different F concentrations [3,6,26].  


 
18
The M−T curve of Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.3 and y = 0.16 shows no 
clear transition. The single crystals of Ce(O,F)BiS2 grown under conditions of x = 
0.5-0.9 and y = 0.24-0.29 show a decrease in magnetization at around 3 K, which 
corresponds to the superconducting transition temperature (Tc). Additionally, a deviation 
between ZFC and FC was found in Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.5 and y = 
0.24 near 5 K, which suggests spontaneous magnetization. This deviation is enhanced, 
and its onset shifted to higher temperatures, with increasing F concentration; in 
Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.9 and y = 0.29, the onset is near 7 K. These 
temperatures of magnetic ordering were defined as Tm, which are summarized in table II. 
Further characterization of these single crystals is required in order to investigate the 
origin of this phenomenon.  
Figure 14 shows the M−H curve of the Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals with x = 0.9 and y 
= 0.29 at 2 K [37]. The hysteresis loop observed supports the theory of spontaneous 
magnetization. The saturating magnetization was ca. 0.02 μB/Ce [37], much smaller 
than that expected for the Ce3+ free ion (2.54 μB/Ce). The value of the lower critical 
field (Hc1) for superconductivity, attributed to the superconductivity, is 10−20 Oe.

4. Conclusion 
The growth of R(O,F)BiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) single crystals was achieved by using 
CsCl/KCl flux containing varying rare earth metals and F compositions. The 
characterization of the obtained single crystals clarified the detailed crystal structures, 
transport properties, and magnetic properties. An increase in the nominal F 
compositions in the starting materials was found to enhance the values of F 
concentration in the obtained single crystals. On increasing the nominal F composition, 
the analytical F composition also increased and reached saturation at 0.45 (R = La), 0.29 
(R = Ce), 0.26 (R = Pr), and 0.42 (R = Nd) when the nominal F composition exceeded 
around 0.6. The Bi-S planes of the R(O,F)BiS2 single crystals became flatter with 
increasing F concentration, according to the single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. 
The superconducting anisotropies of the obtained single crystals were estimated to be 
30–60 when R = La, Pr and Nd. The anisotropy was especially high for R = Pr, whereas 
the value was lower than expected (13–21) when R = Ce. Ce(O,F)BiS2 single crystals 
exhibited a magnetic order at about 5-7 K in addition to the superconducting transition 
at approximately 3 K, which suggested that the coexistence of superconductivity and 
magnetism in Ce(O,F)BiS2 was intrinsic. The s-shaped junction of Pr(O,F)BiS2 single 
crystal with x = 0.3 and y = 0.18 under a magnetic field parallel to the ab-plane of the 


 
20
crystal exhibited a “lock-in” state for Josephson vortex flow.
