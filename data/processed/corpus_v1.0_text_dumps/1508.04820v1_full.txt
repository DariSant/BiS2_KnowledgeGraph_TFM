Recent ARPES measurements [Phys. Rev. B 92, 041113 (2015)] have conﬁrmed the one-dimensional charac-
ter of the electronic structure of CeO0.5F0.5BiS2, a representative of BiS2-based superconductors. In addition,
several members of this family present sizable increase in the superconducting transition temperature Tc under
application of hydrostatic pressure. Motivated by these two results, we propose a one-dimensional three-orbital
model, whose kinetic energy part, obtained through ab initio calculations, is supplemented by pair-scattering
terms, which are treated at the mean-ﬁeld level. We solve the gap equations self-consistently and then system-
atically probe which combination of pair-scattering terms gives results consistent with experiment, namely, a
superconducting dome with a maximum Tc at the right chemical potential and a sizable increase in Tc when
the magnitude of the hoppings is increased. For these constraints to be satisﬁed multi-gap superconductivity is
required, in agreement with experiments, and one of the hoppings has a dominant inﬂuence over the increase of
Tc with pressure.

Introduction. After the discovery of the cuprates in 19861,
the search for new layered superconducting materials has at-
tracted much attention, with important discoveries occurring
in the last 15 years. For example, it was discovered in 2001
that MgB2 has Tc = 39 K2 and in 2008 superconductivity
(SC) in the iron pnictides was reported3. Both MgB2 and
the iron pnictides have highlighted the importance of multi-
band SC4, to the point that the recent literature on cuprates
devoted to multiband models has substantially increased5. An
unrelated development has been the explosion of research in
topological superconductors6, due to proposals to ‘engineer’
Majorana fermion quasiparticles through midgap excitations
of a chiral p-wave superconductor. This has led to renewed
interest in the Ruthenate compound Sr2RuO4, discovered in
19947, which is one of the few candidates to realizing p-
wave-type SC8,9, another candidate being the organic super-
conductor (TMTSF)2PF6. It should also be emphasized that,
as was the case for intermetallics with A15 structure (like
Nb3Sn or V3Si)10, the Ruthenates display ‘hidden’ quasi-one-
dimensional (quasi-1d) SC11 (while organic superconductors
are explicitly 1d). Finally, we also mention SC in doped semi-
conductors, studied since before the 60s12, with the interest
greatly increasing after the discovery of SC in Boron-doped
Diamond with Tc = 4 K13.
It is then interesting that one of the latest families of
layered superconductors to be discovered, those containing
BiS2 planes,14 presents many of the characteristics mentioned
above: a layered structure, similar to cuprates and pnictides15;
a double superconducting gap as in MgB216; its minimal
model contains two bands17, and Fermi surface nesting effects
seem to be important18 (as in the iron pnictides); because it
contains a heavy element (Bismuth), spin-orbit effects are en-
hanced and some proposals linking BiS2 to spin-triplet pair-
ing and a weak topological superconducting state have been
made19; based on ﬁrst-principles electronic structure calcula-
tions, it has been pointed out the ‘subtle’ 1d character of its
band structure17, which has been recently conﬁrmed exper-
imentally through polarization-dependent Angular Resolved
Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements20; ﬁ-
nally, a few members of the BiS2 family have semiconduct-
ing parent compounds that become metallic/superconducting
with electron doping or application of moderate hydrostatic
pressure, which also can lead to sizable increase in Tc21.
In this work, to advance the understanding of SC in BiS2,
where there is no consensus yet if it is of the conventional
or unconventional type22, we concentrate in these last two
aspects: one-dimensionality of the electronic structure and
the pronounced effects pressure has over the superconducting
phase. To model that, the authors take the following approach:
i) adopt a 1d three-orbital model for BiS2, adding the Cooper-
pairing by hand, ii) solve the gap equations at the mean-
ﬁeld level, iii) study the dependence of the superconducting
gap with the variation of the hopping terms, whose magni-
tude one expects to increase under applied pressure iv) de-
cide on the acceptance or not of speciﬁc pair-scattering terms
based on semi-quantitative agreement with experiments. Re-
garding this last point, we look speciﬁcally in what range
of electron-ﬁlling a superconducting dome is obtained (see
Fig. 3) and how SC varies with hopping parameters.
To
make the connection with BiS2 more explicit, and thus obtain
semi-quantitative agreement with experiments, all the param-
eter values of the single-particle Hamiltonian were obtained
through ﬁrst-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) cal-
culations for a two-dimensional (2d) ﬁve-band model (see Ta-
ble I).
We can summarize our results as follows: Taking into ac-
count a three-orbital model, where Sulfur contributes with or-
bitals s and p, and Bismuth with a p orbital (see Fig. 1), we
considered all possible pair-scattering terms (intra and inter-
band, restricted to pairs formed by same-band electrons), in-
dividually and in conjunction, and solved the resulting gap
equations at the mean-ﬁeld level. We obtain that i) no single-
band pair-scattering process, acting isolatedly, can describe
the experiments (as speciﬁcally deﬁned above), unless an un-

realistic coupling is assumed (g > 0.1 eV); this seems to indi-
cate that multi-gap SC is a natural consequence of our model
ii) two different types of multi-gap SC (see detailed descrip-
tion below) are in semi-quantitative agreement with experi-
ments iii) the gap dependence with hopping (see Fig. 4) indi-
cates a qualitative difference between the two hoppings con-
sidered in our model. These important results establish an
appropriate effective 1d model to simulate the properties of
BiS2. We expect that our work will motivate other groups to
investigate other similar purely 1d effective models.
Model. We consider a linear chain with a unit cell con-
sisting of two sites denoted a and b, see Fig. 1. The a sites
(Sulfur) have orbitals s and p, while b sites (Bismuth) have
just one p orbital. In second quantization notation, the anni-
hilation operator for an s orbital in unit cell n is denoted as
cn, and those for Sulfur and Bismuth p orbitals are denoted
pa,n and pb,n, respectively. The non-interacting part of the
Hamiltonian can then be written as

i,npi,n are the number operators, and µ is
the chemical potential. The hopping parameters are indicated
in Fig. 1 and the values used in this work (along with orbital
energies and chemical potential) are listed in Table I in eV
units. Note that these parameter values were obtained through
a full DFT calculation. The hoppings kept for the 1d model
here studied were all the nearest neighbor hoppings in excess
of 0.5 eV.
An early 2d minimal model for BiS2 contains two orbitals:
Bismuth px and py orbitals17. Therefore, before deriving the

FIG. 2: Density of states obtained through DFT for the ﬁve-orbital
model of the LaOBiS2 compound. Note the importance of the Sulfur
s-orbitals [dot-dashed (green) line] at the Fermi energy (EF = 0),
justifying its inclusion in the model described in Fig. 1. In addition,
the sequence of van Hove singularities at the bottom of the conduc-
tion band and at the top of the valence band indicates the quasi-1d
character of the electronic structure.
s orbitals should be justiﬁed, mainly the latter one, which lies
deep below the Fermi energy (see DFT parameter values in
Table I). Figure 2 shows the density of states (DOS) obtained
for a 2d model of BiS2 involving ﬁve orbitals: two Bismuth
p orbitals (px and py), two Sulfur p orbitals (px and py), and
one Sulfur s orbital. From the examination of the DOS one
can conclude that, at the Fermi energy EF = 0 (which, in
this plot, is between 1/8- and 1/4-ﬁlling, for the 2d model),
the participation of the Sulfur s orbital [dot-dashed (green)
curve], is quite relevant, even more than that of the Sulfur p
orbitals [dashed (blue) curve]. In addition, it is easy to rec-
ognize the characteristic 1d DOS proﬁle for the Sulfur p or-
bital at the top of the valence band and for the Bismuth p and
Sulfur s orbitals at the bottom of the conduction band. This,
coupled to the above mentioned polarized ARPES results in-
dicating the one-dimensionality of the electronic structure of
BiS2, justiﬁes our model. We now proceed to the derivation
of the self-consistent gap equations.

plicit in the form of the expression for the pair-scattering term
that we are only considering Cooper pairs composed of elec-
trons from the same band, as pairing of different-band elec-
trons tends to promote pair-density-waive (inhomogeneous)
superconducting ground states24. Already anticipating results
that will be discussed below (see Fig. 3), we describe how to
obtain the gap equations when an speciﬁc set of pair-scattering
processes are taken in account. Considering terms involving
intraband scattering in the s and pb bands and interband scat-
tering between the s and pb bands, the last line of eq. (2)
(which we denote as ∆SC) can be written as

FIG. 3: Pairing interaction ∆as a function of the chemical potential
µ for different values of the coupling constant g. These results were
obtained for the tight-binding parameter values listed in Table I. The
value of µ at the center of the dome corresponds to an electron ﬁlling
close to the one in BiS2 compounds where SC has been observed
(1/8-ﬁlling). The inset shows results for a larger value of g, which
stabilizes the superconducting phase in a much broader interval of µ.
We want to derive a self-consistent equation for ∆and
then analyze the effect of variations in the hopping pa-
rameters over it.
In order to determine the correlations
⟨c¯k−ck+⟩and ⟨pb,¯k−pb,k+⟩in the gap equation, we need
to calculate the anomalous Green’s functions ⟨⟨ck+; c¯k−⟩⟩
and ⟨⟨pb,k+; pb,¯k−⟩⟩.
These calculations are long and te-
dious, and thus are presented in the supplemental material25.
After writing the equation of motion for the propagators
⟨⟨pb,k+; pb,¯k−⟩⟩and ⟨⟨ck+; c¯k−⟩⟩, and through lengthy alge-
braic manipulations, we arrive at expressions for ∆1 and ∆2

which, after the simplifying step mentioned above, results in

Results. As mentioned in the Introduction, our strategy was
to solve the gap equations at the mean-ﬁeld level (hopping am-
plitudes ﬁxed at the values obtained by DFT), and look for so-
lutions at least qualitatively compatible with experiments, i.e.,
for chemical potential values around 1/8-ﬁlling and for cou-
pling strengths g that are not unrealistically large. Taking in
account the pair-scattering terms in eq. (4) and following the
derivations up to eq. (7), we obtain the gap function ∆, which
has a dependence with µ as shown in Fig. 3, for three different
values of coupling g. It is interesting to note that the value of
µ around which the three domes are centered corresponds to


4
an electron ﬁlling close to that where SC has been found for
most members of the BiS2 family, i.e., 1/8-ﬁlling26. This is an
important result, as µ was not ﬁxed from the start. It is taken
as a free parameter, whose value, obtained self-consistently,
was used to determine which gap equations (for speciﬁc pair-
scattering terms) produced acceptable results. Indeed, if the
value of µ for which SC was found is too far removed from
1/8-ﬁlling, that gap equation (and the pair-scattering term gen-
erating it) is rejected.
If one takes the maximum value obtained for ∆in Fig. 3 for
g = 25 meV [(red) circles], ∆≈4 meV, and uses the BCS re-
lation 2∆/kBTc = 3.52, one obtains Tc ≈26 K. A maximum
Tc ≈11 K has been found for LaO1−xFxBiS2 at 1/8-ﬁlling
(x = 0.5)27, indicating that our results, for a realistic value of
g, produce a Tc qualitatively similar to experiments. A com-
ment should be made on the horizontal width of the dome for
the (red) solid circles curve in Fig. 3. At the base of the dome,
the electron ﬁlling varies roughly from 0.25 to 0.26 electrons
per pb-orbital (Bismuth). Although there is still some contro-
versy about the actual ﬁlling around which SC occurs26, a few
of the published Tc vs. doping results indicate a broader dome.
We believe that the narrower dome we obtain is an artifact of
the 1d model. Indeed, the DOS close to 1/8-ﬁlling for our 1d
model (not shown) has a very pronounced van Hove singular-
ity, therefore a very strong variation of DOS with the chemical
potential. This strong dependence, for smaller values of g (as
the ones plotted in the main panel in Fig. 3), seems to result in
a superconducting phase that is very sensitive to the chemical
potential, leading to a narrow dome. In the inset to Fig. 3, we
show results for a larger g = 280 meV value. In it, we see
a much broader variation in electron ﬁlling, from 0.2 to 0.31
[(black) open diamonds curve]. The actual system is quasi-1d,
implying that once a three-dimensional superconducting state
stabilizes, it will be less sensitive to variations in the chemical
potential. To have the same effect in a purely 1d model we
have to increase the pairing coupling, as shown in the inset to
Fig. 3.
It is reasonable to expect that applying hydrostatic pressure
in a crystal lattice will enhance the overlap between the or-
bitals and therefore increase the magnitude of the hopping
terms. Taking the reasonable assumption that this increase
is similar to the change in lattice parameter, which for an ap-
plied pressure of 2 GPa will amount to a change of ≈1%28,
we solve the gap equations for increasing values (in magni-
tude) of tsp and plot the results in Fig. 4 for some µ values
in the dome region in Fig. 3 (for g = 81 meV). For a varia-
tion of |tsp| ≈0.5% the value of ∆roughly doubles, which is
in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental results for
Tc obtained for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS229. A
similar calculation for the variation in tpp (not shown) shows
no changes in ∆, up to the same percent variation as for tsp.
This seems to be consistent with previous results23 showing
that antisymmetric hybridization is very effective in increas-
ing the SC gap amplitude. To test this hypothesis, extensive
calculations are underway where the condition gss = gpbpb =
gspb = g is relaxed30.
There is another choice of pair-scattering terms in eq. (4)
which produces results (not shown) very similar to the ones
FIG. 4: Results showing the dependence of ∆with tsp for a few
values of the chemical potential µ in the dome region in Fig. 3 for
g = 81 meV and tpapb = −0.8155eV . The overall variation in
the magnitude of tsp is ≈0.4%, which is a typical lattice parameter
variation under typical hydrostatic pressure experiments.
just described. One just needs to replace s by pa in eq. (4).
As already mentioned, these two were the only situations
where the results obtained were compatible with the criteria
described above for acceptance of the gap equation results.
For all the other possibilities, either the coupling parameter
g was unrealistically large or the electron-ﬁlling was too far
removed from 1/8-ﬁlling.
Conclusions. Motivated by recent experiments in supercon-
ducting members of the BiS2 family of compounds showing
its ‘hidden’ 1d electronic structure and the strong effect that
pressure has over its superconducting state, we propose an ef-
fective 1d model where the kinetic energy part of the Hamilto-
nian is obtained through DFT calculations for the 2d model for
BiS2. Supported by the DOS results shown in Fig. 2, we add
the Sulfur p- and s-orbital to the p-orbital of Bismuth. Despite
being several eV below the other two orbitals, the s-orbital un-
dergoes strong hybridization with the Bismuth p-orbital and
has a sizable contribution to the DOS at the Fermi energy,
justifying its inclusion in the model (see Figs. 1 and 2). Pair
scattering terms are then added and treated at the mean-ﬁeld
level. We solve the gap equations and systematically probe
what combination of pair-scattering terms produce results in
qualitative agreement with the experiments, i.e., approximate
location of the superconducting phase in a T vs. doping phase
diagram, realistic coupling constant values, and dependence
with hopping parameters (simulating application of hydro-
static pressure). We ﬁnd that single-gap SC does not produce
acceptable results. This is quite relevant, as there is experi-
mental evidence that BiS2 presents two gaps27. We ﬁnd that if
we consider s- and pb-type pairs, and allow for intra and inter-
band scattering we obtain results in semi-quantitative agree-
ment with experiments. The same is true if we choose pa- and
pb-type pairs, and also allow for intra and interband scatter-
ing. The interesting point here is that the tsp hopping is the
one that, in both cases, enhances SC when its magnitude in-


5
creases, whereas the effect on ∆of increasing tpp is marginal.
This last point reinforces the need for considering the Sulfur s
orbital explicitly. We argue that the anti-symmetric character
of the tsp hopping (as stressed in previous work by one of the
authors23) may explain its enhanced effect in the supercon-
ducting state.

26 Most of the studies reporting Tc vs. x results were conducted on
polycrystalline samples and the maximum Tc was obtained for
x = 0.5, corresponding to 0.5 electron per Bismuth, i.e., 1/8-
ﬁlling, as each Bismuth has two active orbitals (px and py). Re-
cently, a study on the electronic structure of NdO1−xFxBiS2 sin-
gle crystals was reported and it was found that the charge car-
rier doping is smaller than that expected from the nominal x
value. This was attributed to Bismuth deﬁciency? . The results we
obtain here agree with the nominal concentation (1/8-ﬁlling for
maximum Tc), which corresponds to 0.25 electron per Bismuth
(µ = 0.5007) in the 1d model (with one p orbital per Bismuth).

where γ stands for the annihilation operators c or pb, and η →
0. In order to calculate the propagators we will write their
equations of motion (taking from now on ℏ= 1)

where H(k) is the Hamiltonian for the system (eq. (2) in the
main text) and {, } and [, ] indicate an anticommutator and a
commutator, respectively.
Let us develop further the equation of motion for the ﬁrst
propagator (⟨⟨ck+; c¯k−⟩⟩). Making use of standard relations
for fermion creation and annihilation operators, we obtain

In the process above, two new propagators were created,
⟨⟨pbk+; c¯k−⟩⟩and ⟨⟨c†
¯k−; c¯k−⟩⟩. In order to close the sys-
tem of equations for the propagators, we need also the equa-
tion of motion for ⟨⟨c†
¯k−; c¯k−⟩⟩, ⟨⟨pbk+; c¯k−⟩⟩, ⟨⟨p†
b¯k−; c¯k−⟩⟩,
⟨⟨pak+; c¯k−⟩⟩, and ⟨⟨p†
a¯k−; c¯k−⟩⟩. This procedure generates a
system of equations given by

and ¯tpapb = 2tpapb cos(k).
Using Cramer’s method to solve the system of equations in
(5), we have that
⟨⟨ck+; c¯k−⟩⟩= |Dss|
|D|
(7)
where the matrix Dss is obtained by exchanging the 4th col-
umn in matrix D by the column matrix deﬁned in the right
side of eq. (5) (note that |D| means the determinant of ma-
trix D). Repeating the same procedure for ⟨⟨pbk+; pb¯k−⟩⟩we
obtain

and Dpbpb is obtained by exchanging the 5th column in matrix
D by the column matrix deﬁned in the right side of eq. (8). In
eqs. (7) and (9), |D| is a biquadratic polynomial of degree six
and can be rewriten as

where the last equation is obtained by noting that ω1 = −ω4,
ω2 = −ω5, and ω3 = −ω6. Here, An and Bn are coefﬁcients
which are functions of the parameters of the Hamiltonian. ωn
are the zeros of |D| and represent the energy excitations of
the system. The solutions for ωk ≡ω cannot be found analyt-
ically. Actually, these quantities will be obtained numerically.
To ﬁnally determine the gap equations, it is appropriate to
make use of the following identity

Substituting eq. (11) into eqs. (7) and (9), and after using

Substituting eq. (15) into the equations for ∆1 and ∆2 in

the following self-consistent equations
