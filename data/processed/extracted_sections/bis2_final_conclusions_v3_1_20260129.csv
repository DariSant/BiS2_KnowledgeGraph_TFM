True,"the physical properties of Bi4O4S3, the Tc onset and Tc zero are 8.6 K and 4.5 K at 0 T, respectively. The broadness of the transition is probably caused by an inhomogeneity of the local structure and/or career doping level. Next, we show the crystal structure obtained by Rietveld refinement of the powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. At first, by indexing the observed peaks except for small peaks of impurity phases of Bi2S3 and Bi, we obtained the I-centered tetragonal lattice with lattice parameters of a = 3.9592(1) and c = 41.241(1) Å. The extinction rule suggested that the I4/mmm and I-42m space groups were the candidates. By fitting the XRD pattern with only Bi atoms at the Bi1, Bi2 and Bi3 sites in Table 1, the reliability factor of Rwp = 26.5 % was obtained. Furthermore, by adding S atoms at the S1, S2 and S3 sites in Table 1 to the refinement, Rwp = 16.0 % was achieved. Since both models for these space groups are completely identical, we selected higher-symmetric I4/mmm. Because it is difficult to determine the O sites using only XRD data, we performed structural optimization using DFT calculations. Additionally, we have confirmed the structural stability using molecular dynamics simulation. The atomic positions of Bi and S, determined by the XRD pattern, were only stable when the SO4 ions occupied z = 0 and 0.5. By using the structural model, we performed Rietveld refinement. Figure 2a shows the XRD pattern of this sample and the result of Rietveld refinement (Rwp = 14.41 %). The obtained atomic parameters and the site occupancy are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2b, the XRD pattern is well-fitted at high angle region. A schematic image of the final crystal structure is shown in Fig. 2c. The layered structure is composed of Bi2S4 layers, Bi2O2 layers and SO4. The fluorite-type Bi2O2 layer is one of the well-known layers in the I4/mmm or P4/nmm tetragonal layered structures. In fact, Bi2O2SO4 is a known compound. The rock-salt-type Bi2S4 layer structure has been found only in ReOBiS2 (Re = Ce, Gd and Dy) with the P4/nmm space group.19 Figure 2d is a schematic image of the Bi2S4 layer projected along the c axis. The Bi and S atoms form square lattices. When all the sites are fully occupied, the atomic composition should be Bi6O8S5, namely Bi6O4S4(SO4). If the occupancy of the SO4 site is 50 %, the composition is Bi4O4S3. Therefore, we speculate that there are defects at the SO4 site in our Bi4O4S3 superconducting sample, because defects of molecules or ions at the interlayer site are often observed in layered compounds. Finally, we discuss the band structure of the present material. It is found that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is metallic while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0) is band insulator with Bi3+. Figure 3 shows the band structure for x = 0.5 (Bi4O4S3) obtained using the Wien2k package adopting the lattice structure obtained as above.20 The Fermi level lies within the bands which mainly originate from the Bi 6p orbitals. In particular, the Fermi level is just on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital within the BiS2 layer. Focusing on the contribution from the BiS2 layer, it is found that the band structure near the Fermi level consists of px and py orbital contributions, which in itself have quasi-one-dimensional nature, but mixes around the R point to result in a two dimensional band structure. The width of these Bi p bands is about 3eV, which is comparable to the width of the 3d bands of the high-Tc cuprates or the iron-based superconductors, and this, along with the low dimensional nature of the band structure suggests that electron correlation effects may be playing some role in the occurrence of superconductivity. As reported here, superconductivity in the new layered superconductor Bi4O4S3 is realized within the BiS2 layers upon electron doping. By changing the spacer layers, we will be able to obtain various BiS2-based new superconductors. We believe that the BiS2-based family will open a new field in physics and chemistry for low-dimensional superconductors as have cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. Methods Polycrystalline samples of Bi4O4S3 were prepared using a conventional solid state reaction method. All the chemicals were purchased from Kojundo Chemical Lab. At first, Bi2S3 was prepared by reacting Bi (99.99% grain) and S (99.9% grain) in an evacuated quartz tube above 500 ºC. Starting materials of Bi2S3, Bi2O3 (99.9% powder) and S were ground, pelletized, sealed into an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 510 ºC for 10 h. The product was well-ground, pelletized and annealed at 510 ºC for 10 h in an evacuated quartz tube again. In the case that the Bi4O4S3 sample was heated above 550 ºC, SO2 gas was produced. If you try to synthesize this material, please be careful not to heat the sample sealed in an evacuated tube at high temperature to avoid explosion. Temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility from 10 to 2 K after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and fieled cooling (FC) was measured using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied magnetic field of 9.3 Oe. Temperature dependence of resistivity from 300 to 2 K was measured using the four terminals method. The Tc onset was defined to be a temperature where the resistivity deviates from the linear-extrapolation of normal-state resistivity as shown in the inset of fig. 1b. X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern was collected by RIGAKU x-ray diffractometer with Cu-K radiation using the 2- method. The diffraction peaks were indexed by the software X-Cell21 of Accelrys, Inc. The initial model of the crystal structure was derived from the software TOPAS of Bruker AXS, Inc. The structure was refined by the Rietveld-analysis program Materials Studio Reflex of Accelrys, Inc. Geometry optimizations were carried out using the density functional theory (DFT) methods with the program Materials Studio CASTEP22 of Accelrys, Inc. The GGA (generalized gradient approximation)-PBEsol (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof for solids) exchange-correlation functionals23 and ultrasoft pseudopotentials24 were employed. The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set was 380.0 eV. The Monkhorst-Pack grid separation25 was set to approximately 0.04 Å-1. The lattice parameters were set to the experimental values, and the atomic positions were optimized to minimize the total energy. The schematic images of the crystal structure were depicted using VESTA.26 Band structure of Bi4O4S3 shown in Fig.3 was calculated using the WIEN2k package.20 GGA-PBEsol exchange-correlation functional was adopted.23 512 k-points and RKmax = 7.0 were taken. The spin-orbit interaction was omitted.",inline_phrase,To summarize,"7

True,"Here we discuss the requirements of the evolution of bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2. The F-concentration dependence of structural properties indicates that the O/F solubility limit seems to be near x = 0.5. A superconducting transition is observed for x (nominal) ≥ 0.5. However the shielding volume fraction in the magnetic susceptibility measurement is only 13.4 % for the best sample of x = 0.5 (AP2), which implies that the electron doping level is in the under-doped region of this system. Therefore, we performed the high pressure annealing to achieve further doping of F. Figure 5 shows the XRD profiles near the (102) and (004) peaks. The (004) peak slightly shifts to higher angles after high pressure annealing, indicating that the c axis decreases. This change indicates that the F concentration increased by the high pressure annealing. As described in 3-1, the x = 0.5 (AP2) sample contains small amount of BiF3 and LaF3. The F ions would be supplied from the impurity fluorides. With the fact that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by a slight increase of F concentration from x = 0.5, we guess the optimal doping level is slightly above x = 0.5. The estimated optimal doping level is comparable to that of Bi4O4S3. Therefore, we will be able to achieve bulk superconductivity in LaO1-xFxBiS2 by optimizing the carrier doping techniques or modifying the optimal doping level (band structure) by changing the spacer layer structures. In conclusion, we have discovered a new type of BiS2-based superconductor LaO1-xFxBiS2 with a Tc as high as 10.6 K. This superconductor has a layered structure analogous to the BiS2-based Bi4O4S3 superconductor, suggesting that the BiS2 layer is a basic structure which provides new layered superconducting family like CuO2 plane of cuprates and Fe2An2 layers of Fe-based family. Furthermore, we note that the spacer layer of LaOBiS2 is almost the same as that of LaOFeAs, which is the first FeAs-based system. Thus, we will be able to discover many BiS2-based superconductors on the basis of the analogy to FeAs-based compounds. We expect that the novel superconductors with the BiS2 superconducting layers will open a new field in physics and chemistry of low-dimensional superconductors.",section_header_strict,4.

The curve marked with Hc2 (cross) marks the upper critical field determined using the usual crossing point of the normal state background and the extrapolated line of the steep resistive transition part.

The bulk superconductivity is established in a very small area covered by the irreversibility line Hirr(T) (blue down triangles). The large area between them indicates a strong superconducting phase fluctuation. This is actually consistent with the theoretical expectation because the electronic system has an one dimensional feature. The curve marked with H2c (cross) gives the upper critical field determined using the usual crossing point of the normal state background and the extrapolated line of the steep resistive transition part. The most puzzling point is the kink appearing in the ρ vs. T data at a high magnetic field. The curve marked with Hc(kink) shows the critical field determined from the kinky point of the resistive data shown in Fig. 1(d), by following the trace of the arrowed red line there. Since this line traces very well to the onset transition point marked by Hc2(99%ρn) in the low field region, we naturally attribute it to the existence of residual Cooper pairs. If this kink can be interpreted as the onset for the pairing, that would indicate a very strong pairing strength. In a simple BCS argument, we have Hc2 = (πΦ0)/2¯hv2 F )∆2 sc, where Φ0 is the flux quanta, vF is the Fermi velocity. Such a strong pairing needs certainly a reasonable cause, which exceeds the limit of the simple phonon mediated picture. Taking account of the weak correlation effect in the Bi 6p electrons, some other novel mechanism, such as the valence fluctuation of the Bi2+ and Bi3+, may play an important role in this new superconductor. In summary, resistivity, Hall effect and magnetization have been intensively investigated on the new superconductor Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating behavior is induced in the normal state when a high magnetic field is applied. This can be induced either by an adjacent competing order, or the very shallow px and py band and small Fermi energy. Both the strong non-linear Hall effect and the magnetoresistance indicate the multiband feature. A kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity at all high magnetic fields when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed. This kink can be well traced back to the upper critical field Hc2(T ) in the low field region. We argue that the superconducting pairing, for some reason, could be very strong and occur first in the one dimensional chains, then the bulk superconductivity is established through the Josephson coupling between them.",inline_phrase,Finally,We appreciate,3568,591,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1207.4955v1_full.txt,1207.4955v1_full.txt,
True,"the BiS2-based superconductor NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.1 - 0.7) has been successfully synthesized by a solid-state reaction method. Chemical pressure promotes the F substitution, which originated from the exchange of La by Nd. As a result, NdO1-xFxBiS2 with bulk superconductivity can be obtained under ambient pressure. These results demonstrate that the BiS2 layer is the common superconducting layer. Thus, if we synthesize materials with the stacking structure consisting of the BiS2 layer and other blocking layers, new superconductors with the BiS2-layer would be discovered.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",Acknowledgements,576,84,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1207.5248v1_full.txt,1207.5248v1_full.txt,
True,"polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 were obtained. The room-temperature crystal structure and lattice constants were determined by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Philips X'pert PRO) with Cu Kα radiation. The electronic and thermal transport measurements were performed in a Quantum Design physical property measurement system (PPMS), and the magnetization measurement was performed on a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) system. Figure 1 shows the XRD pattern for the Bi4O4S3 polycrystalline. The Bragg diffractions can be indexed using the tetragonal structure with the space group of I4/mmm. The lattice parameters are obtained by fitting the powder XRD pattern by using the Rietica software,11 and the obtained lattice constants a, b and c are a=b=0.3978nm, c= 4.107nm, respectively, which are in consistence with the reported results.9 Figure 2 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of the Bi4O4S3 polycrystalline measured by a standard four-probe method under a zero magnetic field. As seen from Fig. 2, the Bi4O4S3 has a metallic behavior in the normal state, and the magnitude of the resistivity is slightly less than that reported in Ref. 9 in the whole measurement temperature region. When the sample was cooled down to 5 K, the resistivity has an abrupt drop due to the occurrence of superconductivity. The inset of Fig. 2 shows the low temperature resistivity of Bi4O4S3 at different applied magnetic field (H). The superconducting transition temperature (Tc onset) and zero resistivity temperature (Tc0) of the sample are determined to be 4.5 K and 4.02 K at H=0T, respectively, and the superconducting transition width is determined to be 0.3 K according to 10-90% of the normal state resistivity, such a narrow width indicates the homogeneity of the sample. The Tc onset and Tc0 shift to lower temperatures with the increase of H. The superconductivity was also proved by the magnetic measurements shown in Fig. 3. The diamagnetism in the low-temperature region further confirms the existence of superconductivity, and the steep transition in the M (T) curve indicates that the sample is rather homogeneous. The superconducting diamagnetic transition begins at 4.02 K, defined by the onset point of the zero-field-cooling (ZFC) and field-cooling (FC) curves. It is consistent with the Tc0 obtained from the resistance measurement. The smaller magnetization value for FC is likely due to the complicated magnetic flux pinning effects.12 The value of -4πχ at 2 K is about 33%. The top inset of Fig. 3 shows the magnetization hysteresis loop of Bi4O4S3 at T=2K. The shape of the M (H) curve indicates that Bi4O4S3 is a typical type-II superconductor. The bottom inset of Fig. 3 shows the initial M (H) curves of the Bi4O4S3 in the low-field region at K, which allows us to estimate the lower critical field values (Hc1) at 2 K. At low fields, the M (H) isotherm is linear with H, as expected for a BCS type-II superconductor. The estimated Hc1 (2 K) value is about 7.4 Oe, defined by the point where the curve deviates from linearity (marked by the arrow in the inset of Fig.3). The thermal transport measurement results which are containing the Seebeck coefficient (S), electrical resistivity ρ, thermal conductivity κ are shown in Fig. 4. The k (T) shows a broad peak at around 25K. The origin is unknown at present. The S (T) is negative in the whole measurement temperature region, indicating the major carriers are electron-like. It is in agreement with the Hall measurement results.10 The S (T) is linearly dependent with temperature when T is less than 50K, above which the S (T) is less temperature dependent. It results in a broad slope change at ~ 100K. In the similar temperature region, a broad minimum in the Hall coefficient RH(T) was observed.10 It indicates the temperature dependence of S (T) is mainly governed by the evolution of charge carrier density with temperature. The efficiency of a thermoelectric material is determined by the dimensionless figure of merit, ZT (ZT=S2T/ρκ). Hence, a good thermoelectric material should have high S, low κ and ρ. The dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) for Bi4O4S3 is presented in Fig. 4(b). Due to low resistivity, and relatively small thermal conductivity, the ZT value of our sample at 300K reaches about 0.03. The ZT value at 300K is comparable to the Fe-based superconductors LaFePO1-xFx and LaFeAsO1-xFx,13 while larger than cuprates HgBaCaCuO (1223) and BiSrCaCuO (2212)14 by a few magnitudes. It is interesting to modify the S (T), κ (T) and ρ (T) to increase the ZT value so as to meet the requirements of practical applications, for instance, via chemical doping. In summary, polycrystalline samples of the new layered superconductor Bi4O4S3 are prepared by a one-step solid-state reaction method using Bi, S and Bi2O3 powders. The electronic and magnetic measurements show that the onset transition temperature and zero resistance transition temperature are Tc onset=4.5 K and Tc0=4.02 K, respectively. Our M (H) measurement indicates Bi4O4S3 is a typical type II-superconductor.

True,"we have measured the electrical resistivity under pressure for the BiS2 based layered superconductors Bi4O4S3 and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Tc in metallic Bi4O4S3 decreases monotonically with increasing pressure, whereas Tc in semiconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 initially increases and then decreases upon approaching the metallic region. The strong suppression of the semiconducting behavior in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 suggests that the Fermi surface is in the vicinity of some instability. It is plausible that the Fermi level is located near the edge of the conduction band. This indicates that superconductivity is realized in the complex Fermi surface including the impurity band with a low carrier density and a low density of states, and it rather provides benefit for achieving a higher Tc.",inline_phrase,"In summary,",Acknowledgement,774,114,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1207.6935v2_full.txt,1207.6935v2_full.txt,

True,"In summary, we carried out magnetic susceptibility and electrical resistivity measurements as well as electron microprobe analysis on Bi4O4S3, which has recently been claimed to be a bulk superconductor (Tc = 4.5 K). Quality-improved polycrystalline Bi4O4S3 was successfully prepared by an HP method, and the lattice parameters and normal-state ρ, as well as the density of states at the Fermi level, were found to be comparable to those determined previously. The most notable discovery in this study was the impurity-driven SC (>1.6 K) in Bi4O4S3, which contradicted the results of ongoing studies of this compound. There are two possible reasons for the above-mentioned discrepancy: (i) common technical errors, including those related to the presence of a superconducting impurity, in ongoing studies. The impurity was found to show zero resistivity, even though its superconducting shielding fraction was smaller than 0.3%; (ii) slight local structure and chemical composition differences between the HP phase and the superconducting phase of Bi4O4S3, including a small variation of the S1-Bi2 bond in the BiS2 layer, as detected in this study. The concentrations of vacancies of the SO4 group in the layered structure of Bi4O4S3 might also vary upon HP heating. If the latter is true, the HP phase can be a host material for the superconducting phase. Although we cannot discuss the possible structure or composition variations of Bi4O4S3 in more detail because neutron diffraction studies are required, we conclude that the SC of the HP-prepared Bi4O4S3 is most likely impurity-driven. The relative sample scale to the λL hardly accounted for the negligible superconducting shielding fraction, as evidenced by the magnetic susceptibility measurements at a magnetic field of 1 Oe as well as of 10 Oe on a mm-size HP sample. Hence, the full shielding fraction reported in ongoing studies1-3) was possibly complicated by a superconducting link consisting of similar superconducting impurities throughout the grain boundaries and at the surface in a synthesized pellet as evidenced by marked decreases in the shielding fraction at a magnetic field of Oe (<< Hc1) even upon gentle grinding. Although the various forms of the superconducting link could play a fundamental role in the observed SC, it was highly challenging to identify the chemical composition and structure of the superconducting impurities because partially melted phases can be essential in the formation of the superconducting link (Bi melting point: 272 °C and S melting point: 115.2 °C). Although the Bi powder treated in the same heating procedure as the reference was not superconducting above 2 K, multiple phases were superconducting at the highest Tc of 8.2 K.10) Thus, neighbor materials in solid and amorphous forms should be carefully studied for relevance to the observed SC. In addition, the surface of the BiS2 layered phase might be altered under the presence of liquid phases during the heating process, resulting in the appearance of possible surface superconductivity. No matter which, the observed superconductivity did not truly reflect the bulk nature of the BiS2 layered phase, regardless of the manner in which the Bi4O4S3 compound is synthesized. Since the difficulty in identifying the superconducting impurities complicates ongoing studies, further experimental efforts toward measuring the degree of impact from impurities and possible altered particle surfaces on the observed SC would be needed to correctly characterize the BiS2 layered phase.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"We have synthesized novel BiS2-based superconductors LaO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0 ~ 0.7 using solid-state reaction and high-pressure post annealing. As compared to the LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples prepared using only solid-state reaction, the lattice constants of the high-pressure samples were smaller. Superconducting transition was observed for x = 0.2 ~ 0.7, and the optimal superconducting properties were obtained for x = 0.5 with the Tc onset exceeding 10 K. The phase diagram showed an x-dependent superconducting dome. The evolution of dome-shaped dependence resembled the x dependence of the a axis. This may indicate that the correlation between the Tc and the a axis is essential for BiS2-based superconductivity.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"In this review, we introduced the crystal structure and physical properties of remarkable layered chalcogenide superconductors. Chalcogenides tend to crystallize in a layered structure; hence, the intercalations/deintercalations of ions or molecules at the interlayer site dramatically changes the physical properties and induces exotic superconductivity. The most remarkable family is the Fe chalcogenides, which is the simplest Fe-based superconductor. In this series, the key factors to induce superconductivity are the suppression of antiferromagnetism of Fe planes and the reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe at the interlayer site. The later, reduction of magnetic moment of excess Fe can be achieved by oxygen intercalation via annealing in oxygen condition or deintercalation of excess Fe via annealing in acid. Interestingly, red wine is the most effective than any other solution. At the end, we introduced the newly discovered BiS2-based superconducting family. The BiS2 layer is likely to play an important role of the superconductivity, as CuO2 plane of cuprates and FeAn (FeAs, FeP, FeSe or FeTe) layers of Fe-based superconductors. We will be able to create new BiS2-based superconductors with various blocking layers. We believe that unidentified exotic chalcogenide superconductors other than the families introduced here exist and are waiting to be discovered in near future.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"the present first-principles calculations indicate that LaO1-xFxBiS2 changes from a band insulator at x = 0 to a band metal upon doping. Similar to LaFeAsO1-xFx, electrons in LaO1-xFxBiS2 are doped from the LaO(F) redox layer to the superconducting BiS2 layers. The p-orbital states of Bi-S1 layers play an important role in the electron transformation due to their domination of the DOS at the Fermi level. From the phonon calculations for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we obtain a strong electron-phonon coupling of λ = 0.8 and a superconducting transition temperature of Tc = 9.1 K, the latter being very close to its experimental value. It then follows that LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 is a conventional electron-phonon superconductor. For LaO1-xFxBiS2, we have shown that the electronic states near the Fermi level are dominantly from the hybridized p orbital states of the Bi and S1 atoms, and the electron-phonon coupling comes mainly from the contribution of the Bi and S phonons. These facts indicate that the BiS2 layers play an important role in the transport and superconducting properties, similar to the CuO2 layers of the cuprates or Fe-As layers of the Fe-based superconductors.",inline_phrase,"In summary,","I.

True,"we suggest that the origin of the anharmonic ferroelectric mode could be due to mismatch between the optimum lattice parameters of the LaO and the BiS2 layers. If the Bi-S bond is forced to elongate due to interaction between LaO and BiS2 planes, then it is natural for the S atom to break the symmetry and move towards the Bi atom to optimize Bi-S interaction. In fact, repeating the phonon calculations for smaller lattice parameters (i. e. a=b=3.8, corresponding to 100 kbar pressure), we do not get negative phonon energies at the zone center any more. Hence, it seems that by changing the spacer oxide, one may tune the nature of the soft phonons and the ground state structure. Figure 4b shows the total energy in the √ 2× √ cell of the tetragonal structure for x = 0.5 as it is distorted by the most negative energy phonon mode at (π, π). Unlike the parent compound, the distortion lowers the system energy significantly, causing S atoms move away by 0.16 ˚A from the high symmetry site. Solving the Schrodinger equation for the resulting potential curve numerically, we obtained the energy levels which are bound to the FIG. 5: (color online) 1D Charge Denity Wave formation. The BiS2 plane in fully optimized CDW phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. Large pink and small yellow spheres are Bi and S, respectively. Dashed red line is to guide the eye, indicating the sinusoidal distortion of the atoms. The white square indicates the 2 √ × √ unit cell of the CDW phase. Bottom panel shows the same structure with a Bi-S bond cutoffdistance of 2.8 ˚A. The one dimensional nature of the chains becomes apparent. The intra-chain Bi-S bond is about 2.75 ˚A while inter-chain Bi-S bond is around 3 ˚A (see Fig. S3). local minimum of the distortion. The blue-dashed line in Fig. 4b shows that the same distortion also occurs for the charged system without F-doping. Hence, the observed soft-mode is an intrinsic property of the BiS2 plane. We next checked whether the (π, π) phonon optimized √ × √ structure is stable at other q-vectors by repeating the phonon calculations using a 2 √ × 2 √ super-cell. We obtained more negative energy modes that correspond to the original instability at the (π/2, π/2) of the 4 × 4 × 1 tetragonal supercell calculations. Hence, we further distorted the 2 √ × 2 √ structure by the (π/2, π/2) negative energy phonon and let the system relax. We determined that the optimized structure has the √ × 2 √ unit cell with a rather interesting rearrangement of Bi and S atoms in the BiS2 plane, as shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. S4. We call this distorted structure as CDW phase, due to the sinusoidal distortion of the Bi and S atoms as shown by red dashed lines in Figure 5. Unlike the x = 0 case, applying pressure or using smaller lattice constants in the phonon calculations does not stabilize the negative energy phonons. Hence, it is tempting to conclude that the origin of this distortion is due to strong Fermi surface nesting at M[11, 12]. However, we note that the soft phonon branch occurs along the entire line Q = (q, q, 0) and not just at the M point. Hence, in addition to Fermi surface nesting, there should be an important structural reason as well for the observed soft modes. Finally, by looking at the bond distances between Bi-S, we notice that there are one-dimensional channels of Bi-S bonding as shown in Fig. 5. Interestingly, from Hall Effect measurements14 it was concluded that superconducting pairing occurs in one-dimensional chains in these systems, which could be related to the CDW phase predicted here. Similarly, high pressure measurements reveal non-monotonic dependence of Tc on pressure and suggest that the Fermi surface of LaOxF1-xBiS2 could be in the vicinity of instabilities[10]. Finally, the x-ray powder diffraction[6] for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 shows rather unusual broad peaks, which could be again related to the CDW phase. We next address the nature of superconductivity found in these BiS2 layered systems. We carried out el-ph coupling calculations using both (π, π) phonon optimized √ × √ and CDW structures. We consider 2 √ × 2 √ supercells, containing 80 atoms and obtain the el-ph coupling by the frozen-phonon method. The results are summarized in Figure 6. In both (π, π)-optimized or fully distorted CDW structures, the Eliashberg functions are quite similar, indicating that the main physics of the electron-phonon coupling mechanism does not depend on the details of the structure. In the (π, π)-phonon optimized structure, N(EF ) is higher than in the CDW phase, and therefore leads to higher el-ph coupling. The total electron-phonon coupling is λ = 0.83 with a logarithmic frequency average ωlog = 101K. These values give a maximum superconducting temperature of Tc = 8.5 K. Even in the fully distorted CDW phase, we get quite large electron-phonon coupling λ = 0.6 and a logarithmic frequency average ωlog = 122 K, which gives a Tc of 6 K. These values are in excellent agreement with the reported experimental values of Tc which vary from 3K to K, depending on the level of doping and sample quality. Inspecting the modes which give the highest el-ph coupling, we estimate that about 90% of λ comes from in-plane Bi and S phonons while the remaining 10% is due to phonons along the c-axis. There are two bands of phonons near (5 to 10) meV and (15 to 25) meV. The phonons in the lower energy band are due to coupled Bi and S motion while the phonons in the high energy bands are due to almost pure S oscillations. Animation of these modes can be found in Ref.24. In Figure 6, we also show the total phonon density of states along with the atomicprojections of the DOS. As expected based on the masses of atoms, O and F-based phonons are above 30 meV and do not producing much el-ph coupling. The La phonons are near 10 meV but, as expected, do not produce any significant el-ph coupling. In conclusion, we have discovered rather unusual structural and dynamical properties of LaOBiS2 with electron doping. The large-amplitude in-plane S-atom displacement controls the structural properties and gives rise to large el-ph coupling.

Our results also suggest that thin films of BiS2 on various substrates may exhibit unusual properties due to epitaxial strain at the interface. New materials with similar structures but with BiO2 plane could be quite interesting due to smaller mass of oxygen atom, which gives higher phonon energies, and in turn higher Tc. In fact, the results reported here remind us of another interesting system, namely Ba1-xKxBiO3[25], which exhibits several complicated structural phases[26] and superconductivity at 31 K[25]. It is too early to say which of these predictions from DFT calculations will be demonstrated experimentally. However it is clear that the BiS2 based layered systems are very rich in physics, involving nearly ferroelectric soft phonons and CDW ordering along with strongly coupled electron-phonon superconductivity.",inline_phrase,"Finally,",Acknowledgments:,7538,1286,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1210.2418v1_full.txt,1210.2418v1_full.txt,
True,"let us discuss the Fermi surface for the superconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and the evolution of its topology depending on the doping level. For LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, the Fermi surface adopts a 2D-like topology (which is typical of layered SCs, reviews [1-7]) and comprises a set of disconnected cylinders extended along the kz direction, Fig. 1. Two of them are along the Г-Z direction, the other two are in the corners of the BZ (along the MA direction), and the rest two small cylinder-like sheets are on the lateral faces of the BZ (along the X-R direction). Next, in Fig. 5 we present a set of FSs for LaO1-xFxBiS2 across the doping level. We see that in all the cases the FSs retain the quasi-two-dimensional type, but their shapes change essentially depending on the band occupancy (doping level). So at an initial stage of doping (x=0.2), the FS contains only two electron-like sheets in the BZ lateral sides. With an increase in the band occupancy, the volume of the Fermi surface gradually increases, but the shape is retained (x=0.3). Visible reconstruction of the FS occurs for x ~ 0.4, when the disconnected sheets on the lateral sides of the BZ became merged, and new small sheets (along X-R) appear. At the highest doping level (x ≥ 0.5), the next stage of reconstruction occurs, when the FS adopts the form described earlier for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. In summary, using first-principles calculations we examined the electronic band structure and the Fermi surface for the very recently discovered superconductor LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 in comparison with the parent band insulator LaOBiS2 and determined the key electronic factors promoting the superconducting transition for the fluorine-doped LaOBiS2 and the TC dependence on x for LaO1-xFxBiS2. According to our data, the main factors at fluorine doping are: (i) the increase of the charge transfer between adjacent blocks [LnO]→[BiS2] related to metallization of superconducting blocks [BiS2]; (ii) the dome-shaped dependence of Ntot(EF) on x related to the regulation of the values of TC, and (iii) the reconstruction of the 2D-like Fermi surface, which is related to the nesting effect.",inline_phrase,"Finally,","5

True,"Summarizing, a weak-coupling RPA analysis of a minimal 2-orbital model was used to investigate the pairing properties of the BiS2-based superconductors. Fillings between 0.46 and 1.0 were analyzed. The Hund's coupling was varied in the range 0.1 ≤J/U ≤0.4. Qualitatively, the results are similar for all values of J/U and different fillings. In the RPA results described here, a clear relationship is found between quasi FS nesting, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity: the topology of the two hole-pockets is such that they present almost parallel segments close to the (π/2, π/2) wavevector in the BZ. It is found that the horizontal distance (kn, 0) between the tangents to these segments at the points where they cross the Σ line is also where the noninteracting susceptibility χ0 has a pronounced peak at (kn, 0), for 0.46 ≤n ≤1.0. Once interactions are introduced, this peak will diverge at a certain critical coupling U for each filling, and all the values of J/U studied (with exception of one: n = 0.5, J/U = 0.1). In addition, a line of local maxima, connecting the BZ points (kn, 0) and (0, kn), is clearly observed in a 2-d plot of χ0. As expected, this line can also be associated to FS nesting. This nesting structure gives origin to pairing functions with similar eigenvalues, i. e., similar pairing strengths, and symmetries B2g and A1g. This close competition originates in the FS quasi nesting properties, which determine the spin-fluctuation-mediated inter-pocket pair scattering. This pair scattering is overwhelmingly between two adjacent FS segments, therefore the properties of the pairing functions, including the pairing strength, are quite ""local"", having almost no dependence on their global symmetry. One can then predict that pairing symmetry measurements may contain a mixture of both symmetries if the pairing mechanism is driven by spin fluctuations.",section_header_strict,Conclusions.,GBM acknowledges,1887,300,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1212.0210v1_full.txt,1212.0210v1_full.txt,
True,"the specific heat data show evidence of strong-coupling nature of the observed superconductivity. The polycrystalline samples of Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 (x = 0, 0.5) used in this study were synthesized by two-step solid state reaction method. The starting materials, La pieces, SrF2 powder, Bi and S powder are all of high purity (≥99.9%). Firstly, La2S3 was pre-synthesized by reacting stoichiometric S powder and La pieces at 873 K for 10 hours. After that, the as-grown La2S3 and the powder of SrS, SrF2, Bi, and S as starting material were weighted according to their stoichiometric ratio and then fully ground in an agate mortar. The mixture of powder was then pressed into pellets, heated in an evacuated quartz tube at 1073 K for 10 hours and finally furnacecooled to room temperature. The whole process was repeated once again in order to get the pure phase. Crystal structure characterization was performed by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperature using a D/Max-rA diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation and a graphite monochromator. Lattice parameters were obtained by Rietveld refinements. The electrical resistiv2 ity was measured with a standard four-terminal method covering temperature range from 0.4 to 300 K in a commercial Quantum Design PPMS-9 system with a 3He refrigeration insert. Specific heat and Hall effect measurements were also performed in this system.

The solid line indicates the unit cell. Figure 1 (a) shows the powder XRD patterns of the Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 (x=0, 0.5) samples. Overall, the main diffraction peaks of these two samples can be well indexed based on a tetragonal cell structure with the P4/nmm space group. Extra minor peaks arising from impurity phase of Bi2S3 can also be seen. The content of impurity phase Bi2S3 estimated by Rietveld fitting is about 15% and 12% for parent compound(x = 0) and x = 0.5 sample, respectively. The lattice parameters of the parent compound SrFBiS2 are extracted to be a = 4.0820˚A and c = 13.8025˚A by Rietveld fitting, in good agreement with the previous report.11 For the La-doped sample, however, the (00l) peaks shift discernibly towards higher 2θ angles, suggesting the smaller c-axis constant. Thus, while the a-axis lattice parameter increases slightly to 4.0822˚A in the La-doped sample, the c-axis decreases significantly to 13.335˚A, implying that the La impurity was indeed doped into the lattice, given that the ionic radius of La ion is known to be smaller than that of Sr. This is quite similar to the case of LaO1-xFxBiS2.4 The resultant crystal structure is therefore schematically shown in the Fig.1(b), which is composed of stacked rock-salt-type BiS2 layer alternating with fluorite-type SrF layer along the c-axis. The zero-field temperature dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ) of these two samples is plotted in Fig. 2(a). For the parent SrFBiS2 compound, the resistivity clearly shows thermally activated behavior with decreasing temperature from 300 K, and no resistivity anomaly can be observed down to 2 K. The thermal activation energy (Ea) obtained by fitting with the thermal activation formula ρ(T ) = ρ0 exp(Ea/kBT ) for the temperature range from 100 K to 300 K is about 38.2 meV, consistent with previous studies.11 However, it is noted that its absolute value is nearly two thirds smaller than the reported value by Lei et al.11 We attribute this to the impurity phase of Bi2S3 with sulfur deficiency12 in our sample which may decrease the absolute value of resistivity. As Sr is partially replaced by La (x = 0.5), the resistivity remains semiconducting-like at high temperatures, with the magnitude of resistivity substantially reduced compared to the undoped sample. Meanwhile, the Ea fitted at high temperature also decreases to 8.6 meV, suggesting the decrease of gap size because of electron doping. With further cooling down, a sharp superconducting transition with Tc of 2.8 K is clearly seen. This result is reminiscent of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, where the normal state shows semiconducting behavior, and it undergoes superconducting transition below K.2 Interestingly, the first principles calculations7 has suggested that there may be a charge density wave instability or an enhanced correlation effect in this system. Yet, no such instability can be detected merely from the resistivity measurement given in this study. Figure 2 (b) shows the close-up view of the lowtemperature resistivity for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 samples under various magnetic fields below 4 K. The inset gives the temperature dependence of the upper critical field µ0Hc2(T ), determined by using 90% normal state resistivity criterion. The temperature dependence of µ0Hc2(T ) is nearly linear in the temperature range studied. According to Ginzburg-Landau theory, the upper critical field Hc2 evolves with temperature following the formula: Hc2(T ) = Hc2(0)(1 -t2)/(1 + t2), (1) where t is the renormalized temperature T/Tc. It is found that the upper critical field Hc2 as drawn can be well fitted by this model and its zero temperature limit is estimated to be 1.04 T. In order to verify the bulk nature of the observed superconductivity, the temperature dependence of d. c. magnetic susceptibility was measured under 5 Oe magnetic field with both zero field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) modes for the superconducting samples. The strong diamagnetic signal was observed for Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample. The Tc value determined from the magnetic susceptibility agrees well with the one extracted from the resistivity data. The estimated volume fraction of magnetic shielding from ZFC data is over 30%, bearing out the bulk superconductivity. Note that the Meissner volume fraction estimated by FC measurement data also exceeds 20%, indicating the high quality superconducting sample. To further study its superconducting properties, the specific heat measurement of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 sample was performed in the temperature range from 0.5 K to 5 K. As plotted in Fig. 4, a clear specific-heat jump can be observed at Tc = 2.8 K, further confirming the bulk su3 100 300 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 x = 0 m cm T (K) Sr 1-x La x FBiS x = 0.5 (a) 1 3 5 10 30 1 3 0.0 0.3 0.6 0.9 T (K) Sr 0.5 La 0.5 FBiS 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.05 m cm T (K) B = 0 T (b) FIG. 2.

Below 1.5 K, however, the low temperature heat capacity undergoes a moderate upturn which very likely arises from Schottky anomaly associated with the impurities phase or the freezing out of La nuclear spins.13 Taking into account the Schottky anomaly component, the overall specific heat can be written as: C/T = γ + βT 2 + α/T 3 (2) where γ and βT 2 account for the electronic and lattice contributions respectively, and the last term, α/T 3, is the Schottky anomaly. The plot of C/T-α/T 3 versus T 2 shows a linear behavior in the high temperature range from 2.9 to 5 K (data not explicitly shown here). The resultant electronic coefficient γ and the lattice coefficient β are 1.42 mJ/ mol K2 and β = 0.414 mJ/ mol K4 respectively. The Debye temperature is then estimated to be 265 K. This value is somewhat smaller that those of LaONiAs,14 LaOFeP15 and LaO0.89F0.11FeAs.16 The lattice contribution was further subtracted in the inset in 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0.0 T (K) ZFC FC H = 5 Oe Sr 0.5 La 0.5 FBiS FIG. 3.

The corresponding electronic specific jump at Tc, therefore, is estimated to be ∆Ce/γTc = 1.4, very close to the weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) value of 1.43. Considering the relatively low volume fraction of magnetic shielding suggested from susceptibility measurement, the real size of ∆Ce/γTc ought to be much larger than the BCS value, implying that SC in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 likely involves a strong electron-phonon coupling, consistent with the theoretical prediction.7 1 3 5 5 15 25 1 3 5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 T (K) C e / T C/T (m J.

The result reminds us of the similar behavior observed in iron-based SC, where RH decreases sharply due to spin density wave(SDW) formation.18 In the present sample, however, no SDW/CDW anomaly has been observed in the measurements of resistivity and magnetization. On the other hand, it is known that the inherent impurity phase may act to smear out the anomalies in the resistivity and susceptibility. In this regard, it would be interesting to clarify this problem by first principles calculations7 or further improving the sample quality. In a single band metal, the Hall coefficient RH is associated with carrier density (n) as RH = 1/ne. We therefore estimate the charge carrier density to be 1.05×1019/cm3 at 5 K, which is similar to the Bi4O4S3 system17 and iron based superconductors19 with a very low superfluid density. In addition, we can not rule out the multi-band effect,5 as the origin of the drop in RH. In summary, we study the electron doping effect, i. e., partially substituting La for Sr, in the newly discovered SrFBiS2 system. The parent compound shows semiconducting-like resistivity with decreasing temperature. Via electron doping, we discovered a new BiS2based superconductor Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 with a Tc as high as 2.8 K. Importantly, this superconductivity was found to develop on the background of insulating normal state, raising a question of whether this superconductor is in proximity to a Mott insulator or a band insulator. Based on the heat capacity measurement, we speculate that the superconducting electron pairs might have a strongcoupled nature. In this regard, it would certainly be interesting to identify the symmetry of superconducting order parameter in this system along with other BiS2based superconductors.

True,"Next we present a phase diagram based on the transport and STS measurements in Fig. 7 and give discussions on the possible mechanism of superconductivity. The SC transition point of critical field Hc(99%ρn) is shown by the red filled circles. The bulk superconductivity is established in a very small area covered by the irreversibility line Tirr (blue up-triangles). The large area between them indicates a strong SC phase fluctuation.

The most puzzling point is the kink appearing in the ρ vs. T data at a high magnetic field. The curve marked with Hkink c2 shows the critical field determined from the kinky point of the resistive data shown in Fig. 3(c), by following the trace of the arrowed red line there. We add the fluctuation temperature Tf from the tunnelling spectrum at zero magnetic field to the phase diagram, and get a wide fluctuation region at zero magnetic field. Since this line traces very well to the transition point marked by Hc(99%ρn) in the low field and high temperature region, we naturally attribute it to the existence of residual Cooper pairs. If this kink can be interpreted as the onset for the pairing, that would indicate a very strong pairing strength or gap, which can be inversely supported by the tunneling data. In a simple BCS picture, we have Hc2 = (πΦ0/2ℏ2v2 F)∆2, where Φ0 is the flux quanta, vF is the Fermi velocity. Such a strong pairing needs certainly a reasonable cause, which exceeds the limit of the simple phonon mediated pairing picture. By taking account of the weak correlation effect in the Bi 6p electrons, some other novel mechanism, such as the valence fluctuation of the Bi2+ and Bi3+, may play an important role in this new superconductor. IV. CONCLUSIONS In summary, we perform the resistive and scanning tunnelling spectroscopy measurements on the new BiS2 based superconductor Bi4O4S3. A weak insulating behavior is induced in the normal state when a high magnetic field is applied. This can be induced either by an adjacent competing order, or the very shallow px and py band and small Fermi energy. A kink appears on the temperature dependence of resistivity at all high magnetic fields when the bulk superconductivity is completely suppressed. This kink can be regarded as the presence of local pairing, or the upper critical field Hc2(T). The SC fluctuation region from the STS measurement extends to about 14 K although the bulk superconducting transition temperature is only about 3.7 K. The gapped feature near the Fermi energy can also extend to a high magnetic field ( 5 T), which is consistent with the resistive measurements, again indicating a strong superconducting fluctuation. From the tunnelling spectra, a mean superconducting gap of 3 meV is widely observed, which leads to a very high ratio of 2∆/kBTc ≈16.6, suggesting strong coupling superconductivity.",section_header_strict,"III.

We have synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 polycrystalline samples with various annealing conditions up to 3 steps. The HP annealing generates uniaxial strain along the c axis. The generated strain is returned to the initial state of the As-grown sample by annealing the sample in an evacuated quartz tube at 700 ºC. The highest superconducting properties, Tc and shielding fraction, are observed in the HP sample, and the superconducting properties is degraded by reducing the uniaxial strain.

True,"we have carried out the temperature dependence high pressure electrical resistivity measurements up to ~1.8 GPa for BiS2 based Bi4O4S3 and NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 novel layered superconductors. Also, we have investigated the variation of Tc at different applied pressures using four probe techniques. The Tc onset decreases gradually from 4.8 K to 4.3 K in Bi4O4S3 for all the applied pressures (0 to 1.4 GPa) and therefore it holds a negative pressure coefficient of -0.287 K/GPa. Contrarily, the pressure effect on Tc of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 has positive pressure coefficient where the Tc onset increases up to 1.31 GPa at a rate of 0.435 K/GPa and thereafter it reduces for further enhancement of pressure becomes negative coefficient (dTc onset/dP= -0.1714 K/GPa K/GPa) on Tc at high pressure of 1.75 GPa.

True,"We have observed a striking enhancement of superconductivity accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behavior with pressure in the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds (Ln = La, Ce) at critical pressures of ∼1.1 GPa and ∼2.0 GPa for Ln = La and Ce, respectively. There is markedly similar behavior in the electrical resistivity measurements under applied pressure for these two BiS2-based superconductors LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2. Electrical resistivity measurements reveal that for both compounds, the suppression of their semiconducting behavior is hysteretic upon application of pressure. The semiconducting behavior of the electrical resistivity is consistent with two energy gaps that are suppressed with pressure in a similar way. The pressure dependence of the electrical resistivity exhibits hysteresis below a critical pressure where there is a change in slope of log(ρ) vs. P and where the maximum value of Tc is observed. Furthermore, for both compounds, we have discovered a continuous and reversible transient region between regions of low and high Tc, which is characterized by a broadening of the superconducting transition; however, the mechanism behind the broadening of the superconducting transitions between the lower and higher Tc regions is unclear. The broadening could be a simple consequence of the sensitive pressure-dependence of Tc in this region, which, when coupled with even a modest pressure gradient, could result in broader measured superconducting transitions. Sample inhomogeneity might also be responsible for the distribution of transition pressures seen in the broadening region, and the possibility of pressure-induced structural phase transitions is currently being investigated with x-ray diffraction measurements under pressure. Given the striking similarity in behavior for these two BiS2-based superconductors, further electrical resistivity measurements under pressure on other compounds could point to characteristic behavior of BiS2-based superconductors in general. In experiments currently underway we have observed the same qualitative behavior for the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 and PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds as were observed in the the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds suggesting this is indeed a general phenomenon in the class of LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds. Our results on the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound may be compared to the recently reported study of NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 specimens prepared in a solid state reaction by Selvan et al.16 For the compounds with Ln = La, Ce and Pr, there is a dramatic decrease in the electrical resistivity with pressure that reflects a continuous suppression of semiconducting behavior. Although the temperature coefficient of the electrical resistivity, dρ/dT, at the highest pressures is small for these Ln = La, Ce and Pr compounds, the coefficient nevertheless remains negative (dρ/dT < 0), so that we cannot definitely conclude that the metallic state has been achieved. We have, however, been able to reach a metallic state for Ln = Nd, indicated by a positive temperature coefficient of resistivity (dρ/dT > 0), consistent with a semiconductor-metal transition. Experiments to pressures in excess of 3 GPa are currently under way to see if definitive metallic states (i. e., dρ/dT > 0) can be attained for the Ln = La, Ce, and Pr compounds.",section_header_strict,"IV.

In the four compounds, the pressure-induced transition observed in the superconducting state is coincident with changes in the suppression of the electrical resistivity ρ in the normal state. The rate of suppression of semiconducting behaviour (Figure 3(a)) and the rate of decrease in the energy gap ∆1 (Figure 3(b)) both saturate at pressures that correlate with the transition pressure into the high Tc superconducting phase. In the specific case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, a semiconductor-metal transition occurs at Pt. These changes in the normal state electrical resistivity indicate there may be significant increases in the charge carrier density during the rapid increase in Tc that occurs between the two superconducting phases.[17] The transition pressures Pt, indicated by the black arrows in the temperaturepressure phase diagrams of Figure 4(a), were defined as the pressure corresponding to the value of Tc at the midpoint between the values of Tc in the low and high Tc phases immediately preceding and following the transition. Pt is plotted as a function of lanthanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 in Figure 4(b). There is a clear linear relationship between the increasing atomic number of Ln and an increase in Pt. The magnitude of the ""jump"" in Tc also scales with the atomic number of the Ln element in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 as clearly shown in the inset of Figure 4(b). The pressureinduced increase in Tc decreases in magnitude as the atomic number of the lanthanide element increases. The lengths of the vertical bars in Figure 4(b) represent the respective pressure windows over which the transitions from the low Tc phase to the high Tc phase occurred in each of the four compounds. The pressure range over which the transition occurs also decreases with increasing atomic number of Ln in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2. Table 1 contains values of low Tc, maximum Tc, overall increase in Tc (max. Tc - low Tc), and transition pressure Pt, for each compound. The evolution of Tc with pressure in the low Tc phase has recently been reported for the LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd) compounds in two studies by Selvan et al.[15, 16] Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors For PrO0.5F0.5BiS2, they observed a gradual increase of Tc from 3.7 to 4.7 K with pressure up to ∼2.2 GPa.[16] For NdO0.5F0.5BiS2, they found a gradual evolution of Tc with pressure from 4.6 to 5.0 K up to a pressure of ∼1.3 GPa and then down from 5.0 to 4.8 K upon further application of pressure up to ∼1.8 GPa.[15] In both reports, however, there was no evidence of a transition characterized by a rapid increase in Tc. It is possible that slight variations in the chemical composition of the samples in their studies compared to those studied by us may be responsible for differences in the material's response to applied pressure. Furthermore, the pressure transmitting media used in this study (see section 2) and the transmitting fluid used in their studies [15, 16] may have different properties with regard to pressure gradients that can affect the measured pressure at which a transition occurs.[19] It is also possible that the pressures reached in their studies were lower than the pressure required to induce the transitions that we observed in this report. 5. Concluding remarks We have observed markedly similar behaviour in the temperature dependence of the normal state electrical resistivity and evolution of the superconducting critical temperature Tc under applied pressure for the two BiS2-based superconductors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = Pr, Nd). The qualitative behaviour observed for the two compounds in this study is strikingly similar to the results we recently reported for the two BiS2-based superconductors LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce).[14] In each of the four compounds LnO0.5F0.5BiS2 (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd), there is a sizable enhancement of Tc in the superconducting state accompanying the suppression of semiconducting behaviour with pressure in the normal state. The suppression of the semiconducting behaviour in the normal state saturates at a critical pressure Pt which corresponds to the pressure where there is a transition between a low Tc superconducting phase and a high Tc superconducting phase. The semiconducting behaviour of the electrical resistivity in the normal state is consistent with an energy gap that is suppressed with pressure in a similar way. In the particular case of the NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound, there is a pressure-induced semiconductor-metal transition at Pt ≈2 GPa. The coincidence of the saturation of the suppression of semiconducting behaviour in the normal state electrical resistivity with the rapid increase in Tc indicates there may be significant increases in the charge carrier density in the vicinity of the pressureinduced transition. We found that the transition pressure Pt (see section 4) increases with increasing atomic number of the lanthanide element (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) in LnO0.5F0.5BiS2. However, the size of the increase in Tc between the two superconducting phases decreases as lanthanide atomic number increases. The scaling of both the transition pressure Pt and the size of the ""jump"" in Tc with the atomic number of the lanthanide element suggests that the pressure-induced transition between the two superconducting phases may be a structural transition; however, at present, the precise Enhancement of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors mechanism driving the enhancement of Tc with pressure is unknown. X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure on the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 compound are currently underway to help determine whether the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc and the suppression of semiconducting behaviour are related to a structural transition.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"resistivity and µSR measurements have been performed on superconducting Bi4O4S3. Temperature dependence of the upper critical fields and also the absolute value, Hc2(0) = 15.3(4) kOe were determined from the resistivity measurements. The Hc2(T ) data shows a positive curvature close to Tc, which is a sign of multi-gap superconductivity in Bi4O4S3. ZFµSR data show no sign of magnetic anomaly in the superconducting ground state of Bi4O4S3. The temperature dependence of λ-2 is compatible with a twogap s-wave model with the zero-temperature gap values, ∆1(0) = 0.93(3), ∆2(0) = 0.09(4) meV and penetration depth, λ(0) = 861(17) nm. The presence of two superconducting gaps in Bi4O4S3 is predicted by theoretical works such as first principles band structure calculations suggesting two band crossing the Fermi surface and the RPA analysis of a two-orbital model for the BiS2based superconductors [10, 11]. Hall, Seebeck coefficients and magnetoresistance measurements also further support our experimental finding [13, 15]. It is worth mentioning that even though our data are more compatible with a two-gap model, a single-gap model can not be ruled out completely. Our results show that Bi4O4S3 is a bulk superconductor with a fully developed node-less superconducting energy gap and extremely low superfluid density compared to other layered superconductors.

The effective upper critical field ) ( θ GL c H at an angle θ is given by ) ( sin ) ( cos / ) ( 2 2 θ γ θ θ - + = c c GL c H H. (1) Therefore by using a scaling variable ) ( sin ) ( cos ) ( / 2 2 θ γ θ θ - + = H H H GL c, the resistivity measured at different magnetic fields but at a fixed temperature should be scalable to one curve21. In Fig.3a, b and c, we show the angle dependence of the in-plane resistivity at 3, 3.5 and 4 K. Now the measuring current is flowing along a-axis, the magnetic field is always perpendicular to the current direction. Fig.3d presents the scaling behavior according to above mentioned method. One can see that the scaling quality looks quite good for all three temperatures 3, 3.5 and 4 K, yielding the anisotropy of 36, 31 and 30 respectively. Therefore we can safely conclude that the anisotropy of this new superconducting system is about 30-45. Another interesting discovery on the single crystals is the giant superconducting fluctuation effect. In Fig.2a, if we extrapolate the resistivity curve between 20-30 K linearly down to low temperatures, one can see an enhanced excess conductivity clearly above Tc. To illustrate this, in inset of Fig.2b, we present the difference of the resistivity between the measured data (ρ=1/σ) and the extrapolated linear line (ρn=1/σn) n n n σσ σ σ σ ρ ρ ρ / / / ∆ = - ∆ ＝ － ＝, with σ, σn and ∆σ the measured, extrapolated and the excess conductivity, respectively. It is clear that the resistivity difference vanishes at about K. In Fig.2c, we show the resistivity curve on another sample, it is clear that the superconducting fluctuating region extends up to about 20 K, as marked by * T. In order to check whether we really have a strong superconducting fluctuation, we measured the in-plane resistivity with a rotating in-plane magnetic field. The measuring current is along a- (or b-) axis, and the sample is rotated with an in-plane magnetic field. The angle enclosed between the current direction and the magnetic field is φ. When φ=0=π, the Lorenz force on the vortices is zero and thus the dissipation is the minimum, while it becomes maximum with φ=π/2=3π/2. Interestingly the same two fold oscillations appear from 4 K all the way up to 10 K. At 4K, we have strong reason to believe that the vortex motion dominates the dissipation. From the systematic evolution from 4 K to 10 K, we think that the 2-fold resistivity oscillation is still induced by the vortex motion, even at 10 K. This leads to the conclusion that the superconducting fluctuation exists at least up to 10 K from the angle dependent resistive data, although the bulk transition occurs at Tc = 5K. In order to further unravel the superconductivity in the sample, we have measured the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on the single crystals. The measurements were done with a commercial instrument Unisoku-11T with ultra-high vacuum system. The single crystals were cleaved under an ultra-high vacuum then followed by the measurements at a low temperature down to 0.4 K. The details of the measurements and results are given in Methods. One typical set of data measured at temperatures from 0.4 to 26 K is shown in Fig.5a. One can see that, the data measured at low temperatures exhibit clearly two sets of energy gaps, one small gap 3.0 5.3 ± ≈ ∆s meV and a larger gap 5.7 ± ≈ ∆s meV. The small gap is marked by the dashed red line in Fig.5b. Interestingly, at the bias voltage of the small gap, two coherence peaks appear at about 3.5 meV and gradually disappear at about 6 K. Therefore we can conclude that this small gap seems corresponding to the bulk superconducting transition at around 5 K. This feature can be easily observed in the STS with the data normalized by that at 8 K and shown in Fig.5c. As shown in Fig.5b, the larger gap, however, shows up as the energy features at about 7.5±1 meV at low temperatures, and as a suppression to the deferential conductance (dI/dV) or the quasiparticle density of states (DOS) at temperatures above 8 K. This feature can extend to high temperatures and gradually vanishes at about 26 K. One can naturally connect this larger gap to the giant superconducting fluctuations in the resistive measurements. In the resistive data shown in Fig.2a, one can see that the normal state reveals a semiconducting behavior when superconductivity is completely suppressed. Similar phenomenon was observed and emphasized in the polycrystalline CeO1-xFxBiS2 samples previously5,6. This is anti-intuitive to the BCS picture, since a metallic state should be recovered in the normal state. One may argue that this semiconducting behavior is induced by the localization effect of electrons in the low dimensional system as derived from the band structure calculations22,23. This scheme is however also not workable here. For a low dimensional system, impurities may induce a semiconducting behavior due to the localization effect, the magnetic field will weaken this localization effect and the semiconducting feature. While our observation is that, when the superconductivity is suppressed, the semiconducting feature above Tc shows up. In addition, the magnetic field seems enhancing this semiconducting effect in a certain field region. Another possibility is the possible Kondo-like scattering which will induce a semiconducting behavior. This explanation can also be excluded because we don't have this type of strong magnetic impurities in the samples. In addition, the weakening effect of the semiconducting behavior by the magnetic field in a Kondo system is not observed here. For this low dimensional system, there is however a tendency for the charge-density-wave (CDW). When the superconductivity is suppressed, the CDW tendency will be promoted and lead to a semiconducting feature. While the interesting point is that, the ""normal state"" here above Tc ≈ 4.83 K at zero field seems not showing even a weak or negligible semiconducting effect. If it were induced by the CDW tendency, it would show out above Tc even the field is zero. Therefore this semiconducting feature of the normal state under a magnetic field is non-trivial and requires further input. From the STS measurements we observed two gap features at different energies. The smaller gap 2.0 5.3 ± ≈ ∆s meV is corresponding to the bulk superconducting transition at about 5 K. Taking Tc = 4.83 K, the ratio c B s T k / 1∆ = 16.8! This is much larger than the theoretical value 3.5 in the weak coupling limit of the BCS model. If we use the upper boundary of the superconducting fluctuation temperature, for example 20 K as the pairing temperature, we have c B s T k / 1∆ =4.06, which is not far from the BCS value 3.5. This probably suggests that the superconducting pairing occurs at a high temperature (for example K). Because of the very low dimensionality, the superconducting fluctuation is very strong, and the bulk transition at about 5 K is actually corresponding to the phase coherence temperature. This gives strong resemblance to the case in cuprate superconductors. Following this line, the gap feature at 5.7 ± ≈ ∆s meV may be a pseudogap, which may be induced by the tendency of the CDW order, or by the local pairing governed by the valence fluctuation effect of the Bi2+ and Bi3+ ionic states24. If the latter mechanism is proved, this interesting BiS2-based superconductor will provide us a new platform for the novel pairing mechanism of the valence fluctuation. The recent theoretical calculations suggest a significant band splitting due to the spin-orbital coupling effect in the BiS2 based superconductors23. In this case, one can expect a mixture of the spin singlet and spin triplet25 in the system. The clear violation of the predictions of the BCS picture for conventional superconductors observed in this work, i. e., the giant superconducting fluctuation, the huge gap feature and the unexpected semiconducting behavior after the superconductivity is suppressed, will certainly stimulate the enthusiasm of research in this newly discovered superconducting system, especially on single crystal samples26.. Methods I. Sample growth The single crystals were grown by flux method using KCl/LiCl (molar ratio KCl: LiCl =: 2) as the flux. Firstly, the polycrystalline samples were grown by a solid-state reaction. In growing the polycrystalline samples, the starting materials Nd grains (purity 99.9%), NdF3 (purity 99.9%), Nd2O3 (purity 99.9%), Bi2S3 (purity 99.9%) and S (purity 99.9%) were mixed in stoichiometry as the formula NdOxF1-xBiS2. Then we pressed the mixture into a pellet shape and sealed it in an evacuated quartz tube. It was heated up to 750°C for 10 hour. The resultant pellet was smashed and grounded together with KCl/LiCl powder of molar ratio (KCl/LiCl: NdO1-xFxBiS2 = 25: 1) and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. The mixed powder was heated up to 750°C for 5 days followed by cooling down at a rate of 5°C /hour to 450°C. After the samples was cooled to room temperature by shutting off the power of the furnace, we used water to dissolve the flux and got single crystals with lateral sizes of about 1 mm and thickness of about 10-100 µm. II. STM measurements The scanning tunneling spectra (STS) were measured with an ultra-high vacuum, low-temperature, and high-magnetic-field scanning probe microscope USM-1300 (Unisoku Co., Ltd.). The samples were cleaved at room-temperature in ultra-high vacuum with a base pressure about 1×10-9 torr. The cleaved surfaces were always flat and shiny, and the atomically resolved image can be obtained sometimes. However the surfaces were unstable and the spectra showed a semiconductor behavior. This may be originated from the polar BiS top surface after the cleavage. The cleaved surfaces were then cleaned by argon iron bombardment with an acceleration voltage of 1500 V to get a more stable surface. We can obtain the superconducting spectra on such surface after the treatment. In all STM/STS measurements, Pt/Ir tips were used. To lower down the noise of the differential conductance spectra, a lock-in technique with an ac modulation of 1 mV at 987.5 Hz was used.",inline_phrase,finally,References,10979,1870,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1310.0377v1_full.txt,1310.0377v1_full.txt,
True,"We succeeded the growth of F-substituted ROBiS2 (R: La, Ce, Nd) single crystals by using CsCl/KCl flux with different rare earth metals and F substituted contents. The increase of F contents in the starting materials enhanced substituted values of F in the single crystals, but the further increase from 70 % in the starting materials gave the maximum substituted values in the single crystals. These maximum substituted values in the single crystals depended on different rare earth elements. The transport properties of the obtained single crystals were investigated. While their superconducting anisotropies (γs) of the single crystals of RO1-yFyBiS2 (R: La, Nd y = 0.23-0.46) were estimated to be 30-45, that of R = Ce (y = 0.53-0.66) became lower values of 13-21.

True,"In summary, we have successfully synthesized a series of BiS2-based Sr1-xLaxFBiS2 polycrystalline samples. Through the measurements of resistivity and magnetic susceptibility, the parent compound was found to be semiconducting-like with an thermal activation energy Eg ∼38 meV. Via the partial La doping on Sr sites, however, the resistivity decreases sharply, and ultimately superconductivity emerges as x > 0.3 and it reaches Tc of 3.5 K at the optimal level of x = 0.55. The superconducting samples undergo a metal to semiconductor transition/crossover below Tmin, which is seen to be gradually suppressed with further doping whilst Tc remains nearly unchanged above the optimal doping. Hall effect measurements for the La-doped samples confirm that the sign change of RH from positive to negative may be ascribed to the suddenly topology change of the Fermi Surface. A drop in RH and the non-linear transverse resistivity ρxy with field are associated with the multi-band effect or a CDW instability.

The novel BiS2 based superconductor consists of a layered crystal structure built from BiS2 layers and Bi4O4(SO4)1-x block layers, where x indicates the deficiency of SO4 2- ions at interlayer sites [3]. Within few weeks, several other BiS2-based superconductors, with composition ReO1-xFxBiS2 (Re = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) [4-7] appeared, with Tc as high as 10 K. Evidently, these compounds have a common BiS2 layer, which serves as the basic building blocks of this new superconducting family. The carrier doping mechanism in the new BiS2 based superconductors is seemingly the same as for the high Tc cuprates and Fe-Pnictides [4-10]. There are some doubts about the exact crystal structure and superconducting composition of the Bi4O4S3 superconductor [8]. A recent extensive study of these compounds showed that Bi4O4S3 is actually a two-phased material [9]. The two phases are namely Bi2OS2 and Bi3O2S3 and most likely the later one exhibits the superconductivity. Theoretical studies indicated that the Fermi level lies within the conduction bands, which are originating from the Bi 6p orbitals in the BiS2 layer [11-13]. Also exotic multi-band behavior has been reported in the Hall coefficient measurements and it is shown that the charge carriers are mainly electron-type [14]. The chemical doping in the main phase of these superconducting compounds could be a powerful way to increase their Tc and to understand possible mechanism of superconductivity. In one report, Ag has been doped in Bi4O4S3 compound and it is shown that the lattice shrinks gradually with Ag doping and the Tc is suppressed [15]. Keeping in view that there exists only scant reports [15] on the on-site substitution in Bi4O4S3, we report here the effect of Se substitution at S site in bulk polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex (x=0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15). All the studied samples are crystallized in near single phase and the superconductivity is seen to decrease with increase in Se content. For higher (x > 0.15) content of Se in Bi4O4S3-xSex, the resultant material becomes clearly multi phase and the on-site substitution was not possible. It is shown that, Se doping at S site has detrimental effect on superconductivity of Bi4O4S3. Experimental Polycrystalline Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples are synthesized by standard solid state reaction route via vacuum encapsulation. High purity Bi, S, Bi2O3, and Se are weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground thoroughly in a glove box under high purity argon atmosphere. The mixed powders are subsequently palletized and vacuum-sealed (10-3 Torr) in a quartz tube. Sealed quartz ampoules are placed in Box furnace and heat treated at 4000C for 10h with the typical heating rate of 2oC/minute, and subsequently cooled down slowly over a span of six hours to room temperature. This process was repeated twice. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed at room temperature in the scattering angular (2θ) range of 10o-60o in equal 2θ step of 0.02o using Rigaku Diffractometer with Cu Kα (λ = 1.54Å). Rietveld analysis was performed using the standard FullProf program. The electrical transport and magnetization measurements were performed on Physical Property Measurements System (PPMS-14T, Quantum Design) as a function of both temperature and applied magnetic field. Results and discussion Figure 1 shows the Rietveld refined XRD patterns at a room temperature for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples. Reported Wyckoff positions [2] and space group I4/mmm with the tetragonal structure are used to refine the XRD pattern. Some impurities of Bi and Bi2S3 are also seen in the main phase of the Bi4O4S3. The content of Bi2S3 phase slightly increases with increase in Se content. The refined lattice constants of Bi4O4S3 are a = 3.9708(2) Ǻ and c = 41.357(1) Ǻ, and the same slightly increases to a = 3.9717(1) Ǻ and c = 41.419(3) Ǻ for x = 0.15 sample. It is clear from XRD data the lattice slightly expands due to bigger ion Se doping at S site. Temperature dependent dc magnetic susceptibility (M-T) data under 10 Oe magnetic field for the studied Bi4O4S3-xSex samples are shown in Figure 2(a). Magnetization measurements are performed in both ZFC (Zero Field Cool) and FC (Field Cool) modes. Clear diamagnetic transitions are seen at around 4.4 K for Bi4O4S3, 4.2 K for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, 3.7 K for Bi4O4S2.91Se0.09, and 3.5 K for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that though all studied samples show superconductivity, but the Tc is decreasing with increasing Se doping level. Below Tc, the bifurcation of the FC and ZFC data is simply due to the complicated magnetic flux pinning effects. Both the FC and ZFC magnetization data confirmed the appearance of bulk superconductivity in Bi4O4S3-xSex samples. Figure 2(b), represents the AC magnetic susceptibility of the Bi4O4S3 sample, confirming the bulk superconductivity at around 4.5 K. The AC magnetic susceptibility measurements have been carried out at 333 Hz and varying amplitude of 5 - 13 Oe. It can be seen from Fig. 2b, that the imaginary part peak height is increased along with increased diamagnetism in real part of AC susceptibility with change in amplitude from 5-13 Oe. The interesting part is that with increasing AC amplitude the imaginary part peak position temperature (4.5 K) is not changed. This indicates, that the superconducting grains are well coupled and hence nearly no grain boundary contribution in the superconductivity of Bi4O4S3. Inset of the Fig. 2b depicts the Real part of AC susceptibility being measured at applied DC bias fields of up to 4 kOe at temperature 2 K. The upper critical field (Hc2) being determined from in-field AC susceptibility measurements, is 0.5 kOe and 1.973 kOe with 50% and 90% diamagnetism criteria, respectively. The Resistivity versus temperature (ρ-T) plots for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) samples in zero magnetic field are shown in Figure 3. It can be seen from the ρ-T plots that resistivity increases slightly with increasing of Se doping. All samples showed superconductivity, with Tc onset of 4.5 K for Bi4O4S3 and 4.0 K for the x = 0.15. This indicates that the superconductivity is suppressed with the Se doping in the Bi4O4S3-xSex compounds. It is clear indication that the superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 compound is not due to Bi impurity. This is because the Bi content is fixed for all samples and the substitution is done only at S site. Inset of the Figure 3 shows the temperature dependent resistivity in expanded temperature range of 300 - 2.2 K. It can be seen that the all samples exhibit metallic behavior with slightly increasing resistivity for Se doped compounds. Figure 4 (a), (b), and (c) shows the temperature dependence of resistivity under applied magnetic field for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples. Superconductivity is seen at below 4.5K for pristine Bi4O4S3 and the same decreases with Se doping. With increasing applied magnetic field, though both the Tc onset and Tc (ρ = 0) are gradually shifted to lower temperatures, but the shift is comparatively more for the later. This results in broadening of the superconducting transition under applied field, which is similar to the high-Tc layered cuprates and Fe-pnictide superconductors [16, 17]. Figure 5 exhibits the temperature dependent of upper critical field (Hc2) for Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) samples. The Hc2 is evaluated by using resistivity drops to 90% of its normal state value i. e., ρn(T, H) at above Tc onset. The conventional one-band Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) equation Hc2(0) = - 0.693Tc(dHc2 /dT)T=Tc has been used to evaluate Hc2. Thus calculated upper critical field Hc2 WHH(0) is 2.3 Tesla for Bi4O4S3, 2.1 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03, and 1.8 Tesla for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15. It is clear that the Hc2 is decreasing with increase in Se doping concentration. The temperature derivative of resistivity (dρ/dT) for the three superconducting samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03 and 0.15) are shown in Fig. 6 (a), (b) and (c) respectively. Though dρ/dT peak is broadened with field yet only a single transition peak is observed, suggesting better grains coupling in these systems. The broadening of the resistive transition under applied magnetic field can be seen in terms of dissipation energy caused by the motion of vortices in the mixed state. This suggests that superconducting onset is relatively less affected than the Tc (ρ = 0) state. The transition broadening is caused by the creep of vortices, which are thermally activated. The temperature dependence of resistivity in this region is governed by Arrhenius equation [18], ρ(T, B) = ρ0 exp[- U0/kBT] (1) Here, ρ0 is the field independent pre-exponential factor, kB is the Boltzmann's constant and U0 is thermally activated flux flow (TAFF) activation energy. Activation energy can be obtained from the fitted low temperature resistivity data with the Arrhenius equation. Figs. 7(a), (b) and (c) show the experimental data in terms of ln(ρ) vs. T-1 along with the fitting to equation 1. The best fitted data give values of the activation energies to be 18.60 meV for Bi4O4S3, 13.69 meV for Bi4O4S2.97Se0.03 and 13.16 meV for Bi4O4S2.85Se0.15 samples in applied magnetic field of 200 Oe. In low field region, though the activation energy shows weak dependence i. e. U0/kB ~ H-0.35, but is strongly dependent in high field range as U0/kB ~ H-0.85, it could be clearly seen that the field dependence of U0 is different for lower and higher field ranges. This has been observed earlier for some other superconductors as well [16, 17]. In summery we have synthesized near single phase bulk polycrystalline samples Bi4O4S3-xSex (x = 0, 0.03, 0.09 and 0.15) compounds and it is found that the S site Se doping deteriorates superconductivity in Bi4O4S3 system.",inline_phrase,In conclusion,Acknowledgements,10420,1662,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1311.0161v2_full.txt,1311.0161v2_full.txt,
True,"In this section, we will discuss the interesting points of CeO1-xFxBiS2. We found that ferromagnetism and superconductivity simultaneously develop with systematic F doping. In particular, two ferromagnetic phases with respective transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 K were induced with increasing F concentration. This result indicates that carriers generated by F doping are provided to, not only the superconducting BiS2 layers, but also the blocking CeO layers. Thus, we suggest that the observed two ferromagnetic phases are a result of the change in the valence of the Ce ion with changing the F concentration. We found that bulk superconductivity of CeO1-xFxBiS2 could be induced with x ≥ 0.6 in the HP samples. Interestingly, the F concentration where bulk superconductivity appears corresponds to the F concentration where ferromagnetism with a transition temperature of 7.5 K. In this regard, we assume that superconductivity and ferromagnetism are linked to each other in the CeO1-xFxBiS2. In fact, the region with F concentration level of x ≥ 0.7 corresponds with the F concentration where the XRD peaks show the obvious change from the tetragonal phase with lower F concentration. Above x = 0.7, the crystal structure is possibly optimized for the appearance of both ferromagnetism and bulk superconductivity due to high F concentration. In order to reveal this simultaneous development of ferromagnetism and bulk superconductivity, it is quite important to carry out crystal structure analysis and measurements sensitive to the magnetic ordering and the valence state of the Ce ion using single crystals of CeO1-xFxBiS2. Conclusion We found that the coexistence of bulk superconductivity and ferromagnetism can be realized in the BiS2-based superconductor CeO1-xFxBiS2 prepared by high-pressure annealing. In the as-grown samples, weak superconductivity phase and two kinds of ferromagnetic orderings with transition temperatures of 4.5 K and 7.5 K are induced through the continuous substitution of F. This result indicates that carriers generated by the F substitution contribute to both the superconducting and blocking layers. Furthermore, we found that Tc can be increased from 3 K to 8 K by high-pressure annealing at x = 0.7 and 0.9. These samples show strong diamagnetism while keeping the ferromagnetic ordering. Therefore, bulk superconductivity and ferromagnetism intrinsically coexist in CeO1-xFxBiS2 prepared with high-pressure annealing. The enhancement of Tc is achieved around x = 0.7, where the higher temperature ferromagnetic phase (7.5 K) becomes dominant. This fact implies that the appearance of the higher Tc is linked to the evolution of ferromagnetism with the higher magnetic transition temperature of 7.5 K. The CeO1-xFxBiS2 system is a potential system for discussing the correlation between superconductivity and ferromagnetism, and for further applications in superconductivity.",section_header_strict,Discussion,Acknowledgements,2925,435,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1311.4267v1_full.txt,1311.4267v1_full.txt,

True,"We have studied magnetic and transport properties of the high-pressure-synthesized LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 poly crystalline sample under high magnetic fields. The temperature dependence of upper critical field shows anomalous behavior with a characteristic magnetic field of 8 T. We found that the anisotropy of upper critical field of the polycrystalline sample of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 can be estimated by analyzing the characteristic temperatures in the d/dT-T curve. It was found that there were three kinds of upper critical field in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. The lowest upper critical field 0HC2 min is regarded as the 0Hc2 when the magnetic fields are applied parallel to the c axis of the grain. The 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid are regarded as the 0Hc2 where the superconducting states are suppressed for the grains with an orientation of H // ab. The difference between the 0HC2 max and 0HC2 mid could be explained by the anisotropy of superconducting states within the Bi-S plane, which is possibly caused by the lattice distortion or strain within the Bi-S plane. Hence, the upper critical fields 0HC2 a-axis and 0HC2 b-axis are different due to the difference of effective mass. The fraction of the grains in superconducting states decreases with increasing magnetic field in the order of 0 T, 0HC2 min, 0HC2 mid and 0HC2 max. Above 0HC2 max, all the grains become non-superconducting. The estimated d0HC2 max/dT, d0HC2 mid/dT and d0HC2 min/dT are -7.05 (T/K), -2.60 (T/K) and -0.95 (T/K), respectively. The anisotropy parameter for upper critical field estimated using d0HC2 max/dT and d0HC2 min/dT is 7.4, which is clearly lower than the anisotropy parameter of over 30 in the previous report for LaO1-xFxBiS2 single crystals (Tc ~ 3 K) grown at ambient pressure. This indicates that the larger anisotropy of superconductivity is not essential for the enhancement of Tc, and the lower anisotropy might be important for a higher Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2. Moreover, the evolution of the in-plane anisotropy within the Bi-S plane may play an important role for the enhancement of Tc in LaO1-xFxBiS2.",section_header_strict,4.

Nevertheless, the peak symmetry of the (200) peak seems to become more symmetric by high-pressure annealing while the (004) peak does not show such a difference, indicating that the crystal structure within the ab plane changed to a higher-symmetric phase, more perfect tetragonal, by high-pressure annealing in CeO0.3F0.7BiS2.

However, the major difference between doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 samples, prepared either by conventional solid-state reaction at ambient pressure or by high pressure annealing, lies in the sign and magnitude of the Hall resistance, which is positive in sign and larger in magnitude in the former sample and negative in sign and smaller in magnitude in the latter sample. This finding indicates the role played by the multiband character of these compounds. The higher electron concentration of samples prepared by high pressure annealing may be closely related to the enhanced superconducting Tc11 K and to the change of structural parameters.

True,"we revealed that the Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 discontinuously increases. Although our sample does not show zero resistivity at ambient pressure, by applying pressure up to 2.44 GPa, maximum Tc onset and Tc zero were observed at 6.7 K and 5 K. The resistivity of both low- and high-Tc phases shows metallic behavior. This is very different from what was seen in the BiS2 system. The γ extremely decreases from 20 to 9.3 after the phase transition, and the resistivity of the normal conducting state in high-Tc phase gradually increases with increasing applied pressure which is in accordance with the BiS2 system. In this current stage, the optimal Tc of LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 was not observed even at the maximum pressure obtained during this study. Therefore applied further pressure has the potential to induce a much higher Tc in this system.

True,"We have systematically investigated the crystal structure and magnetic properties of BiS2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) to investigate the chemical pressure effects on superconductivity of the REO1-yFyBiS2 systems. In the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 samples, bulk superconductivity is observed for x ≥ 0.5 with y = 0.5 and x = 1.0 with y = 0.3. The Ce1-xNdxO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity. The Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 commonly increases with increasing Nd concentration. The highest Tc onset in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system is 4.8 K for x = 1.0 with y = 0.5. X-ray diffraction analysis indicates that the systematic substitution of Ce by Nd generates chemical pressure along the a axis while c axis does not show a remarkable change on Nd concentration. The lattice constants of c get shorter with increasing F concentration. This result indicates the partial substitution of O by F generates lattice contraction along c axis. Furthermore, we found that Nd can be replaced by smaller Sm ions, up to z = 0.8. Bulk superconductivity is observed within 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.8 with y = 0.3 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.6 with y = 0.5. The Tc onset in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 increased with increasing Sm concentration. The highest Tc is 5.6 K for z = 0.8 with y = 0.3. The Nd1-zSmzO0.3F0.7BiS2 samples exhibit filamentary superconductivity within a range of 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.4. With increasing Sm concentration, the lattice constant of a decreases while the lattice constant of c does not show a remarkable dependence on Sm concentration. The lattice constant of a in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is shorter than that of the shortest value of the lattice constant of a in Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2. This indicates that the effect of chemical pressure in Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 is clearly larger than that in the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 system. We established a three kinds of phase diagram for the Ce1-xNdxO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7) and Nd1-zSmzO1-yFyBiS2 (y = 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7). On the basis of the phase diagrams, both lattice contraction of a axis and optimal F concentration are essential for the inducement of bulk superconductivity in REO1-yFyBiS2. Furthermore, the c/a ratio of the higher Tc samples is concentrated at near c/a = 3.39. Within this region, the chemical pressure along the a axis is the strongest in the studied samples. Therefore, both uniaxial contraction along the a axis generated by chemical pressure and optimal F concentration are important for the inducement of bulk superconductivity with a higher Tc in the REO1-yFyBiS2 superconductors.",section_header_strict,6.

True,"we discuss the thermoelectric performance of the LaOBiS2-xSex system. In order to calculate the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT), we have measured thermal conductivity for the end members (x = 0 and 1.0). Figure 3(a) shows the temperature dependences of thermal conductivity for x = 0 and 1.0. It is found that the thermal conductivity for LaOBiS2-xSex is almost independent of temperature. Furthermore, the obtained values of thermal conductivity are almost the same for LaOBiS2 and LaOBiSSe, indicating that the partial substitution of S by Se does not affect the thermal conductivity in this system. In general, electronic thermal conductivity increases with enhancing metallic characteristics. On another front, the phonon thermal conductivity could decrease by substituting the chalcogen site in LaOBiS2-xSex due to introduction of the randomness. Hence, it is considered that the total thermal conductivity does not change with increasing Se concentration because of the compensation of the changes in the electron thermal conductivity and the phonon thermal conductivity. Therefore, we use a typical (average) value of 2 W/m·K, which is the value estimated at room temperature for LaOBiS2 and LaOBiSSe, to estimate ZT. This  value is consistent with that reported in the previous study on low-temperature thermal properties of LaOBiS2 [19]. The temperature dependences of dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) for LaOBiS2-xSex are plotted in Fig. 3(b). For all the samples, the value of ZT tends to increase with increasing temperature, and it reaches a maximum value at around 470 ºC, which is the measurement limit of the present work. This fact indicates that the LaOBiS2-xSex system is a potential thermoelectric material for the use at high temperatures. The highest value of ZT is 0.17 for x = 0.8 (LaOBiS1.2Se0.8) at 470 ºC. To further increase the thermoelectric performance in this family, precise tuning of carrier concentration and/or local crystal structure are needed. In this family, partial substitutions at the blocking layer can tune both the carrier concentration within the conduction layers and the local structure that largely affects the physical properties [6, 17, 20]. Therefore, a strategy to enhance the thermoelectric performance of this system will be tuning of the structure of the blocking layer. In conclusion, we have synthesized polycrystalline samples of novel layered bismuth chalcogenides LaOBiS2-xSex and systematically investigated thermoelectric properties. It was found that a partial substitution of S by Se enhanced metallic conductivity. The power factor largely increased with increasing Se concentration. The highest power factor was 4.5 W/cmK2 at around 470 ºC for LaOBiS1.2Se0.8. We found that the thermal conductivity for LaOBiS2-xSex is independent of both temperature and Se concentration. Using an average value of thermal conductivity, 2 W/m·K, we calculated the dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) as a function of temperature. The highest ZT was 0.17 at around 470 ºC in LaOBiS1.2Se0.8.

True,We have successfully synthesized SmO1-xFxBiS2 which is a new member of the F-doped LnOBiS2 family. This material is non superconducting and paramagnetic down to 2 K. We have investigated the structure and properties of the Sm substituted materials La1-ySmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 - 1.0) with Sm3+ ions smaller in size as compared with La3+-ions and thus simulating chemical pressure as one effect of the substitution. Structural distortion in the Bi-S plane was analyzed. We find that the Bi-S bond lengths decrease with the increase in the doping level of the smaller Sm ion at the La site. We have observed superconductivity in La1-y SmyO0.5F0.5BiS2 (y = 0.0 - 0.8) and we find that Tc is gradually enhanced upon doping Sm at the La site as y→ 0.8. Absence of superconductivity in SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 is anomalous and deserves to be investigated. We also think that a tuning between these parameters via suitable doping or applied pressure could lead to superconductivity in SmO1-xFxBiS2.

True,"Let us first discuss the issue of Eu MV. As we know, europium is a special rare earth element that frequently shows MV due to the stability of half filling of 4 f orbitals for divalent Eu2+ ions (usually trivalent rare earth is the stable state). Basically, there are two distinct categories for the Eu MV according to its dynamicity. The first MV scenario is homogeneous, in the sense that the mixed-valent Eu ions are indistinguishable in a short time (e. g., 10-9 s). This MV behavior is characterized by valence fluctuations due to hybridization between Eu-4 f electrons with the conduction electrons, as exemplified by EuNi2P2.49 Obviously, it occurs only in a material that all the Eu ions occupy the crystallographically equivalent sites. In contrast, if the Eu ions with different valences selectively occupy the different crystallographic sites, the MV will be static in nature. Such a scenario is called inhomogeneous MV, which is equivalent to static charge ordering. Examples of this category are shown in Eu2CuS3,39 Eu2SiN3,50 and Eu3F4S2,51 etc., where Eu2+ and Eu3+ occupy their individual sites. Note that, in the homogeneous Eu-MV state, vEu usually increases remarkably with decreasing temperature, because of dominant thermal fluctuations (rather than quantum mixing) between the two integer-valence states.52 More frequently, a first-order structural transition occurs accompanying with an abrupt change in vEu. In such cases, the MV becomes inhomogeneous at low temperatures because of static or quasi-static character of MV, as evidenced by two separate lines in the 151Eu Mössbauer spectra.53,54 Compared with the conventional scenarios for Eu MV described above, the Eu-containing bismuth chalcogenides, including Eu-1121 and Eu-3244, exhibit unusual MV behaviors. The Eu valence in Eu-1121 was found to be nearly temperature-independent down to 2 K.22 This has been interpreted by Eu valence fluctuations that couple with the dynamic CDW in the BiS2 bilayers. However, the situation is different here for Eu-3244. There are two crystallographically different sites for the Eu ions. Unlike the aforementioned examples that different Eu sites are occupied by Eu2+ and Eu3+, respectively, the Eu(2) ions at the 2a site are in a MV state, while the 4e-site Eu(1) ions are essentially divalent. Our 151Eu Mössbauer spectra clearly show static or quasi-static MV up to 395 K, and the Eu3+ ions occupy the Eu(2) site. Since the Eu-4 f 7 narrow band touches the Fermi level of the conduction band in Eu-1121,22 it is plausible that, because of stronger crystal field for Eu(2), the Eu(2)-4 f 7 band is lifted further in Eu-3244. Consequently, the Eu(2) ions are in a MV state, driven by the electrons transfer from an Eu(2)-4 f orbital to the conduction bands. On the other hand, the Eu(1)-4 f 7 band is lowered due to the relatively weak crystal field [note that the Eu(1)-BVS value is substantially smaller than the Eu-BVS in Eu-1121]. This leads to a fully filled Eu(1)-4 f 7 band, i. e., the Eu(1) ions are divalent. Future band-structure calculations are expected to clarify this explanation. Owing to the Eu(2) MV with vEu2 ≈2.6(1), the conduction bands of BiS2 bilayers should be self doped with the transferred electrons from the Eu-4 f states, similar to the case in Eu-1121.22 The doping level is estimated to be x ∼0.30(5) electrons per Bi-atom, assuming that stoichiometry is conserved. This explains the appearance of superconductivity as well as the metallic conduction in the undoped Eu-3244. Here we note that similar self doping, via an internal charge transfer from 3d transition metal ions (V and Ti), leads to high-temperature superconductivity in iron-based materials.9,10 Thus, the direction of self doping deserves further attention. It is unexpected that no signature of CDW transition appears in Eu-3244. In general, the enhanced 2D characteristic in Eu-3244 would further stabilize the potential CDW. Therefore, the obvious difference in Eu MV could be relevant. In Eu-3244, the Eu(2) MV occurs in the middle layers of the Eu3F4 block, farther from the BiS2 bilayers. In addition, the Eu(2) ions show much higher valence, leading to a different pattern of charge ordering. These two factors seem to be against the possible coupling between the CDW of BiS2 layers and the Eu MV. Since CDW usually competes with superconductivity, the absence of CDW in Eu-3244 may explain the relatively high Tc value (fivefold of the Tc value in Eu-1121). It is also possible, of course, that the pronounced two dimensionality in Eu-3244 may enhance the superconductivity. Considering the relatively low doping level, one may expect that a higher Tc could be realized by extrinsic chemical doping and/or with applying high pressures. The latter is very expectable since high pressure was found to be very effective to enhance the Tc value in BiS-based materials,55-58 and high pressure may push the parent compound toward metallic conduction.59 Also, in this regard, exploration of new superconductors with the 3244-type structure is of potential interest. Conclusion We have discovered a novel europium bismuth sulfofluoride superconductor, Eu3Bi2S4F4, via a structural-design approach by introducing an additional EuF2 layer into the existing Eu2F2 spacer layers in EuBiS2F. The crystal structure, featured with the existence of two crystallographically distinct europium sites, was determined by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy as well as X-ray diffractions. We investigated the Eu valence state by: (1) structural probing with calculation of Eu-BVS; (2) internal and local probing with 151Eu Mössbauer spectroscopy; and (3) bulk probing with analysis of magnetic properties. The results of these three probes consistently point to an anomalous Eu valence state in which the Eu(1)-site cations are essentially divalent, whilst the Eu(2)-site cations are in a mixed valence state with a valence of ∼+2.6(1). The mixed valence allows charge transfer, which realizes electron doping into the conduction bands that are mainly composed of Bi- 6px and 6py orbitals. That is why we observed metallic conduction and superconductivity in the undoped Eu3Bi2S4F4. Our work could inspire further exploration of new superconductors, especially those with self doping, in BiS2-based and other families.",section_header_strict,Discussion,Acknowledgement,6334,989,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1411.6903v1_full.txt,1411.6903v1_full.txt,

True,"To discuss the relationship between Tc and in-plane chemical pressure, we plotted Tc for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 as a function of in-plane chemical pressure in Fig. 4. To obtain a general tendency in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors, we added data points for Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 [analyzed in this study], NdO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [38], PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 [16], SmO0.5F0.5BiS2 single crystal [18], and LaO0.5F0.5BiSe2 (y = 1) single crystal [39]. Interestingly, data points for all the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type are located on a single slope highlighted by a blue region. Notably, the data points for CeO0.5F0.5BiS2 and SmO0.5F0.5BiS2, which do not exhibit superconductivity, locate on the left region of the boundary suggested in Fig. 4 (in-plane chemical pressure < 1.011). These facts suggest that the emergence of superconductivity and Tc of REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type simply depend on degree of in-plane chemical pressure. If we consider the BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory with electron-phonon mechanisms [40], the enhancement of Tc would be explained by an increase of phonon frequency and/or an enhancement of density of state at the Fermi level. Generally in metals, an increase in overlap of orbitals should decrease density of state due to an increase of band width. Therefore, an increase in density of state could not simply explain the enhancement of Tc in this series. Although phonon frequency might be enhanced with increasing in-plane chemical pressure, further experimental and theoretical investigations are needed to elucidate the mechanisms of the enhancement of Tc with increasing in-plane chemical pressure. Notably, Tc for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 and LaOBiSe2, indicated with a red region, are clearly located on a lower side of that for the REO0.5F0.5BiS2-type series. As an important fact, evolutions of Tc in REO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 do not correspond and exhibit different curves. For the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 compounds, in-plane chemical pressure is relatively stronger than that in REO0.5F0.5BiS2, but their Tc is clearly lower than those of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. As described above, Se preferably occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Therefore, it can be considered that superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 is induced in a Bi-(S, Se) or a Bi-Se plane. If we assume the BCS theory, the lower Tc in Bi-Se plane can be explained by a lower phonon frequency in Bi-Se plane than that in Bi-S plane due to the larger atomic number of Se. In order to confirm the assumption above and mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based family, we need to obtain other REO0.5F0.5BiSe2 superconductors like CeO0.5F0.5BiSe2 or NdO0.5F0.5BiSe2 and add data points on an extension of the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 series. As a conclusion with Fig. 4, we expect that a higher Tc would be obtained with Bi-S plane with a higher in-plane chemical pressure in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2-type compounds. At the end, we briefly discuss about the HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 which shows the highest Tc among BiCh2-based superconductors [13,28-32]. T. Tomita et al. reported that the crystal structure of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 above 0.7 GPa was monoclinic [31]. In the monoclinic structure, the Bi-S1 plane is distorted into a zigzag chain with a shorter Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å; zigzag chains are connected with a longer Bi-S1 distance of 3.03 Å to each other. In fact, we reported in-plane anisotropy of upper critical field within the Bi-S1 plane in a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, implying the emergence of quasi-one-dimensional superconducting states within the distorted Bi-S1 plane of a HP phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [41]. If we simply calculate the value of chemical pressure using a Bi-S1 distance of 2.72 Å with the equation (1), we obtain chemical pressure of 1.06. (In this case, obtained chemical pressure is not in-plane chemical pressure but quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure.) Chemical pressure of 1.06 and Tc of 10 K give a data point locating on a rough extension of the Tc-chemical pressure curve for the other REO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductors discussed in Fig. 4. This might indicate that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure, not in-plane chemical pressure, would be essential for the evolution of superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds. To further discuss and understand the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in the BiCh2 family, investigations of crystal structure and superconducting properties for new BiS2-, BiSe2-based and/or BiTe2-based compounds with various spacer layers are needed. In summary, we have analyzed crystal structure of optimally-doped BiCh2-based superconductors Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using powder synchrotron XRD to reveal relationship between crystal structure and superconducting properties in BiCh2-based layered compounds. We have found that the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure could commonly induce bulk superconductivity in both systems. Furthermore, we revealed that Tc for the REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 superconductors could be determined by degree of in-plane chemical pressure and a kind of Ch element composing superconducting Bi-Ch planes. In addition, on the basis of discussion on the relationship between chemical pressure and superconductivity in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 compounds and a monoclinic phase (high pressure phase) of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, we suggest a possibility that the enhancement of quasi-one-dimensional chemical pressure within a Bi-Ch chain, not in-plane (two-dimensional) chemical pressure, would be essential for a higher Tc in BiCh2-based superconductors. Methods Polycrystalline samples of Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 used in this study were prepared using solid state reaction. The detailed synthesis procedures were described in previous reports [33,34]. Powder synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction measurements were performed at room temperature at the BL02B2 experimental station of SPring-8 (JASRI; Proposal No. 2014B1003 and 2014B1071). The wavelength of the radiation beam was 0.49542(4) Å. We have performed the Rietveld refinement (RIETAN-FP [42]) for Ce1-xNdxO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-ySey)2 using a typical structure model of REOBiCh2-based superconductor with a tetragonal space group of P4/nmm [36,37]. Contributions from impurity phases of rare-earth fluorides (REF3) and/or Bi2S3 are included in Rietveld refinement. In addition, we have analyzed a crystal structure for two related compounds of Nd0.8Sm0.2O0.5F0.5BiS2 and Nd0.6Sm0.4O0.5F0.5BiS2 to enrich the discussion part [33].

True,"Figure 5(a) shows the Tcs at ambient pressure and at ~2 GPa for various BiS2-based superconductors reported to date as a function of a-axis length. The values of a-axis lengths are measured at room temperature and ambient pressure. Tcs are determined by the onset of diamagnetic transition or zero resistivity. In the doped samples, the Tc and a-axis length values are those of the optimally-doped ones. (Sr, La)FBiS2 has the longest a-axis among these compounds. In RE(O, F)BiS2, a-axis shrinks and Tc increases with increasing atomic number of RE from La to Nd. The a-axis lengths of Bi2(O, F)S2 and Bi4O4S3 / Bi3O2S3, whose blocking layers contain fluorite-type BiO layers, are shorter than that of Nd(O, F)BiS2, although ionic radius (coordination number 6)27) of Bi is between Nd and Pr. Tcs of BiS2-based superconductors under ambient pressure show a dome-like tendency with the top of Tc ~5.5 K at a ~3.98 Å in (Nd0.2Sm0.8)(O0.7F0.3)BiS2 28). When a-axis in longer than ~4.0 Å, significant increase of Tc is observed in HP resistivity measurement. In contrast, compounds with shorter a-axis lengths, Bi2(O, F)S2 and Bi4O4S3, show rapid decrease of Tc in HP resistivity measurement. The relation between lattice parameter and Tc for as-synthesized and HP annealed Bi2(O, F)S2 is summarized in Fig. 6. In the optimally-doped samples with a- and c-axes longer than ~3.97 Å and shorter than ~13.73 Å, the value of Tc is maintained at ~5.1 K. In the underdoped samples, a-axis is shorter than ~3.97 Å and c-axis is longer than ~13.73 Å, and Tc increases as a- and c-axis expands and shrinks by HP anenaling. Tcs for undoped Bi2OS2 sintered under high pressures are also in this trend. It should be emphasized that in HP annealed / synthesized undoped Bi2OS2, superconductivity is achieved without intentional carrier doping. In Bi2OS2, the Bi-S planes are not very flat, the in-plane S-Bi-S angle being 159.8°25). The expansion of a-axis may lead to flatter Bi-S plane. In LaOBiS2, F-doping not only increases the carrier concentration but also flattens the buckling of the Bi-S plane and this structural transformation is also related to the appearance of superconductivity29). Similar phenomena would happen in the undoped and underdoped Bi2(O, F)S2 by HP annealing, which resulted in the increases of Tcs in these samples. The decrease of Tc in HP resistivity measurement might be explained by the tendency shown in Fig. 6(a). In HP resistivity measurement, a-axis might shrink by applying high pressures at low temperatures, and superconductivity could be disappeared. Structural analysis on Bi2(O, F)S2 under high pressures at low temperatures would provide fruitful information to clear this point. 5. Conclusion High pressure (HP) resistivity measurement and HP annealing were performed for a BiS2-based superconductor Bi2(O, F)S2, which caused different variation of Tc. In HP resistivity measurement, Tc linearly decreased at the rate of -1.2 K GPa-1. In contrast, by HP annealing at 2 GPa and 470°C, Tc increased in undoped and underdoped samples, and maintained at 5.1 K in optimally-doped sample. In HP resistivity measurement high pressure is applied in-situ at low temperatures, while HP annealing quenches the high pressure and high temperature phase to ambient pressure. Although in both cases hydrostatic high pressure is applied to the sample by a cubic-anvil-type apparatus, the difference between the two methods should be considered carefully.

True,"Motivated by recent experiments in superconducting members of the BiS2 family of compounds showing its 'hidden' 1d electronic structure and the strong effect that pressure has over its superconducting state, we propose an effective 1d model where the kinetic energy part of the Hamiltonian is obtained through DFT calculations for the 2d model for BiS2. Supported by the DOS results shown in Fig. 2, we add the Sulfur p- and s-orbital to the p-orbital of Bismuth. Despite being several eV below the other two orbitals, the s-orbital undergoes strong hybridization with the Bismuth p-orbital and has a sizable contribution to the DOS at the Fermi energy, justifying its inclusion in the model (see Figs. 1 and 2). Pair scattering terms are then added and treated at the mean-field level. We solve the gap equations and systematically probe what combination of pair-scattering terms produce results in qualitative agreement with the experiments, i. e., approximate location of the superconducting phase in a T vs. doping phase diagram, realistic coupling constant values, and dependence with hopping parameters (simulating application of hydrostatic pressure). We find that single-gap SC does not produce acceptable results. This is quite relevant, as there is experimental evidence that BiS2 presents two gaps27. We find that if we consider s- and pb-type pairs, and allow for intra and interband scattering we obtain results in semi-quantitative agreement with experiments. The same is true if we choose pa- and pb-type pairs, and also allow for intra and interband scattering. The interesting point here is that the tsp hopping is the one that, in both cases, enhances SC when its magnitude in5 creases, whereas the effect on ∆of increasing tpp is marginal. This last point reinforces the need for considering the Sulfur s orbital explicitly. We argue that the anti-symmetric character of the tsp hopping (as stressed in previous work by one of the authors23) may explain its enhanced effect in the superconducting state.",section_header_strict,Conclusions.,Acknowledgment.,2022,321,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1508.04820v1_full.txt,1508.04820v1_full.txt,

The characterization of the obtained single crystals clarified the detailed crystal structures, transport properties, and magnetic properties. An increase in the nominal F compositions in the starting materials was found to enhance the values of F concentration in the obtained single crystals. On increasing the nominal F composition, the analytical F composition also increased and reached saturation at 0.45 (R = La), 0.29 (R = Ce), 0.26 (R = Pr), and 0.42 (R = Nd) when the nominal F composition exceeded around 0.6.

True,"By using first-principles total energy and stability calculations, we predict that the local Bi-S distortion leads to three polytypes of LaOBiS2-type materials according to the different stacking pattern of BiS2-like layers. The in-plane distortion, mainly induced by the interaction between the intermediate and the side layers and the electron hybridization in the side layer, can lower the total energy comparing with the conventional accepted P4/nmm structure. In LaOBiS2, the energy difference between the polytypes is small, indicating the possible coexistence of all polytypes in the real sample. While we cannot determine if the superposition is dynamic in nature (time-dependent doping, we note that such a superstructure with the combination of T1, T2 and T3 polytypes will effectively lower the symmetry to the P1 space group. Such a superstructure symmetry has been recently suggested by a single-crystal neutron-diffraction experiment of Athauda et al.32 Finally, external pressure and different choices of the intermediate atoms (replacing La) or active atoms (BiS2) manifest different ground state polytypes.

True,"the absence of any kind of nodes in the gap function of NdO0.71F0.29BiS2. In typical s-wave superconductors, such as Nb, κ(H)/T increases steeply only in the vicinity of upper critical field22. Therefore the increase of κ0(H)/T above H∗ well below Hc2 suggests large modulation of the superconducting gap along the 2D Fermi surface. Finally we discuss the mechanism of the superconductivity in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2. As shown in Fig. 1(b), no discernible anomaly is observed in κ/T at Tc. In the superconductors with strong electron correlation effect, including cuprates23, iron-pnictides24 and heavy fermions25-27, the striking enhancement of the thermal conductivity just below Tc is often observed. This enhancement is caused by the strong suppression of the quasiparticle inelastic scattering rate due to the formation of superconducting gap, which overcomes reduction of the quasiparticle density of states. Therefore the electron correlation effect in the present compound is not strong. Moreover, when electron-phonon coupling is strong, the enhancement of the thermal conductivity below Tc is also often observed by the enhancement of the phonon mean free path due to the gap formation. Thus electron-phonon coupling is also not strong. Until now, several superconducting gap structures, including conventional s-, sign-reversing s-, spin triplet p-, and d-wave symmetries have been proposed theoretically for the BiS2-based superconductors 7-12. Since there is no hole pocket around the Γ-point as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(b), we do not discuss sign-reversing s-wave symmetry. Among d-wave symmetries, we can rule out d-wave with accidental nodes proposed in Ref.[7] and dxy symmetry. The remaining possibilities of the unconventional symmetries are p and dx2-y2, which has no node in the present Fermi surface. However, these unconventional superconductivity is unlikely because of the following reason. The in-plane mean free path ℓis comparable to the in-plane coherence length ξab = p Φ0/(2πHc c2) = 18 nm. In fact, ℓis estimated to be ∼30 -50 nm by using the relation ℓ= (µ0λ(0)2vF)/ρ0, where Fermi velocity vF is reported to be vF = 0.95 × 106 m/s by angle resolved photo emission spectroscopy28 and ρ0=500∼800µΩcm of this study and the previous reports14,19. This robustness of the superconductivity against the impurity appears to be at odds with the unconventional pairing symmetries. These considerations lead us to conclude that NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 is likely to be a conventional s-wave superconductor. In summary, to clarify the superconducting gap structure of NdO0.71F0.29BiS2, we performed thermal conductivity measurements down to 100 mK. Thermal conductivity shows no discernible anomaly at Tc, suggesting that both of the electron correlation and electron-phonon coupling effects are not strong. The absence of residual thermal conductivity indicates that a residual normal fluid, which is expected for nodal superconductors with impurities, is absent. The magnetic field hardly affects the thermal conductivity up to ∼0.2Hc c2, indicating the absence of Doppler shifted quasiparticles. These results provide evidence that NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 is a fully gapped superconductor. Notably, the estimated mean free path is comparable to the superconducting coherence length, indicating that the superconductivity is robust against impurity. Based on these results, we conclude a conventional s-wave superconducting state in NdO0.71F0.29BiS2. This puts a strong constraint on the theory of the superconductivity of BiS2-based layered compound, whose electronic and crystal structures bear some resemblance to Fe-based superconductors.",inline_phrase,to conclude,We thank,3649,534,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1601.03502v2_full.txt,1601.03502v2_full.txt,
True,"the possible strategies for enhancing the thermoelectric performance are discussed on the basis of the experimental and the theoretical facts reviewed here. 1. Introduction Thermoelectric energy conversion is a promising technology for solving energy problems because the energy of the waste heat can be directly converted to the electrical energy. So far, the available thermoelectric devises have been limited due to the absence of high performance thermoelectric materials. To estimate the performance of thermoelectric materials, dimensionless figure-of-merit (ZT) is generally used. The ZT can be calculated as ZT = S2T/, where S, T, , and  are Seebeck coefficient, absolute temperature, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity, respectively. Hence, a large absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient, low electrical resistivity, and low thermal conductivity are required for a high ZT. Typically, in a conventional semiconductor, S is proportional to T/n, where n is carrier concentration with a single band approximation. The  is proportional to 1/en, where  is carrier mobility. Therefore, insulators (or semiconductors with a large band gap) exhibit large absolute S, but their  is usually large. In contrast, metallic compounds exhibit low , but absolute S of metallic compounds is generally small. Due to this trade-off relationship of the electrical factors (S and ), the enhancement of S2/ (power factor: PF) is quite difficult. The material, which satisfies both large S and low , is semiconductors with a narrow band gap [1]. For example, the Bi2Te3 family possesses such a band structure and shows a high performance of ZT ~1 at around 300 K due to the large  and the suitable n [2,3]. Hence, Bi2Te3-based compounds have been used as a practical thermoelectric material for a long time [2]. Another strategy for enhancing ZT is the use of the quantum-size effect. The ZT of Bi2Te3-based system can be enhanced up to 2.4 by fabricating the Bi2Te3/Sb2Te3 super-lattice devise [4,5]. In addition, the quantum-size effect can be expected to positively work in enhancing ZT in the compounds with a layered structure. One of the examples is the layered Co oxides, such as NaCoO2 and related layered compounds [6-8]. These compounds show anomalously large S owing to the strong electron correlations, and the  of these compounds is reduced by the phonon scattering at the interface of the layers. In addition, layered compounds typically possess the great flexibilities of stacking structure and constituent elements as demonstrated in the Co oxides [6-8], which results in the desirable tuning of the electronic structure and the local crystal structure. Therefore, one can say that the layered structure is greatly suitable for designing high ZT materials. In 2012, we discovered new layered superconductors whose crystal structure is composed of the alternate stacks of the BiS2 bilayer (electrically conducting layer) and the electrically insulating blocking layers [9-11]. The parent phase (for example, LaOBiS2 with the structure of Fig. 1(a)) is a semiconductor with a band gap [9,12]. When electron carriers were generated in the Bi-6p orbitals by partial substitutions of O by F (in the La2O2 blocking layers), the F-substituted compounds (LaO1-xFxBiS2) becomes metallic and shows superconductivity at low temperatures [10,12]. Furthermore, the La2O2 blocking layer can be replaced by the RE2O2 layers (RE: rare earth or Bi) or other oxide (or fluoride) layers as shown in Fig. 1. Indeed, the crystal structure can be flexibly modified by changing the blocking layer structure in the BiS2-based compound family [11]. Focusing on the electronic state, we noted that the calculated bad gap were relatively small, and some parent compounds showed low electrical resistivity (as compared normal semiconductors). In addition, the thermal conductivity of the LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples were relatively small [13]. Thus, we considered that the BiS2-based layered compounds could be a layered thermoelectric material family as the Bi-Te family or the layered Co oxides family. In this article, the crystal structure variation of the layered Bi-chalcogenide family and the physical properties of those Bi chalcogenides are reviewed. Finally, the possible strategies for enhancing thermoelectric properties of the Bi chalcogenides are discussed. This article contains new (unpublished) results on CeO1-xFxBiS2, NdO1-xFxBiS2, and LaOBiPbS3. Therefore, we briefly explain the experimental procedures. The polycrystalline samples were prepared using a conventional solid-state-reaction method with reaction temperatures of 700-800 ºC. The purity and the crystal structure of the obtained samples were investigated using powder X-ray diffraction. The reaction or the annealing processes were carried out in an evacuated quartz tube. Temperature dependence of  and S were measured using a four-terminal method with ZEM-3 (Advance Riko). 2. Crystal structure of layered Bi chalcogenides Typical crystal structures of the layered Bi chalcogenides are summarized in Fig. 1. All the compounds have a layered structure composed of the alternate stacks of the electrically conducting layer and the electrically insulating blocking layer. The typical structures are categorized into the tetragonal (P4/nmm or I4/mmm) space group. These Bi chalcogenides have NaCl-type Bi-Ch conducting layers: Bi2Ch4 layer (BiCh2 bilayer) or M4Ch6 layer (M: Bi, Pb). Since the conducting layers contain a two-dimensional Bi-Ch square lattice, the layered Bi chalcogenides exhibit two-dimensional electrical transport. Figures 1(a-c) are the crystal structures of BiS2-based compounds with the BiS2 bilayer (Bi2S4 layer) as a conducting layer. Among them, the REOBiCh2 (RE: rare earth or Bi; Ch: S or Se) structure (Fig. 1(a)) is the most popular one. In this structure, the Bi2S4 layer is a conducting layer, and the RE2O2 layer acts as a blocking layer. When electron carriers were doped by partial substitutions of O by F, the RE(O, F)BiCh2 compounds become a superconductor with a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) as high as 11 K [10,11]. The RE site of RE(O, F)BiS2 can be occupied by La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Yb, and Bi [10,14-22]. In the case of RE = La, the RE site can be partially substituted with Y, Ti, Zr, Hf, and Th [23,24]. In addition, the S site can be substituted by Se. The RE(O, F)BiS2-xSex-type compounds were reported for RE = La, Ce, and Nd [25-29]. Furthermore, the end member La(O, F)BiSe2 can be synthesized for RE = La [30]. The RE2O2 layer of the REOBiS2 structure can be replaced with the Sr2F2 or Eu2F2 layer, which results in the SrFBiS2 or EuFBiS2 compound [31,32]. The Sr (or Eu) site can be partially substituted by RE; the RE substitution dopes electron carriers into the BiS2 layer [34,35]. In addition, the Sr site can be partially substituted by Ca [32]. Owing to these great flexibility on element substitutions for the RE and Ch sites, the REOBiCh2-type structure has been actively studied, and is particularly important to understand the physical properties of the layered Bi-chalcogenide family. Figure 1(b) is a crystal structure of Eu3F4Bi2S4 [36] with a Eu3F4 blocking layer. The Eu3F4 layer can be regarded as the double Eu2F2 layers combined to each other with Eu-site sharing. The material itself is a superconductor, and the superconducting Tc was enhanced by Se substitution in Eu3F4Bi2S2-xSex [37]. Figure 1(c) is a crystal structure of Bi4O4SO4Bi2S4, whose structure can be regarded as the alternate stacks of the Bi4O4SO4 blocking layer and the Bi2S4 conducting layer (BiS2 bilayer). It has been considered that the SO4 site in the blocking layer can have some defects, which provides electron carriers into the BiS2 layers [9]. Indeed, the Bi4O4S3 compound with 50% SO4 defects (namely, Bi4O4(SO4)0.5Bi2S4) becomes a superconductor with Tc ~ 5 K [9]. Due to the difficulty in determining the SO4 site structure using polycrystalline samples and the absence of single crystals, the precise determination of the SO4 site structure (and the composition) has not been achieved yet [38]; some reports suggested the Bi3O2S3 (= Bi4O4S2Bi2S4) phase was also formed and showed superconductivity [39,40]. Recently, a new Bi-chalcogenide compound with a thick conducting layer of M4S6 (M = Bi, Pb) was synthesized. Figure 1(d) shows the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 [41]. In this structure, an NaCl-type M-S block (layer) is intercalated at between BiS2 layers. Also, this conducting layer can be regarded as the 4-layer-type structure. Thus, the crystal structure variation can be developed by fabricating the multi-layer-type conducting layers as well as by changing the blocking layer structure as demonstrated in the structures of Fig. 1(a-c). We note that the distorted-NaCl-type M4S6 conducting layer is structurally similar to the Bi4Te6 conducting layer of CsBi4Te6, which is a known thermoelectric material (Fig. 1(e)) [3], although the space group of CsBi4Te6 (monoclinic C2/m) is different from that of LaOBiPbS3 and the BiS2-based compounds (tetragonal P4/nmm or I4/mmm). The structural symmetry lowering from tetragonal to monoclinic was recently revealed in a single crystal of LaOBiS2 by synchrotron X-ray experiments [42]. Although the X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the polycrystalline LaOBiS2 samples suggested the space group of tetragonal P4/nmm, the crystal structure of the LaOBiS2 single crystal was determined to be monoclinic P21/m. This different results in between polycrystalline and single crystal samples would indicate the crystal structure instability in the BiS2-based compounds. At the same time, the structure instability can be regarded as the structure flexibility in the same group of compounds. Thus, we consider that the Bi-chalcogenide family possesses great flexibility of crystal structure (including space group, stacking sequence, and constituent elements), and hence, it is very useful to explore new materials with a high thermoelectric performance. 3. Thermoelectric properties of LaOBiS2-based compounds 3-1. LaO1-xFxBiS2 Here, we focus on the LaOBiS2 systems. As introduced above, LaOBiS2 is one of the parent phases of the BiS2-based superconductor, and shows semiconducting-like electrical transport below the room temperature [10]. Band calculations suggested that the LaOBiS2 is a semiconductor with a relatively narrow band gap (< 1 eV) [12]. Partial substitutions of the O site by F generate electron carriers in the BiS2 conducting layers, and the F-substituted LaO1-xFxBiS2 shows a superconducting transition at low temperatures [10]. We considered the LaOBiS2-based compounds could exhibit a high thermoelectric properties since we observed a low thermal conductivity in the LaO1-xFxBiS2 samples ( ~ 2 W/mK at 300 K) [13]. Thus, we measured high-temperature thermoelectric properties (, S, and PF) of LaO1-xFxBiS2 and investigated the effect of the F substitution (electron doping) to the thermoelectric properties [43]. Figures 2(a-c) show the temperature dependences of (a) , (b) S, and (c) PF for LaO1-xFxBiS2. As depicted in Fig. 1(d), the electron carrier concentration is expected to increase with increasing F concentration. The  of x = 0 increases with increasing temperature, and an anomaly (a hump) is observed at around 500 K. Although the origin of the anomaly has not been clarified yet, it may be related to the (local) structure distortion because the crystal structure of LaOBiS2 can be distorted into monoclinic as revealed in the single crystal structure analysis using synchrotron X-ray [42]. With increasing F concentration, the values of  decrease at whole temperatures. The S was negative for all the F concentration at whole temperatures (tested in these experiments), which indicates that the mainly-contributing carrier is electron in this system. The absolute value of S increases with increasing temperature. One of the important facts is the absolute S largely decreases with increasing F concentration. As a result, the values of the PF rapidly decrease with F substitution as shown in Fig. 2(c). Indeed, in the LaOBiS2 system, the electron doping obviously degrades the thermoelectric properties [13,43]. To enhance the thermoelectric performance (PF) in the LaOBiS2 system, decreasing  without degradation of the absolute S is required. Thus, we next investigated the effects of partial substitutions of S by Se in the conducting layers. 3-2. LaOBiS2-xSex The S site of LaOBiS2 can be partially substituted by Se [44]. In LaOBiS2-xSex, both S and Se have the same valence of -2 (S2- and Se2-). Hence, the Se substitution does not affect the valence of Bi and does not dope electrons, but it should affect the band structure because of the difference of ionic radii of S2- (184 pm) and Se2- (198 pm). Upon the substitution of larger Se2-, the enhancement of the orbital overlap between Bi and Ch should be expected. Figures 3(a-c) show the temperature dependences of (a) , (b) S, and (c) PF for LaOBiS2-xSex [44]. Figure 3(d) is the crystal structure of LaOBiS2-xSex and the definitions of the Ch1 and the Ch2 sites. With increasing Se concentration, the values of  decrease, indicating that the Se substitution enhances electric conductivity in LaOBiS2-xSex. The values of S are all negative as observed in LaO1-xFxBiS2, which suggests that the electrons are mainly contributing in electrical transport in LaOBiS2-xSex. The absolute values of S do not show a remarkable change up to x = 0.6, and it slightly decreases at x = 0.8 and 1. The small changes in the S with increasing Se concentration imply that the carrier concentration is not largely affected by the Se substitution. In addition, as will be shown later, the densified LaOBiSSe sample shows the S value comparable to that of LaOBiS2. Thus, we consider that the Se substitution does not largely affect carrier concentration, but it enhances metallic conductivity due to the enhanced carrier mobility; actually, the large enhancement of mobility with increasing Se concentration was revealed in our recent Hall measurements [45]. This can be understood with the concept of in-plane chemical pressure effect as demonstrated in REO0.5F0.5BiCh2-type superconductors [46]. The increase of Se concentration in the BiCh plane results in the enhancement of orbital overlaps between Bi and Ch. It can be considered that the enhanced orbital overlap enhances the carrier mobility, and hence, the metallic conductivity is enhanced. Finally, the calculated PF is shown in Fig. 3(c) as a function of temperature. The PF is clearly enhanced with increasing Se concentration, and large PF values exceeding 4 W/cmK2 are observed for x = 0.8 and 1 in LaOBiS2-xSex. Indeed, the Se substitution largely enhances the thermoelectric performance in the LaOBiS2 system. 3-3. Densified LaOBiSSe The experimental results on LaOBiS2-xSex shown above were based on the polycrystalline pellet samples with a typical relative density of 85-90%. Thus, we densified the LaOBiS2-xSex samples using a hot-press (HP) instrument under an applied pressure of 50 MPa and annealing temperature of 700 or 800 ºC, with which high density samples were obtained (relative density > 97%) [45,47]. Here, we show the thermoelectric properties of LaOBiSSe because the highest performance was attained in the HP-LaOBiSSe sample among x = 0-1. Due to the uniaxial pressure in the densification process, the obtained sample can possess anisotropic crystal (grain) orientation. So, let us firstly mention the crystal orientation of the HP sample. Figure 4(a) shows the XRD patterns for the powder and pellet samples; for the pellet samples, the scattering vector of X-ray is parallel or perpendicular to the pressing (HP) direction (P// or P). The definitions of the P// and P directions are shown in Fig. 4(b). The XRD results propose that the HP process does not affect the phase purity because any impurity phases were not generated. The peak intensities were different in between P// and P, indicating that the obtained sample was oriented as expected. However, we found that the crystal orientation in the HP sample was very weak: the difference of the peak intensities of the (h00) and the (00l) peaks for P// and P are not large. (If the sample was completely oriented, only the (h00) or the (00l) peaks should be observed as in the case of thin films.) Figure 4(c) shows the temperature dependences of  for two measurement directions (measured with currents of I // P// or I // P). The  increases with increasing temperature for both, and the values of  for P are clearly lower than those of P//, which is consistent to the fact that the ab plane of the LaOBiSSe grains is relatively oriented along the P direction. The BiS2-based compounds essentially show two-dimensional electrical conduction [48]. Figure 4(d) shows the temperature dependences of S. For both samples, negative S is observed. The absolute values of S for P// are slightly larger than those of P, which is also consistent with the difference in the  and the crystal orientation. As a result, the PF values for P are larger than those for P//. To estimate ZT,  was also measured for these samples (Fig. 4(e)). The  decreases with increasing temperature, and the values of  for the P direction are clearly larger than those for the P// direction. This result indicates that the thermal conductivity along the c axis is obviously smaller than that along the a axis. Figure 4(f) shows the temperature dependences of ZT for both measurement directions. The values of ZT for P// are slightly larger than those for P, and the ZT for these directions at the highest temperature (tested in the study) is almost the same. These results suggest that the thermoelectric performance of LaOBiSSe is not largely affected by the crystal orientation because one direction possesses a good (high) PF, and the other direction possesses a good (low) . This characteristic on the insensitivity of ZT to the crystal (grain) orientation may be useful when considering practical application of these BiCh2-based materials. 4. Properties of other layered Bi chalcogenides Up to here, we focused on the properties of LaOBiS2-based systems. As mentioned with Fig. 1, one of the merits of the Bi-chalcogenide layered compound family is the crystal structure variety. Thus, in this section, we briefly introduce the thermoelectric properties of REO1-xFxBiS2 (RE = Ce or Nd) and EuFBiS2 with the REOBiCh2-type structure. In addition, the properties of LaOBiPbS3 with the 4-layer-type compound (Fig. 1(d)) at high temperatures are shown. 4-1. REO1-xFxBiS2 Figures 5(a-c) show the temperature dependences of , S, and PF for CeO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0, 0.25, and 0.5. The values of  for x = 0 (CeOBiS2) are clearly lower than those of LaOBiS2. It has been reported that the polycrystalline sample of CeOBiS2 shows metallic conductivity at low temperature [14], which seems to be consistent to the present data. In contrast, the single crystal of CeOBiS2 shows semiconducting behavior at low temperatures [49]. On the basis of these diverse experimental facts in polycrystalline samples and single crystals, the electronic states can be different in between these two sample forms. As a fact, the photoemission experiment suggested that the Ce valence is in the mix-valence state of Ce3+ and Ce4+ [50], which should provide excess electron carriers to the BiS2 conducting layers. Local structure distortion and/or the effect of the grain size may be affecting the Ce valence and the electronic states of polycrystalline CeOBiS2. The low absolute values of S for CeOBiS2 (Fig. 5(b)) seems to be consistent with the mixed-valence scenario in CeOBiS2 because the absolute value of S of semiconductors generally decreases with increasing carrier concentration. As a result, the PF for CeOBiS2 is lower than that of LaOBiS2 and comparable to electron-doped LaO0.95F0.05BiS2. For x = 0.25 of CeO1-xFxBiS2, the values of  are larger than those for x = 0. The absolute values of S for x = 0.25 are also larger than those of x = 0. For x = 0.5, the values of  and absolute S are lower than those for x = 0. These experimental results suggest that the effects of F substitutions to the thermoelectric properties in CeO1-xFxBiS2 cannot be simply understood. First, we have to consider the effect of the mixed-valence states of Ce. In addition, we are tuning electron carriers by the F concentration. Furthermore, the carrier mobility should largely affect the electrical transport as shown in LaOBiS2-xSex. Actually, the a-axis is expanded with increasing F concentration in these CeO1-xFxBiS2 samples and in the previous reports as well [14]. By simply estimating the in-plane chemical pressure effect in CeO1-xFxBiS2, the elongation of the a-axis should result in the decrease in in-plane chemical pressure (decrease in orbital overlap) and carrier mobility. These multiple factors make the understanding of the thermoelectric properties of CeO1-xFxBiS2 quite difficult. Anyway, the replacement of the La2O2 blocking layer to the Ce2O2 layer does not positively work in enhancing PF. Next, let us introduce the properties of NdO1-xFxBiS2 with x = 0.25 and 0.5; unfortunately, the polycrystalline samples of x = 0 cannot be obtained in the system. Figures 5(d-f) show the temperature dependences of , S, and PF for NdO1-xFxBiS2. Both samples show similar temperature dependences of  and S, but the values of  for x = 0.25 are lower than those for x = 0.5 while the nominal composition of doped F is half in the x = 0.25 sample. The almost same values of S would suggest that the effective carrier concentration is almost the same. This assumption is consistent with the fact that the superconducting transition temperature of the NdO1-xFxBiS2 system is not sensitive to the F concentration within a wide range of x = 0.1-0.7 [16,51,52]. The a-axis of NdO1-xFxBiS2 also increases with increasing F concentration. The larger  values for x = 0.5 than those for x = 0.25 may be resulting from the decrease in the in-plane chemical pressure with the a-axis elongation as well as in CeO1-xFxBiS2. As facts, the values of PF for NdO1-xFxBiS2 are quite low as compared to LaOBiS2-xSex. As shown here, the replacement of the La2O2 blocking layer to the other RE2O2 blocking layer does not positively work in enhancing PF. In addition, the Se substitution for the S site cannot be demonstrated in the Ce- or Nd-based compounds. The reason may be due to the ionic radius of Se2-, which would be too large for the Ce2O2 or Nd2O2 blocking layers. Next, we review the recent studies on EuFBiS2 and LaOBiPbS3. 4-2. EuFBiS2 EuFBiS2 crystalizes in the tetragonal P4/nmm space group, which can be obtained by replacing the La2O2 layer of LaOBiS2 to the Eu2F2 layer (Fig. 6(c)). This material shows metallic conductivity and shows a superconducting transition at 0.4 K [32]. Goto et al. measured thermoelectric properties of EuFBiS2 at high temperatures [53]. Figures 6(a, b) show the temperature dependences of  and S for EuFBiS2. At T = 300-623 K, the  showed a slight decrease with increasing temperature but the values were almost constant ( = 3.5-4 mcm). The S at 300 K was -32 V/K, and the absolute value of S increased with increasing temperature and reached -50 V/K at 623 K. The estimated  at 300 K was about 2 W/mK, which was also low and close to that of LaOBiS2. Indeed, low thermal conductivity seems to be a general characteristic of the layered Bi-chalcogenide family. The calculated PF and ZT were 0.71 W/cmK2 and 0.02 at 623 K, respectively. We consider that the low ZT (PF) in EuFBiS2 can be attributed to the excess electron carriers as in the case of CeOBiS2. Zhai et al. proposed that the Eu valence in EuFBiS2 is not +2 but +2.1-2.3, and the metallic characteristics were resulting from the excess electron carriers doped in the BiS2 layers due to the mixed-valence state of Eu [32]. The carrier concentration (n) estimated from the Hall measurement is 3.2×1021 cm-3, which is clearly larger than those of the parent phases of REOBiS2. Therefore, a high ZT cannot be obtained in EuFBiS2 without compensation of the excess electron carriers in the BiS2 layers. 4-3. LaOBiPbS3 As introduced in Fig. 1, LaOBiPbS3 has the 4-layer-type conducting layer, which is similar to the Bi4Te6 conducting layer of CsBi4Te6 [3,41]. Hence, this material is very important to discuss how we can enhance the thermoelectric properties of the Bi-chalcogenide layered compound family. Sun et al. reported thermoelectric properties of LaOBiPbS3 below the room temperature [41]. The  at 300 K was ~8 mcm, and the  largely increased with decreasing temperature (particularly below K). The S at 300 K was -50 V/K. The  at 300 K was ~4 W/mK. Using these data, the PF and ZT at 300 K can be calculated to be 0.31 W/cmK2 and 0.0023, respectively. We examined the thermoelectric properties of LaOBiPbS3 at high temperatures. Figures 7(a-c) show the temperature dependences of , S and PF for LaOBiPbS3. The values of  are 7-8 mcm at between 300 and 740 K, and the  does not show a large change with increasing temperature. In contrast, the absolute values of S shows a large increase with increasing temperature. The S at 740 K is -92 V/K. Hence, the calculated PF largely increases with increasing temperature and reaches 1 W/cmK2 at 740 K. Although the values of PF for LaOBiPbS3 are still lower than those for LaOBiSSe, the PF will be enhanced by increasing carrier mobility as demonstrated in LaOBiS2-xSex. 5. Summary and possible strategies for a high thermoelectric performance We reviewed the crystal structure variation and the physical properties of the new Bi-chalcogenide layered compound family. Here, we briefly summarize the evolution of thermoelectric properties by the element substitution or the manipulation of the layered structure and would like to discuss the possible strategies for a high thermoelectric performance in the layered Bi-chalcogenide compound family. One of the advantages of the layered Bi-chalcogenide compounds as a thermoelectric material is the low thermal conductivity. The values of  are quite lower than that of the other chalcogenides or other inorganic materials with electrical conduction. In addition, as shown in the part of LaOBiSSe, the  decreases with introducing disorder as the Se substitution for the S site in LaOBiS2-xSex. Therefore, the thermal conductivity will be tunable at the final stage of the material design of Bi-chalcogenide thermoelectric materials. Thus, we need to enhance PF at the early stage, and now, we are exploring new materials with PF higher than that of LaOBiSSe. On the basis of the results of the electron doping in LaO1-xFxBiS2, the excess electron carriers should degrade the PF. In addition, the compounds containing self-doped carriers, such as CeOBiS2 or EuFBiS2, shows a lower performance due to the excess carriers as well. Namely, the parent compound with a band gap should be preferable for a high PF material, which seems to be consistent with the Mott relationship (S can be expressed as a function of T/n) as used in the study of LaO1-xFxBiS2 [13]. Therefore, the lower n would result in a high absolute value of S in this system. To discuss this assumption, we plotted the n and the S reported in Refs. 13, 32, 41, 45, and 53 in Fig. 8. The values of n for these compounds were estimated from the Hall measurements by assuming the single-band model for contributing carriers, which are electrons in the present system. Since the Hall coefficient of the electron-doped compounds could not be explained from the single-band model [13], we excluded those electron-doped compounds from this plot. At least, the data points in Fig. 8 ride on a single slope: the absolute values of S are related to the n. Thus, a lower n should be needed for a larger value of absolute S. Next, we need to decrease the  without decrease of absolute S. The strategy to achieve this situation should be the enhancement of in-plane chemical pressure effect, which can increase the carrier mobility by the enhancement of in-plane orbital overlaps. On the basis of this scenario, the Bi3+-Se2- or the Bi3+-Te2- bonding will be preferable than the Bi3+-S2- bonding. In addition, the Pb2+ ion will be useful to enhance the in-plane chemical pressure because the Pb2+ possesses a large ionic radius. Furthermore, the crystal structure symmetry lowering from tetragonal to monoclinic (or orthorhombic) may be useful to enhance the carrier mobility. The LaOBiCh2 structure can be distorted from tetragonal (P4/nmm) to monoclinic (P21/m). In the monoclinic structure, Bi-Ch zigzag chains form in the conducting plane, which should strongly affect the electronic states [42,54,55]. With these possible strategies for enhancing PF in the layered Bi-chalcogenide compounds, we are going to explore a breakthrough material for the achievement of the novel thermoelectric applications.",inline_phrase,"Finally,",Acknowledgements,29051,4635,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1602.05320v1_full.txt,1602.05320v1_full.txt,
True,"AND SOME PREDICTIONS What is novel in our work is the organization of a dilute fermi sea in a band insulator, into states containing certain diagonal valence bonds (charge -2e Cooper pairs). These states range from Cooper pair Wigner crystal to weakly coupled array of 1d Mott-Hubbard chains. The family of states we have suggested could support isotropic as well as anisotropic 2d Kosterlitz-Thouless superconductivity. It is likely both occur in different members of the BiS2 family for different range of parameters. Self organization we have suggested, interestingly, makes onsite coulomb repulsion important, while trying to avoid near neighbor coulomb repulsions. It is a delicate interplay between onsite interaction and residual long range coulomb interactions, that leads to doped Mott physics and superconductivity. In the Cooper pair Wigner crystal phase we have proposed, a disorder free LaO0,5F0.5BiS2 is likely to be an insulator. In an ideal situation deviation away from x = 0.5 will act like a doping parameter. Disorder could quantum melt and create superconductivity even for x = 0.5. It will be interesting to see if the superconducting dome, currently observed around x = 0.5, develops a dip around x = 0.5 in superconducting Tc as a function of x, with decrease in disorder. Diagonal valence bond singlets Bi-S-Bi play a fundamental role in our theory. Topological defects in the generalized Wigner crystal may contain a finite density of unpaired spins (spinons) through broken diagonal valence bonds. This may lead to low temperature Curie contribution to spin susceptibility. In the present paper we have only focussed on certain simple energy minimizing generalized Wigner crystal states. A closer look suggests that a variety of ordering of diagonal singlets, with closeby energies are possible. One also expects glass like organization of the diagonal singlets for some range of parameters, leading to interesting electron pair glass or valence bond glass phases. As we indicated earlier, in the Mott-Hubbard chain scenario p-wave instability nematic metallic state etc. are interesting possibilities. Self organized states we have presented in this paper could be easily affected by disorder and temperature. So we expect interesting phase transitions as a function of temperature and disorder. As there is a spontaneous translation and orientational symmetry breaking associated with the self organization interesting topological defects, induced charges are possible. To test our theory it will be interesting to look for signals for enhanced antiferromagnetic (spin singlet) correlations in neutron and NMR experiments. Electronic coupling between two Bi-S layers in the BiS2 bilayers [40], in our theory, could play important role in stabilizing different generalized Wigner crystals and their quantum melting properties. This needs to be investigated. Instability towards the two phases we have talked about can also be justified using a weak coupling approach and a proper use of Umklapp electron pair scattering. They help build Mott localized spin singlet pairs [66]. Our self organized Wigner crystal that supports doped Mott Hubbard chains or sheets is different from the stripes one sees in underdoped cuprates and other Mott insulator based systems [67]. We organize strongly correlated systems starting from a fermi sea in a doped band insulator. Whereas stripe states in cuprates are reorganizations of an underlying Mott insulator after doping. Electron phonon interaction will play very important role for small value of x. It is likely to stabilize isolated or islands, or even ordered arrays of Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bonds. In the superconducting state, where valence bonds are delocalized, it is likely to play less important role. We hope to presemt, in a future publication, a general theory of RVB states in doped band insulators from Coulomb forces and apply to other systems [2-8], HfNCl, WO3, diamond, Bi2Se3 families, STO/LAO interface, gate doped SrTiO3, MoS2 etc., alluded to at the beginning. X. SUMMARY In this article we discussed the puzzling phenomenology of the BiS2 layered family of superconductors and have suggest that they point towards a mechanism of superconductivity that is based on electron-electron repulsion. Our main point is that utilizing the two fold orbital degeneracy at the fermi level and unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion, doped electrons get self organized into arrays of doped Mott chains or a quantum liquid or isotropic 2d RVB staates. We have called them Wigner crystal supported RVB states. Superconductivity, within our theory, can be either isotropic 2d or anisotropic 2d Kosterlitz-Thouless state. In the isotropic (melted Wigner crystal) scenario order parameter symmetry is a gapful dxy symmetry; in the anisotropic (doped Mott Hubbard chain array) scenario we have a gapful extended-S symmetry. We made an accurate estimate of energy of the vatiational state, using known exact results from Lieb and Wu for 1d repulsive Hubbard model. Rest of the conclusions, including a possible second phase containing plaquette bond resonances logically follow from this starting point. Our work at the moment is semi quantitative and suggestive. It needs to be addressed more quantitatively. The novel scenario and a theory we have presented, that emphasizes importance of unscreened coulomb interactions in doped band insulators, is encouraging from the point of reaching higher superconducting Tc's in this s-p, non transition metal based system. We hope it will raise debates, initiate further work and be of assistance to experimentalists to engineer synthesize of new members of the family, having reduced competing orders and higher superconducting Tc.",section_header_strict,"IX.

True,"We examined the crystal structure of a new thermoelectric material family, LaOBiS2-xSex, using powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Upon substitution, Se selectively occupies the in-plane Ch1 site. Although the Se substitution induces buckling of the Bi-Ch1 plane, its intensification results in the enhancement of the metallic conductivity and thermoelectric power factor. We explained that the enhancement of the power factor was attained owing to the increased in-plane chemical pressure. To investigate the origin of the low thermal conductivity of LaOBiSSe, we analysed the high-temperature crystal structure and atomic displacement parameters. LaOBiSSe exhibits anisotropic thermal expansion. Below 473 K, only the a-axis expands, while both a-axis and c-axis expand above 473 K. We revealed anomalously large atomic displacement parameters (Uiso) for the Bi and Ch atoms in the Bi-Ch1 plane. The temperature dependences of Uiso suggest that the temperature evolutions of the atomic vibrations of the Bi-Ch1 plane in the BiCh2 layers are anomalous and similar to that of the rattling atoms in a cage structure. The anisotropic analysis of the atomic displacement parameters (U11 and U33) for the in-plane Bi and Ch1 sites suggests that Bi atoms exhibit large atomic displacement along the c-axis direction, which should presumably be the origin of the low thermal conductivity in LaOBiSSe. In addition, we assume that the large Bi and Ch1 vibrations are related to the in-plane rattling, which is a new strategy for designing low- thermoelectric materials, as observed in Cu atoms of tetrahedrite compounds.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"In this review article, we have surveyed the features of the BiCh2 based superconductors from a theoretical point of view. The BiCh2 based superconductors are a group of layered superconductors constructed from the pyramidal BiCh2 bilayers, and blocking layers having tetragonal structure. In 1112 systems, the electrons can be doped into the BiCh plane with fluorine substitution for oxygen. The conduction bands consist of the p orbitals within the BiCh plane. The conduction bands and the Fermi surface therefore have one dimensional nature with small hoppings along the vertical directions. The irreducible susceptibility is enhanced along the (q, q,0) line due to the Fermi surface nesting and its one dimensional nature. The calculated phonon dispersion in the tetragonal lattice structure also shows the soft phonon modes along the (q, q,0) line. This indicates the presence of strong electron-phonon coupling in these materials. The first principles electronic band calculation results are overall in good agreement with the ARPES experiment, suggesting absence of strong electron correlation as in the 3d-based layered superconductors. On the other hand, there do exist some discrepancies between theory and experiment, whose origin remains to be clarified. The pairing mechanism has been studied in the context of both conventional and unconventional scenarios. Tc values comparable to the experimental observations have been obtained within the phonon-mediated pairing owing to the strong electron-phonon coupling. As for the unconventional pairing, the weak coupling spin-fluctuation calculations omitting the spin-orbit coupling predicts nodal gap functions, while a fully gapped s-wave state is obtained for the J1-J2 local spin model. In a model with spin-orbit coupling, a functional renormalization group study predicts a d*x2-y2-wave pairing, which belongs to the category of the weak topological superconductivity. In this pairing, the triplet and the singlet pairing components are mixed, and the order parameter changes its sign between the disconnected Fermi surfaces. Experimental results also suggest the possibility of charge-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. As surveyed in this review, the BiCh2 based superconductors have interesting features, such as the one dimensional nature of the electronic bands and the Fermi surface nesting, strong electron-phonon coupling, and the strong spin-orbit coupling, which may be entangled in a complex manner. The issue of the pairing mechanism and the pairing symmetry should be closely related to these features. In order to have better understanding on these issues, further theoretical as well as experimental studies are",section_header_strict,4. Conclusion,"necessary.

True,"In summary, we synthesized the Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 polycrystalline sample. The resistivity vanishes below 3.8 K, which together with strong diamagnetic signals in magnetization data, confirming the bulk superconductivity. In contrast to most of the BiS2based compounds where superconductivity is developed from the background of a semiconducting-like normal state, the normal state of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 exhibits a Superconductivity and abnormal pressure effect in Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 superconductor metallic behavior down to Tc. Under magnetic field or pressure, a crossover from metallic to semiconducting behaviors is induced, and the superconductivity is suppressed accordingly. While the Tc decreases with increasing monotonously, the absolute value of the normal state resistivity first decreases and then increases with pressure. All these features are in contrast to the previously known BiS2-based superconductors. While the semiconducting behavior in the normal state of most BiS2 and BiSe2 remains one of the puzzling issue in connection with the unconventional superconductivity, the opposite situation in the present compound, namely, the crossover from the metallic to semiconducting behaviors in the normal in the presence of magnetic field or pressure is rather unusual, pointing to a possible different mechanism of superconductivity in this family of materials. Such feature reminds us of a related single crystal compound Nd(O, F)BiS2[33], where the normal state exhibits the fieldinduced semiconducting behavior above Tc. This feature was attributed to the possible pseudo-gap phase extending to relatively higher temperatures as evidenced by the unusual superconducting fluctuations seen in the scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) experiment[33]. We thus expect that the superconducting mechanism of the present system may be also quite unique and deserve further investigations such as by ARPES, NMR or STS experiments in future.",section_header_strict,4.

Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex with x = 0˗1 were synthesized by solid state reaction method. The XRD and Rietveld analyses revealed that Se selectively occupied at the in-plane Ch1 site, and hence, in-plane chemical pressure was enhanced. For x ≥ 0.6, superconducting transitions with a large shielding volume fraction were observed in -T measurements, and the highest Tc was 3.8 K for x = 0.8. From -T measurements, a zero-resistivity state was observed for all the samples, and the highest Tc was observed for x = 0.8. With increasing Se concentration, characteristics of -T changed from semiconducting-like to metallic, suggesting that the emergence of bulk superconductivity is linked with the enhanced metallicity via in-plane chemical pressure. A superconductivity phase diagram of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex superconductor was established.

True,"The Ce-doping effect on the valence state and local atomic displacement in the EuBiS2F system is investigated by using XAS measurements. First of all, the valence of Eu ions in EuBiS2F is estimated to be about +2.16(1), demonstrating the self-electron-doping nature without any extrinsic doping. Upon 50 at.% Ce-doping, the mean valence of Eu reduces to +2.05(1) and that of Ce ions are essentially trivalent. The main effect of Ce-doping is to provide additional 17% electrons into the system, beneficial for the superconductivity enhancement. The local atomic displacements can be revealed by Eu and Bi L3-edge EXAFS: 1) the in-plane Bi-S1 distance is characterized by a large configurational disorder in EuBiS2F-based system, which is quite common in BiS2-based superconductors; 2) both the shortening of the in-plane Bi-S1 bond (i. e. a higher in-plane chemical pressure) and the flatter Bi-S1 plane are responsible for an enhancement of superconductivity. In summary, we established a relationship between Ce-doping and the Tc enhancement in EuBiS2F-based superconductors, in terms of valence changes and nanoscale atomic displacements. The new findings are promising for providing insights on the interplay of charge, local structure and superconductivity.

True,"we have established a superconductivity phase diagram of LaO1-xFxBiSSe with information about the crystal structure and the normal-state transport characteristics. In an ideal BiCh2-based compound with less in-plane disorder, metallic transport and superconductivity are suddenly induced by a small amount of electron doping. For LaO1-xFxBiSSe, superconductivity is induced in both monoclinic and tetragonal structures. In addition, the electron-doping dependence of Tc exhibits an anomalously flat phase diagram. The intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based compounds should be useful for understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the system. In conclusion, we have investigated the crystal structure and the physical properties of LaO1-xFxBiSSe to reveal the intrinsic superconductivity phase diagram of the BiCh2-based compounds. From synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements with anisotropic displacement parameters for LaO1-xFxBiSSe and LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-ySey, we revealed that the essence of in-plane chemical pressure effect was the suppression of the local in-plane disorder in the BiCh2 layers. The in-plane disorder causes the absence of metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity in typical REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Since the in-plane disorder was fully suppressed for all x in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, this system is one of the most ideal system to discuss the intrinsic nature of the emergence of superconductivity in the BiCh2-based compounds.

This linear relationship between lattice constants and Se content is different from that of related compounds, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex.

True,"the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 has been examined using neutron powder diffraction and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The structural refinements revealed that two metal sites, M1 and M2 sites, were differently surrounded by sulfur atoms. Furthermore, we found site selectivity of Bi and Pb in the LaOBiPbS3 structure. The structural characteristics around the M1 and the M2 site are close to the Bi site of LaOBiS2 and the M2 site are close to the Pb site of rock-salt-type PbS, respectively. These results suggested that the crystal structure of LaOBiPbS3 can be regarded as alternate stacks of the Pb-rich PbS-type layers and the Bi-rich LaOBiS2-type layers. From band calculations for an ideal (LaOBiS2)(PbS) system, we found that the S bands of the PbS layer are hybridized with the Bi bands of the BiS plane at around the Fermi energy, which results in the electronic characteristics different from that of LaOBiS2.

True,"Lastly, we discuss the SC gap symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. Our measurements of Ce(T, H) suggest that a single SC gap is fully opened. µSR measurements of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 show multiple SC gap. Specific heat measurement is insensitive to light bands, because Ce(T )/T at low temperatures is proportional to N(E). It is likely that contribution from minor bands, which is not detected from specific heat can be seen in µSR measurements. Theoretically, the candidates of SC gap symmetry are proposed as follows: the conventional swave, spin triplet p, and d-wave symmetries. Although specific heat measurements imply that the superconductivity is fully gapped, d-wave symmetry can be realized in the disconnect Fermi surfaces. The Fermi surface of the Se-doped compound is not elucidated at this stage. Assuming that the Fermi surface of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe contains disconnected small electron pockets at the Brillouin Zone boundary, such as the under doped Nd(O, F)BiS2, dxy symmetry is ruled out and dx2-y2 symmetry can be realized. In addition, in the case of an increase in the Sedoped value, which changes into the Fermi surface with hole pockets around the Γ point, s± symmetry can be realized. However, the emergence of unconventional superconductivity with sign reversal change is unlikely. Mean free path ℓab is calculated from ℓab = µ0vab F λ2 ab(0)/ρ0. Fermi velocity vF is estimated to be 0.11 × 106 m/s by using the relationship ξab = 0.18(ℏvab F /kBTc). We obtain ℓab ∼10 nm, which is clearly shorter than ξab. The result suggests that superconductivity is in dirty limit. As superconductivity with sign-reversal change is very sensitive to impurity scattering, it is likely that nodal d-wave state cannot be realized in the Se-doped compound. In the case of s±-wave state seen in Fe-based superconductors, the robustness against the impurities should be proved in a more complete way, because simple substitution effect could be insufficient to reveal signreversal change in SC gap. Since distinct multi-gap feature can be detected from specific heat measurements of the Fe-based superconductors[34, 35], the effective mass of minor bands is significantly large. However, singlegap structure detected in the Ce(T, H) measurements of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe indicates that the mass of the minor bands is negligible. Therefore, we suggest that the swave structure can be the best candidate for the SC-gap symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. IV. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, to confirm bulk superconductivity and reveal the SC-gap symmetry of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, specific heat measurements were performed using a hand-made sensitive calorimeter. Specific heat measurement shows that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is of bulk nature. A large specific heat jump (∆Ce/γTc = 2.31) shows strong electron-phonon coupling. 2∆(0)/kBTc obtained from the T -dependence of the electronic specific heat Ce(T ) below Tc is 4.5, and suggests strong electron- phonon coupling. The value is much smaller than that obtained from STM measurements (2∆/kBTc ∼17)[14]. T - and H-dependences of the specific heat measurements imply that superconductivity of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe is fully gapped. These results are consistent with the s-wave symmetry proposed for the SC state of BiS2-based superconductors.",section_header_strict,"III.

This trend is very similar to those observed for Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5BiS2xSex and Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2-xSex. Therefore, the emergence of bulk superconductivity upon the suppression of the in-plane disorder at the Ch1 sites seems to be a universal scenario for the BiCh2based superconductors.

True,"In summary, the observed phenomena including suppression and broadening of the superconducting transition, changes of the normal state resistivity with pressure, and the dramatic changes in the normal state electron conduction behavior between 0.42-0.95 GPa strongly suggest a pressure-induced phase transition in the La1-xM xOBiS2 compounds. In contrast to the pressure-induced low-Tc to high Tc phase transitions reported in F-containing BiS2 superconductors, the highpressure phase observed in this work does not favor superconductivity. The results suggest that fluorine plays a critical role for the pressure-induced enhancement of Tc for BiS2-based compounds. For the low-pressure phase, anomalies in the normal state resistivity, which seem to be pressure dependent, were observed in the pressure range from 0.24 to 0.45 GPa. Another unusual phenomenon observed in this study is the tendency toward more semiconducting behavior with increasing pressure in the high-pressure phase.

True,"we have investigated the interaction between the HE states of the REO blocking layer, the local structure of the electrically conducting BiS2 layer and the superconducting properties of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. The samples with lattice parameters close to PrO0.5F0.5BiS2 (or CeO0.5F0.5BiS2) and largely different mixing entropy (Smix) for the RE site were synthesized by changing the number of RE elements contained in the REO blocking layer. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinements, the crystal structure parameters, including anisotropic displacement parameters, were investigated. The increase in Smix does not largely affect the bond lengths and the bond angle of the BiS2 conducting layer but clearly suppresses the in-plane disorder at the in-plane S1 site [U11 (S1)], which is the parameter essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the REO0.5F0.5BiS2 system. As expected, bulk nature of superconductivity, shielding volume fraction in the superconducting states, is enhanced by the increase in Smix. The present results clearly show that the increase in mixing entropy at the blocking layer can positively affect the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the conducting layer while these layers can be regarded as spatially-separated. The evidence of the interaction between the HE states of the blocking layer, the local structure conducting layer, and the physical properties of the material should be a novel strategy useful to design new layered materials and to enhance the functionality using the concept of high entropy alloy.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",Acknowledgements,1572,232,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1808.04090v2_full.txt,1808.04090v2_full.txt,
True,"Since the discovery of superconductivity in the BiS2-based layered compounds Bi4O4S3 and LaO1-xFxBiS2, much efforts have been made toward the material development and clarification of the mechanisms of superconductivity. In addition, for the BiS2-related compounds, the functional properties of thermoelectric, spin, optical, and photocatalytic materials have also been investigated in related compounds. As summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I, various types of crystal structure and compositions have been investigated. The crystal structure of the BiS2-based compounds is composed of alternately stacked BiS2 conducting (superconducting) layers and blocking (insulating) layers such as LaO or EuF. The stacking structure is similar to those of the cuprate and Fe-based superconductors. A low-dimensional electronic structure is realized, and the electronic and structural properties can be easily manipulated by element substitution and/or pressure effects, which is the merit of layered systems. The parent phase of BiS2-based superconductors is an insulator with a band gap. Since the conduction band is composed of Bi 6p orbitals hybridized with S 3p, electron doping is required to obtain a metallic character. For example, electron-doped LaO1-xFxBiS2 shows superconductivity, but the superconducting states for the as-grown sample of LaO1xFxBiS2 are not bulk in nature. To induce bulk superconductivity, the optimization of the local crystal structure is important. High pressure can stabilize the monoclinic structure of LaO1-xFxBiS2 and induces bulk superconductivity. In addition, the chemical pressure effect by RE substitution or Se substitution can also induce bulk superconductivity in REO1-xFxBiCh2. The in-plane chemical pressure is universally essential for the emergence of bulk superconductivity in the BiS2-based systems. The in-plane chemical pressure suppresses the in-plane disorder of S atoms, which intrinsically exists in the BiS2-based compounds. Now, we know a method of inducing bulk superconductivity by carrier doping and structural optimization. Therefore, the next stage is the complete understanding of the mechanisms of superconductivity in the BiS2-based family. There are still contradictory results on the mechanisms. Further measurements on well-designed compositions with various probes and integrated discussion are required. Finally, let us mention the possibility of a higher Tc in the BiS2-based systems. As shown in Fig. 4(b), small signals with a higher Tc (higher than the bulk Tc) have been observed in some compounds. In addition, as reported by Liu et al., giant superconducting fluctuations were observed from STS. Therefore, further material development is required. We believe that a high Tc can be obtained by realizing the optimized condition (possibly extremely compressed local Bi-S bonding).",section_header_strict,7.

True,"Suppression of resistivity anomaly by the Sn substitution Here, we discuss the possible origin of the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. As revealed in the crystal structure part, the lattice parameters were not largely affected by the Sn substitution. Therefore, in-plane chemical pressure amplitude in the Bi-S superconducting plane, which has been revealed as the essential parameter for the emergence of superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds [24], should not be significantly changed. Therefore, we consider that the in-plane chemical pressure effect is not the origin for the increase in Tc by the Sn substitution. On carrier concentration, the absolute value of the Seebeck coefficient slightly decreases by Sn substitution for x = 0.1-0.4, which can be corresponding to the slight increase in electron carriers by Sn substitution. However, the large increase in Tc for x = 0.4 may not be understood from the increase in carrier concentration only because the difference in carrier concentration between x = 0.1 (Tc = 0.6 K) and x = 0.4 (Tc = 2.3 K) is expected to be quite small. On the basis of these facts, we briefly mention about the possible relation to the CDW ordering and the possible scenario of the suppression of CDW by Sn substitution in this system. In the -T plots, an anomaly was observed in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system. A similar feature in the normal-state resistivity has been observed in the EuFBiS2 superconductor (Tc = 0.3 K). The origin of the hump was proposed as a CDW transition [29]. We assume that the suppression of the CDW ordering is the origin for the increased Tc in La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6. In addition, the anomaly temperature T* was shifted to a lower temperature by Sn substitution, and the anomaly disappeared at x = 0.3. At around x = 0.3 and 0.4, Tc is the maximum. These facts imply that Tc increased by the suppression of T*. Although we have no evidence for the CDW states in the La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 system and the suppression mechanism by the Sn substitution, introduction of randomness at the M2 site may be effective to suppress the charge ordering states. Bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 As shown in the Result part, a partial Se substitution for S induced bulk superconductivity in La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3. Although the solubility limit is very low (5%), the lattice parameters clearly changed by the partial Se substitution, and the superconducting properties were significantly improved. Although we refined three models with different Se site (assuming the substitution at the S1, S2, or S3 sites), we could not find the site selectivity of doped Se. However, we expect that the doped Se occupies the Ch1 site in the inset of Fig. 6. In previous reports on the Se substitution in BiS2-based compounds, the site selectivity of Se at the in-plane site was observed [24,32,33]. According to the relationship between in-plane disorder at the chalcogen site and superconductivity in BiS2-based systems [16,24], we assume that Se substitution reduced the inplane disorder at the S1 site and induced bulk superconductivity. Furthermore, the roomtemperature Seebeck coefficient for the La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3 sample was similar to those shown in Fig. 4 (S = -25 V/K). This also suggests that the bulk nature of superconductivity was induced by local structural optimization but not due to changes in carrier concentration. Since we have reported the emergence of bulk superconductivity in La2O2M4S6-type layered oxychalcogenide La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S5.7Se0.3, we can expect material development in related fourlayer-type oxychalcogenide superconductors. Recently, a new superconductor Bi3O2S2Cl with the one-layer-type superconducting layer was discovered by Ruan et al. [34]. In Fig. 8, schematic images of typical one-layer-type (Fig. 8a), two-layer-type (Fig. 8b), and four-layer-type (Fig. 8c) are displayed for comparison. All the materials have the similar RE2O2 or Bi2O2 blocking layer. By changing the constituent elements in the superconducting layers, the thickness can be changed in this superconductor family. On the basis of these facts, we expect further development of materials with these crystal structures or novel materials with a superconducting layer with a different thickness (number of the superconducting layers in a unit cell).

Methods The polycrystalline samples of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6 with x = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 were prepared by a solid-state reaction method. The polycrystalline samples of Se-substituted La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez with z = 0.3 and 0.6 were also prepared by a solid-state reaction method. Powders (or grains) of Bi2O3 (99.9%), La2S3 (99.9%), Sn (99.99%), and AgO (99.9%) and grains of Bi (99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.99%) with a nominal composition of La2O2Bi3Ag1-xSnxS6zSez were mixed in a pestle and mortar, pelletized, sealed in an evacuated quartz tube, and heated in an electric furnace. The heat treatment condition was 725 °C for 15 h for both samples. However, for La2O2Bi3Ag0.6Sn0.4S6-zSez, heating the sample to 725 °C in 1 h was needed to suppress the generation of impurity phases. The obtained samples were reground for homogeneity, pelletized, and heated in the same procedure. The phase purity of the prepared samples and the optimal annealing conditions were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu-Kα radiation. The lattice parameters were determined using the Rietveld method with RIETAN-FP [35]. Schematic image of the crystal structure was drawn using VESTA [36]. The actual composition was analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) on scanning electron microscope TM3030 (Hitachi). The magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out using a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer (MPMS-3, Quantum Design). The susceptibility data were taken after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ρ(T)] was measured by four-terminal method on the Physical Property measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design). The resistivity measurement down to 0.4 K was measured using a 3He probe platform of PPMS. The ADR system on PPMS was used for resistivity measurements down to 0.1 K. For clarity, we labeled the examined samples with the nominal compositions.

We observed two-fold symmetry of the c-axis magnetoresistance in the ab plane of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe while the conducting plane possessed a tetragonal square plane with four-fold symmetry. We consider that the observed in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis magnetoresistance would be due to electronic (or orbital) origins and not due to structural origins. The observed two-fold symmetry is possibly related to the nematic states, which have been observed in the superconducting states of several unconventional superconductors with a layered structure.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,","6

True,"HP strongly enhances two-dimensionality in LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2. The associated reduction in long-range order along the direction of stacking of Bi(Se/S)2 and LaO/F layers induces formation of stacking faults. The HP SCII LaO1-xFxBiSe2 phase better preserves long-range order of the parent SCI phase compared to the S-containing one. This is evident from a more homogeneous structure of diffuse rods for LaO1-xFxBiS2 and, therefore, this system is characterized by weaker interlayer interactions which results in lower SCI-SCII transition pressure. Studied LaO1-xFxBi(Se/S)2 systems illustrate how structural two-dimensionality is critical for layered superconductors. Targeted enhancement of 2D-structure of layered systems either by external (pressure, temperature) or internal (chemical doping, substitutions) means should be considered as another pathway to further improve their superconducting performance.",section_header_strict,Conclusions,Acknowledgments,909,118,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/1908.05961v2_full.txt,1908.05961v2_full.txt,
True,"we succeeded in growing a single crystal of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). Platelike single crystals with dimensions of 0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3 were obtained. We discovered bulk superconductivity at Tc = 4.7 K in a compound with x = 0.2. The lattice constant of the c-axis decreased with an increase in Ce content x. The shrinking of the c-axis indicated the mixed valency of Ce3+/Ce4+. It is likely that the superconductivity of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was induced by the electron doping of the mixed valence of Ce3+/Ce4+. The superconducting transition temperature of Ce-substituted Nd1-xCexOBiS2 was slightly lower than that of F-substituted NdO1-xFxBiS2. This tendency is also observed in Ce-substituted La1-xCexOBiSSe and Ce1-xPrxOBiS2. ρ(T) of Nd1-xCexOBiS2 showed a metallic behavior. In a compound with x = 0.5, a broad hump was observed in ρ(T) at approximately 80 K, similar to that found in CeOBiS2. The electrical resistivity of ρ(6 K) and ρ(280 K) increased with increasing x. The tendency of S can be understood by the increase of the Ce4+ ratio with decreasing Ce content below x = 0.5. The upper critical field µ0Hc2(T) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 was determined to be ∼12 T for H || ab and ∼0.34 T for H || c-axis. The anisotropic parameter Γ was estimated to be ∼35, which was comparable to that of F-doped NdOBiS2. The µ0Hc2(0) of the Ce-doped NdOBiS2 was approximately two times smaller than that of the F-doped one, although the difference of Γ was approximately 10. The results imply that the µ0Hc2(0) for both directions reduces in superconductivity induced by Ce-doping.

True,"La2O2Bi2Pb2S6 is a four-layer-type Bi-based compound that shows insulating transport properties at low temperatures. Hence, in this study, we have investigated the effects of Se substitution on the structural, transport, and superconducting properties of La2O2Bi2Pb2S6-xSex. Owing to Se doping, the normal state electrical resistivity at low temperatures was drastically suppressed, and superconductivity at a transition temperature (Tc) of 1.15 K was observed for x = 0.5. Tc increased with increasing Se concentration: Tc = 1.9 K for x = 1.0. According to XRD analyses, we proposed that Se was substituted for the in-plane S1 site in the BiS2 layers. Both the Seebeck coefficient and the Hall coefficient suggested that electrons were the dominant carriers. From the Hall coefficient, carrier concentration was estimated. Owing to Se substitution, the concentration of mobile carriers increased considerably; this could be related to the suppression of carrier localization caused by Se substitution. On the basis of the obtained results and the discussion based on the analogy of two-layer-type systems, the emergence of metallicity and superconductivity was explained by the in-plane chemical pressure effects. The estimated Bc2(0) was 0.76 and 1.15 T for x = 0.5 and 1.0, respectively.

True,"In this section, we discuss the relationship between external pressure effects, chemical pressure effects, and evolution of superconductivity in Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2. On comparing the evolutions of superconductivity for RE = Ce-Sm and that for RE = La, a slight decrease in Tc for the low-P phase was observed with increasing pressure for the RE = Ce, Pr, Nd and, Sm samples. This deviation in the behaviour might be explained by the effect of coexistence of both the external as well as chemical pressures25. Moreover, we observed that the Tc of the high-P phase varied slightly with the RE ionic radius. On the contrary, the Pc for the high-P phase increased with decreasing RE ionic radius. Specifically, assuming a coordination number of 8, Pc was roughly estimated as 0.95, 1.11, 1.17, and 1.33 GPa for La3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.16 Å), Ce3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.14 Å), Pr3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.13 Å), and Nd3+ (with an ionic radius of 1.11 Å), respectively. The tendency of the increase in Pc and the decrease in Tc with a decrease in RE ionic radius was also observed for REO0.5F0.5BiS2 compounds38,39,40; specifically, the Tc varied from approximately 10 K to 6 K, and a significantly higher Pc was required with decreasing RE ionic radius. These observations highlight the relationship between the structural transition to monoclinic and the packing density in the BiS2 conducting layers34. It is possible that the larger space along the BiS conduction plane with a larger RE ionic radius possibly transmits the pressure, thereby inducing structural transition. As shown in Fig. 6, Tcmag of all samples for the low- and high-P phases were plotted with respect to the lattice constant a. Tc of the high-P phase was defined as the highest Tc for the range of applied pressures, whereas Tc of the low-P phase was defined as the value of Tc when the applied pressure is lower than the pressure for the emergency of the high-P phase. A slightly increasing trend in Tc was observed for both lowand high-P phases with increasing lattice constant a estimated under an ambient pressure. Fig. 7 (a) presents the X-ray diffraction patterns of Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2 at room temperature under various applied pressures of up to 3.4 GPa. Shifts of the (001) and (004) peaks to higher angles clearly indicate the shrinkage of the lattice along the c-axis due to the pressure. In contrast, a relatively smaller shift of the (110) peak was detected, which indicates that the in-plane size remains almost unchanged. Strong peak broadening was observed for the (200) peak above 1.1 GPa, indicating peak splitting due to the lowering of in-plane structural symmetry. Similar peak splitting on the (200) peak was observed for isostructural LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and EuFBiS2 samples under high pressure34,35,41, and a resultant structural transition from a tetragonal to monoclinic phase was detected. We noticed that the (200) peak asymmetrically split into two or more peaks, as depicted in Fig. 7 (b). This may be due to the inhomogeneity of applied pressure and the flexible nature of the in-plane structure of BiS2-based compounds. The critical pressure of 1.1 GPa estimated from the XRD corresponds satisfactorily with the Pc estimated from the magnetization measurements. Conclusion Herein, we report on the results of the crystal structure, resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility under pressure for (Sr, RE)FBiS2 (RE: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, and Sm). The effects of external pressure on magnetization resulted in abrupt increments in Tc up to 10-10.8 K, for samples with RE = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd. Based on analyses of the shielding volume fraction estimated via magnetic susceptibility measurements, we found that two bulk superconductivity phases (low-P and high-P phases) existed for (Sr, RE)FBiS2. The common features were that the bulk low-P phase was induced by external pressure, whereas the bulk high-P phase was induced at pressures exceeding a critical pressure. Moreover, at the critical pressure, Tc sharply increased to the high-P phase as our experiment shifted to higher pressures with decreasing RE ionic radius; this implied that both the external as well as chemical pressures were affecting Tc. In addition, we investigated the variations in the crystal structure under pressure. By analysing the splitting of the (200) peak, we concluded that the high-P phase was a monoclinic structure. Various bulk superconducting phases with different space group induced via external pressure effects in (Sr, RE)FBiS2 need to be further investigated in order to elucidate the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based systems.

The mixed powder was subsequently pelletized, sintered in an evacuated quartz tube at 700oC for 20 hours, followed by furnace cooling to room temperature. The obtained compounds were thoroughly mixed and ground, then sintered in the same conditions at the first sintering.

Hydrostatic pressures were generated by the MPMS high pressure Capsule Cell. The sample was immersed in a pressure transmitting medium (Daphene 7373) covered with a Teflon cell.

Also, the in-plane anisotropy of the electrical resistance was investigated using a 3He probe equipped with a two-axes rotator system to investigate the in-plane anisotropy of magnetoresistance. From the in-plane anisotropy measurements, we observed two-fold symmetry of magnetoresistance in the superconducting states within the ab plane of LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe. Since the crystal possessed a tetragonal square plane with a tetragonal (four-fold) in-plane symmetry, the appearance of twofold symmetry indicates the rotational symmetry breaking in the superconducting states. The phenomena are very similar to those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe with a higher electron doping concentration. Therefore, we conclude that the carrier doping concentration, which affects the Fermi surface topology, is not an essential parameter for the emergence of the nematicsuperconductivity-like phenomena in LaO1-xFxBiSSe.

True,"We have investigated the in-plane anisotropy of the c-axis MR in both superconducting and normal states of single crystals of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 under in-plane magnetic fields. In the superconducting states, four-fold-symmetric in-plane anisotropy of MR was observed below the Tc. Since the crystal structure of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 is tetragonal, the results suggest no symmetry breaking in the in-plane anisotropy of MR in the superconducting states. This is clearly different from those observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe single crystals, in which two-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR was observed in its superconducting states. We consider that the switching between twofold-symmetric and four-fold-symmetric anisotropy of MR in the superconducting properties of those systems is related to the constituent elements at the superconducting planes, which is expected to modify the spin-orbit interactions. In the normal states of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, two-fold symmetric MR with a small amplitude was observed, while four-fold-symmetric anisotropy was observed in the normal states of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe.

True,"As summarised in Fig. 1, isotope effect suggesting the importance of phonon was observed for the high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2, whereas unconventional isotope effects were observed in La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S326,27. Although there are some possible factors, which could affect isotope effect, other than pairing states32, we consider that the observed difference in isotope effect is essentially caused by the different pairing states between those systems. The reason for proposing the scenario is the recent observation of nematic superconductivity in La(O, F)BiSSe33,34; nematic superconductivity has been observed in unconventional superconductors like Fe-based and Bi2Se3-based superconductors35,36. Since nematic superconductivity emerges in both LaO0.9F0.1BiSSe (tetragonal) and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (tetragonal) with different carrier concentrations but with comparable structures of the BiSSe conducting layer, unconventional pairing states would commonly present in tetragonal BiCh2-based superconductors with a tetragonal symmetry without structural distortion or local disorder. In contrast, nematic superconductivity was not observed in Nd(O, F)BiS237, which is also tetragonal but has larger local structural disorder than La(O, F)BiSSe11,17,19. These facts suggest the importance of structural symmetry in the conducting layers and would support our scenario suggested in this article. Here, we discuss the possible differences in electronic states and pairing states between tetragonal and monoclinic phases. The high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2 has a monoclinic structure and a distorted in-plane structure in the BiS2 layers30. In contrast, La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3 have tetragonal structures, in which the square Bi-Ch network forms a superconducting plane. Although the low-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2 is tetragonal, same as for La(O, F)BiSSe and Bi4O4S3, bulk superconductivity is not observed at ambient pressure because of insufficient in-plane chemical pressure17-19,30. In the low pressure range, bulk superconductivity is induced, but the determination of Tc is difficult because there are two possible superconducting transitions of the manometer (Pb) and the high-P phase. Based on the isotope effects in the high-P phase of (Sr, La)FBiS2, La(O, F)BiSSe, and Bi4O4S3, we suggest that structural symmetry breaking in the superconducting BiCh2 layer is an essential factor in the switching of the isotope effect from unconventional to conventional.

True,"In this chapter, we reviewed the works on HEA superconductors and HEA-type superconducting compounds, which have been developed applying the HEA concept in simple alloys to more complicated compounds. By introducing a HEA-type site (or alloying multi sites) in a compound, a high mixing entropy can be achieved. HEA-type compounds would have a high mixing entropy at the alloyed site and a highly (randomly) disordered bonding states. For a three-dimensional system, such as NaCl-type chalcogenides, introduction of the HEA-type M site in MCh resulted in suppression of Tc, but, at the same time, slight enhancements of Hc2 and Jc were observed. For tetragonal (CuAl2-type) TrZr2, the introduction of the HEA-type site does not suppress Tc. Furthermore, for layered systems, such as REBa2Cu3O7-d cuprates and BiS2-based RE0.5F0.5BiS2, high-entropy alloying rather improves their superconducting properties. Through investigations of the HEA effects to superconducting and structural properties for HEA-type compounds with different structural types, we conclude that the HEA effects are highly depending on the structural dimensionality. Hence, to effectively use the HEA effect to improve superconducting properties of compounds, target structure should be lower-symmetric, a layered structure or a one-dimensional structure. To obtain further knowledge about the presence/absence of local phase separations, pinning characteristics, and the HEA effect to superconducting pairing states, further investigations on HEA-type superconducting compounds using various probes are required.",section_header_strict,6.

True,"Here we report that NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.37 and 0.3) develops a CDW, a long-sought structural ground state in the BiS2-based superconductors that coexist with superconductivity. The origin of a CDW is an interesting and often challenging question. It can be from FSN as in simple Pierels system, q-dependent electron-phonon coupling as in some TMDC, or electron-electron correlation in cuprates55. While the QCDW seems to be far from the FSN vectors known so far, electron-phonon coupling calculations were not successful to predict the wavevector yet. More careful studies considering the interlayer couplings and even electronic correlations could be required. The discrepancy between the calculations and measurements might be from the structural instability to the monoclinic phase in the BiS2-based system. At high pressure, LaO1-xFxBiS2 undergoes a structural phase transition to P21/m and yields higher Tc28. According to the first-principle calculations, in the monoclinic phase, the magnitude of the interlayer hopping becomes much larger stabilizing the electronic state56,57. Our intensity map at (H, K, 0) in the Supplementary show that the xray reflections no longer satisfy the P4/nmm extinction conditions, probably due to a monoclinic phase transition as observed in some other BiS2-based systems58. The enhanced interlayer hopping in the monoclinic structure, therefore, can be responsible for the L-dependence of our CDW wavevector. We claim that the interlayer coupling overlooked so far in the phonon and band calculations can be essential to properly describe the electron-phonon coupling, FSN, CDW, and the nature of superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors. Lastly, the role of CDW in superconductivity has been an active research subject since Fr¨ohlich tried to explain superconductivity with sliding of CDW, a concept conceived even before BCS formalism59. While there is accumulating evidence that a CDW could be a ubiquitous phase in unconventional superconductors23,24, the relation with superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we suggested that the charge density wave and superconductivity might be in competition while coexisting over a certain doping range in the phase diagram. Like lattice vibrations in a conventional superconductor, charge/orbital fluctuation near the quantum critical point is argued to be capable of mediating superconductivity. Considering the absence of momentum- and temperature- dependent anomalies in the phonon spectrum across Tc, we cannot exclude the unconventional pairing mechanism. The study on the interplay between CDW and superconductivity in BiS2-based superconductors, by changing external perturbations like doping or pressure will be a fascinating topic that requires lots of future attention. V. CONCLUSION In summary, we found an intrinsic and long-range CDW phase in a NdO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.37 and 0.3) superconductor by x-ray diffraction measurements. The CDW wavevector is QCDW ≈(0.17, 0.17, 0.5) with clear L-dependence and the atomic displacements are transverse and in diagonal directions. The wavevector does not match theoretical estimations from phonon softening or FSN and therefore places an important constraint on forthcoming studies. We measured TDS across the Tc and could not find meaningful q- and T- dependent changes.",section_header_strict,"IV.

True,"We have successfully grown Sm(O, F)BiS2 single crystals with the nominal compositions of SmO1-xFxBiS2 (x = 0.3-0.8) using KI-KCl flux. The solid solution limit of F at the O site is approximately less than 20 at%. The difference of c-axis lattice constants could not be observed in the all samples. But analytical F contents were similar value which was approximately 20 at% F substitution in O-site. Therefore, Sm(O, F)BiS2 with approximately 20 at% F substitution has possibility to be of intrinsic stable phase. In consequence, F concentrations and c-axis lattice constants are hardly controlled by nominal F contents. On the other hand, the peak shape of associated absorption-edge spectra for Sm was almost the same between x = 0.3 and 0.5, which was mainly trivalent electronic configuration (Sm3+). Superconducting transition temperature were increased with increasing nominal F contents within less than x = 0.7 despite similar chemical properties. The upper critical fields and superconducting anisotropies showed no remarkable tendencies regardless of the various nominal F contents within x = 0.3-0.8 range.

The dependence of γG on in-plane chemical pressure exhibits a good correlation with Tc, and a higher Tc is achieved when γG is large for RE = Nd.

True,"4-1. Correlation between superconductivity and anharmonicity According to BCS theory, a high phonon energy is preferred for a higher Tc, as revealed in MgB2 [45] and hydride superconductors [46-48]. The target system of this study is BiCh2-based compounds, in which the Bi p electrons contribute to electronic conduction and, hence, superconducting pairing. Because of the heavy Bi atoms, a high phonon energy cannot be expected in BiCh2-based compounds, and a theoretical study suggested that several-K Tc in tetragonal RE(O, F)BiS2 cannot be understood using conventional phonon-mediated models [25]. In addition, the absence of isotope effects on the S or Se sites has been confirmed in tetragonal Bi4O4S3 and La(O, F)BiSSe [16,18]. Therefore, the pairing mechanisms of superconductivity in tetragonal BiCh2-based compounds are different from conventional phonon-mediated weak-coupling superconductivity. Here, we discuss the relationship between the anharmonic atomic vibrations and superconductivity in BiCh2-based compounds. In caged compounds, the increase in anharmonicity in the rattling mode (low-energy optical-phonon mode) results in the enhancement of strong-coupling superconductivity and an increase in Tc [33,49]. If the pairing in BiCh2-based systems is mediated by the rattling of Bi, the absence of the isotope effect for the S or Se sites can be explained. In Fig. 6, Tcs of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd) are plotted as functions of γG. As mentioned above, no clear correlation between Tc and γG was observed for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex, which could be due to the constant γG at x = 0.4-1.0. However, we find that Tc increases with increasing γG for Se-free and Se-poor samples, as highlighted by the green curve in Fig. 6, after the addition of the data points of REO0.5F0.5BiS2. Here, we excluded x = 0 because the susceptibility does not show bulk superconductivity signals. What is the origin of the large γG, which suggests large anharmonicity in the system? We consider that the onedimensional rattling-like vibrations of Bi atoms along the c-axis contribute to their anharmonicity. Indeed, the softening of these rattling modes was detected using γG in thermoelectric LaOBi(S, Se)2 [29,32]. Therefore, the increase in γG in superconducting REO0.5F0.5BiCh2 with Se-poor compositions is possibly linked to softening of the low-energy phonon mode of Bi in the BiCh2 layers. In the current work, we cannot clarify the cause of the deviation in the data points for the Se-rich samples in Fig. 6, but it would be related to the changes in superconducting states (and/or the influence of anharmonicity on superconductivity) because Se substitution at the Ch1 site largely modifies the chemical bonding and electronic states [10,15]. In addition, we discuss possible changes in characteristics of anharmonic vibration by Se substitution. 4-2. Low-energy phonons Because the discussion above assumes an anharmonic rattling-like vibration in superconducting REO0.5F0.5BiCh2, we examined the presence of low-energy optical phonons in these samples using the specific heat. We performed low-temperature specific heat measurements for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex and LaOBiS2-ySey (thermoelectric phase). In materials with low-energy optical phonons, a peak is expected in the plot at a temperature corresponding to approximately a fifth of the phonon energy [50,51]. Because the phonon energy observed in inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is 6-7 meV for LaOBiS2-ySey [32], we expected a peak at approximately 12-14 K. As shown in Fig. S8(a) (Supplemental Materials [43]), the specific heat analysis results for LaOBiS2-ySey confirmed the evolution of a peak structure and the softening of the optical phonon [decrease in peak temperature (Tp)] by Se substitution, which is consistent with the INS results [32]. The analysis results for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are summarized in Fig. 7(a), where (C-γT)/T3 is plotted as functions of temperature. Similar peaks were observed at 12.4-13.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. The peak temperatures were determined by taking the temperature differential of the polynomial-fitting results. The peaks are evidence of low-energy phonon modes in superconducting LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. In addition, the peak temperatures for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex are clearly lower than Tp = 14.0 K for LaOBiS2 (y = 0) [see Fig. S8(b)], implying the enhanced anharmonicity by F substitution. Based on the difference in γG, we expected a lower Tp at x = 0.8 than that at x = 0.2, but the obtained results did not corroborate this expectation. Although we have no explanation for this trend, one possible cause is the difference in local structural disorder in samples with lower in-plane CP (e. g., at x = 0 and 0.2). The change in local structure may affect Tp. Furthermore, from Fig. 7(b), we find that the optical phonon energy decreases with Se substitution for x ≤ 0.4, but it increases for further Se substitution for x = 0.6-1.0. However, we noticed that the contributions of optical phonon in (C-γT)/T3 is large at x = 0.8 and 1.0. The large (C-γT)/T3 values than β (see Table I) is linked to the enhanced anharmonicity as revealed in Ref. 51. Therefore, the weak hardening at x = 0.6- 1.0 would be related to the changes in the shape of the interatomic potential and/or optical phonon characteristics. The results on γG and (C-γT)/T3 would be suggesting the importance of anharmonicity on superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex. To further understand the correlation between superconductivity and anharmonicity (rattling-like Bi vibration) in BiCh2based superconductors, further studies using various probes, including INS, are required. 5. Conclusion Polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex were synthesized. Using magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements, the superconducting properties of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex were examined, and the Tc phase diagram obtained. To investigate the lattice anharmonicity, the Grüneisen parameter (γG) was calculated using the sample density; sound velocity; Debye temperature; and crystal structure parameters, including the volume thermal expansion coefficient and specific heat. A larger γG value was observed at x ≥ 0.4, at which Tc was higher than that at x = 0.2, and bulk superconductivity was observed. In addition, the discussion including REO0.5F0.5BiS2 (RE = Pr, Nd) showed that Tc increased with increasing γG for samples with Se-free and Se-poor compositions. The trend suggests positive correlation between anharmonicity and superconductivity in the Se-poor samples. However, the data for the Se-rich samples deviate from the γG-Tc correlation. These results imply that superconducting states and/or the influence of anharmonicity on superconductivity are different between the Sepoor and Se-rich phases of REO0.5F0.5BiCh2. To reveal the origin of the anharmonicity, we measured the specific heat and observed a peak in (C-γT)/T3 at 12.4-13.1 K for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2xSex. Those results suggest the importance of anharmonic vibration on superconductivity in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2-xSex.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"we have investigated the transport properties for the BiCh2-based system LaO1xFxBiS2-ySey (x = 0.2 and 0.5, y = 0-1.05). The ab (T) behavior and RH (T) suggest the existence of unique localization sates. The localization behavior is systematically depressed with increasing Se concentration. MR measurements indicate that WAL is realized in the heavily Se-substituted systems. The WAL behavior is weakened by the changes in F and Se concentrations. A crossover state of WAL and WL emerges around moderately F-doped and Se-free LaO0.8F0.2BiS2. The change of the MC behavior by the F and Se substitution clearly correlates with the results of ab (T) and RH (T). Moreover, the localization regions of the WAL-WL crossover and weak WAL states are possibly associated with the CDW. On the basis of the results shown here, we propose that the BiCh2-based system is a good platform to study unique localization states, including WAL, and its relation to SOC, electronic ordering, and superconductivity by using the elemental substitution with bulk single crystals. Materials and Methods The single crystals of LaO1-xFxBiS2-ySey were prepared by a high-temperature flux method by using a mixture of CsCl and KCl (CsCl: KCl = 5:3) as flux [59, 60]. We first synthesized polycrystalline samples by a conventional solid-state-reaction method [34, 35]. The obtained polycrystalline samples (0.4 g) and the flux (5.0 g) were mixed by a mortar and sealed into evacuated quartz tubes. The tubes were kept at 950 C˚ for 10 hours and slowly cooled to 600 C˚ at a rate of -2 C˚/h. The heated tubes were opened in air and the obtained products were washed and filtered by pure water to remove the flux. The actual compositions of the obtained single crystals were estimated by energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDX) with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) TM-3030 (Hitachi High-Tech). The Se concentration y was estimated by the EDX. We use the nominal x-value in this study since the O and F concentration cannot be analyzed by the EDX due to their light mass. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed by a Miniflex600 (RIGAKU). The powder XRD patterns for polycrystalline samples were refined by the Rietveld analysis by using RIETAN-FP software [61] and the profiles for single crystalline samples were analyzed by PDIndexer software [62]. The lattice constants a and c for the polycrystalline and single crystals are displayed in SI Appendix, Fig. S1. The crystal structure image was prepared by VESTA [63]. The electrical resistivity, Hall resistivity, and magnetoresistance measurements on the singlecrystalline samples were performed by a conventional four-terminal method in a physical properties measurement system (PPMS, Quantum Design) and a GM refrigerator (AXIS). We performed first-principles band-structure calculation based on the density functional theory with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof parametrization of the generalized gradient approximation [64] and the projector augmented wave (PAW) method [65] as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package [66-69]. We used the experimental crystal structures determined by our experiment [70]. To represent the O0.5F0.5 occupation in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 and LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe, one oxygen and one fluorine atom are placed in a 10-atom unit cell. For simplicity, we assumed that selenium atoms occupy inplane chalcogen sites in LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe. The core electrons in the PAW potential were [Kr]4d10 for La, [He] for O and F, [Xe]4f145d10 for Bi, [Ne] for S, and [Ar]3d10 for Se, respectively. The spin-orbit coupling was included. We took 500 eV of the cutoff energy for the wave function, a 14×14×4 k-mesh, and 0.15 eV of the Gaussian smearing width. ARPES measurements were performed at BL-9A in the Hiroshima Synchrotron Radiation Center (HiSOR) using a R4000 electron analyzer (Scienta Omicron) with p-polarized light. The total energy resolution was set to approximately 30 meV for hν = 30 eV. All samples were cleaved in-situ on the (001) plane in an ultrahigh vacuum of less than 5 × 10-9 Pa. All the measurements were performed at the same temperature of 13 K. The binding energies of the samples were determined by referencing the Fermi energy (EF) of gold electronically contacted with samples.",inline_phrase,"In conclusion,",Acknowledgment,4251,664,/content/drive/MyDrive/TFM/data/processed/corpus_v1.0_text_dumps/2211.00843v1_full.txt,2211.00843v1_full.txt,

All samples exhibited clear decreases in Tc with increasing pressure in the monoclinic phase, which indicates the absence of Tc-pinning phenomena in HEA-type REO0.5F0.5BiS2.

Because the high-pressuresynthesized sample contain high-pressure strain effects, the aging effects on superconducting properties were observed in 10-years-old samples. As a conclusion, the BiS2-based compounds are stable and their superconducting properties are also robust to aging in air. However, the highpressure strain effects exhibit aging.",section_header_strict,4.

True,"In conclusion, we have measured the resistivity, thermal expansion, specific heat, and Seebeck coefficient in a single crystal of LaO0.5F0.5Bi1-xPbxS2 (x=0∼0.15). The dependences of T* on the Pb concentration measured by various probes are similar to each other. The large anomaly of thermal expansion, shape of the specific heat anomaly, and the existence of hystereses indicate a first-order structural phase transition at T* from the tetragonal symmetry (P4/nmm). The suppression of Tc at x=0.08 near the phase boundary suggests the close relationship between the lattice structure and superconductivity.",section_header_strict,"4
