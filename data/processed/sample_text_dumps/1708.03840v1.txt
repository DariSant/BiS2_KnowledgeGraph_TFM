Abstract 
  We report the effect of Se substitution on the crystal structure and superconductivity of 
BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) layered compounds Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex (x = 01). Crystal 
structure analysis showed that both lattice constants, a and c, increased with increasing x, 
which is different from the related La-doped system, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. This 
is due to Se substitution for both in-plane and out-of-plane Ch sites in the present Ce-
doped system. Zero resistivity was observed for x = 0.21 above 2 K. Superconducting 
properties of Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex was investigated by magnetic susceptibility, and the 
highest superconducting transition temperature of 3.5 K was obtained for x = 0.6 with a 
large shielding volume fraction. The emergence of bulk superconductivity and metallic 
conductivity can be qualitatively described in terms of increased in-plane chemical 
pressure effect. A magnetic anomaly below 8 K, probably because of ferromagnetic order 
of magnetic moment of Ce3+ ions, coexists with bulk superconductivity in BiCh2 layer. 
Since the effect of Se substitution on the magnetic transition temperature is ignorable, we 
suggest that the coupling between the magnetic order at the (Eu,Ce)F layer and 
superconductivity at the Bi(S,Se)2 layer is weak.

Introduction 
There has been considerable interest in the study of BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) layered 
compounds because of their unique functionalities including superconductivity, 
thermoelectricity, and so forth [1]. The layered crystal structure of the BiCh2-based 
system consists of conducting BiCh2 layers alternating with electrically insulating 
(blocking) layers, which resembles those of cuprate or Fe-based high-transition-
temperature (Tc) superconductors [2,3]. Since the discovery of superconductivity in 
Bi4O4S3 and REO1xFxBiS2 (RE: rare-earth element), several types of BiCh2-based 
superconductors have been reported [1,4,5]. Although many experimental and theoretical 
studies have been devoted to clarify the superconductivity mechanism and to increase the 
Tc of the BiCh2-based superconductors, the consensus on the nature of superconductivity 
is yet to be achieved. Furthermore, recent measurements of laser-based angle-resolved 
photoemission spectroscopy [6] and first-principles calculations [7] have demonstrated 
that weak-coupling electron-phonon mechanism cannot describe the emerging Tc of the 
BiCh2-based superconductors. Therefore, systematic characterization is still crucial to 
clarify the superconductivity mechanism of these compounds. 
As an example, LaOBiS2 is a semiconductor with a band gap value of 1 eV, and 
superconductivity is induced by F-substitution for O2. This result suggests the 
conventional scenario that the emergence of superconductivity owing to electron carrier 
doping into the conduction band consisting of hybridized Bi 6p and Ch p orbitals [8,9]. 
Although electron carrier doping is believed to be essential to induce superconductivity 
in BiCh2-based compounds, optimally doped LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 only shows weak 
(filamentary) superconductivity rather than bulk superconductivity. To induce bulk 
superconductivity in this system, external pressure effects [1017] and/or element 
substitution at the La or S sites [1821], are available. These characteristics have been 
qualitatively described by sufficient orbital overlapping between in-plane Bi and Ch as a 
results of in-plane chemical pressure effect [22]. Indeed, it has been reported that such 
pressure effects successfully suppressed the in-plane disorder of BiCh2 conducting layer, 
which was demonstrated by means of synchrotron X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray 
absorption fine structure, and neutron diffraction [2226]. The typical example is the 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex system [27]. Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2, whose carrier concentration 
corresponds to 0.5 electron doping per Bi atoms as in the case of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, does not 
show bulk superconductivity, while the superconductivity is induced by Se substitution 
owing to the increased in-plane chemical pressure effect. 
In the present study, we report the synthesis, crystal structure analyses, and 
superconducting properties of Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. It has been reported that 


3 
 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2 showed the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetic order of RE 
moment [28]. However, bulk superconductivity has yet been achieved for the compound. 
We have demonstrated Se substitution successfully induced bulk superconductivity in 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex, which was qualitatively described by an increase of in-plane 
chemical pressure, as the case of La-doped Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. Although magnetic 
order due to the Ce3+ moment coexisted with superconductivity in BiCh2 layer, it was 
suggested that coupling between them was ignorable. 
 
Experiments 
Polycrystalline samples of Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1 
were prepared by solid-state reaction of EuS (99.9%), Ce2S3 (99.9%), BiF3 (99.9%), Bi 
(99.999%), S (99.99%), and Se (99.999%). Stoichiometric mixtures of these starting 
materials were pressed into pellets and sealed in a sealed quartz tube. The heating 
temperature was optimized for each composition: the samples were heated for 20 h at 780 
C for x = 0, at 700 C for x = 0.2 and 0.4, at 650 C for x = 0.6 and 0.8, and at 600 C 
for x = 1. The obtained product was ground, mixed, pelletized, and heated again under 
the same heating condition. 
The obtained samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) using 
a CuK radiation (Rigaku, Miniflex 600 equipped with a D/teX Ultra detector). The XRD 
patterns were analyzed using the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP code [29]. Crystal 
structure was depicted using VESTA software [30]. Magnetic susceptibility (χ) as a 
function of temperature (T) was measured using a superconducting quantum interference 
device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS-3) with an applied field of 5 
Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The T dependence of 
electrical resistivity (ρ) was measured using a four-terminal method. 
 
Results and Discussion 
Figure 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex (x = 01). Almost all of 
diffraction peaks are assigned to those of EuFBiS2-type tetragonal phase, indicating that 
the obtained samples are nearly single-phase. Several diffraction peaks due to impurity 
phase such as Bi2Se3 were also observed, as indicated by the asterisks in the Figure 1(a). 
However, both of lattice constants a and c increase with increasing x, as shown in Figure 
1(b), indicating Se ions are successfully and systematically substituted for S ions in 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. Notably, linear relationships between lattice constants and Se 
content were observed, which were different from the related La-doped systems, such as 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex, where a increases with increasing x, but c does not show apparent 


4 
 
changes with increasing x [22]. These characteristics were most likely due to site 
selectivity of Se substitution. In the case of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex, Se ions selectively 
occupy in-plane Ch1 site rather than out-of-plane Ch2 site, where schematic 
representation of crystal structure was shown in Figure 1(c). Such selective substitution 
for Ch site resulted in anisotropic elongation of lattice constants of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. 
On the other hand, as shown in Figure 2, substituted Se ions occupy both of the Ch sites 
(Ch1 and Ch2) for Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex, resulting in increases of both a and c with 
increasing x. Figures 3(a)(d) show the in-plane BiCh1 distance, inter-plane BiCh1 
bond distance, BiCh2 bond distance, and RECh2 distance. These bond distances seem 
to be correlating with the lattice constants a and c. For example, BiCh1 and RECh2 
distance tend to increase with increasing x. Besides, BiCh2 distance and inter-plane 
BiCh1 distance seem to be decreased as a result of Se-substitution. Such shrinkage is 
different from the crystal structure evolution of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex by Se substitution 
[31].  
As previously demonstrated, the in-plane chemical pressure (CP) of BiCh2-based 
layered compounds can be qualitatively described with the following equation: CP = (RBi 
+ RCh1)/(BiCh1 bond distance), where RBi is obtained from the average BiS bond 
distance for LaO0.54F0.46BiS2 [22]. The BiCh1 bond distance was calculated using the 
results of the Rietveld refinement. Figure 4 shows the in-plane CP as a function of x for 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. The CP monotonically increase with increasing x, indicating orbital 
overlap between Bi and Ch is enhanced by Se substitution. However, the value is lower 
than that of La-substituted systems Eu0.5La0.5OBiS2xSex [27]. This is because of indistinct 
site selectivity of Se substitution in Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex, as described above. 
Figure 4(a) shows T plots with an applied magnetic field of 5 Oe after ZFC for 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. Clear diamagnetic signals were not obtained for x = 0. Besides, 
diamagnetic signals corresponding to the emergence of superconductivity were observed 
for x  0.2. The largest shielding volume fraction and Tc of 3.5 K were obtained for x = 
0.6, as shown in Figure 4(b), indicating that this is a bulk superconductor. The large 
shielding fraction exceeding -1/4 should be due to demagnetization effect for the 
polycrystalline sample containing many plate crystals. For x = 0, a gradual increase of  
was observed below 8 K. It has been reported that magnetic moment of Ce3+ ions of 
CeO0.3F0.7BiS2 aligned ferromagnetically, which was demonstrated using neutron 
scattering measurements [32]. Therefore, the increase of  below 8 K in the present 
sample would be attributable to the ferromagnetic ordering of Ce3+ moment, as well. It is 
interesting to note that the amplitude of the magnetic transition was suppressed for x = 
0.2 and 0.4, and was emerged again for x  0.6, as shown in Figure S2. Although 


5 
 
superconductivity was suppressed with increasing x for x > 0.6, the magnetic transition 
was almost unchanged in this region. In addition, the magnetic transition temperature 
never changes with x, while superconducting Tc clearly depends on x. These results 
suggest that the coupling between superconductivity at the BiCh2 layer and the magnetic 
order at the Eu0.5Ce0.5F layer is notably weak. At present, we have no idea to explain the 
suppression of the amplitude of the magnetic transition for x = 0.2 and 0.4. However, the 
valence states of Eu and Ce in Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex would be essentially sensitive to its 
chemical 
composition 
and/or 
crystal 
structure, 
as 
recently 
reported 
in 
Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex [33]. In addition, X-ray absorption spectroscopy revealed that mixed 
valence of Ce ions was suppressed by F doping for CeO1xFxBiS2 [34,35]. It was 
suggested that Ce-S-Bi coupling channel is essential to drive the system from the valence 
fluctuation regime to the Kondo-like regime. Further investigation of local 
crystal/electronic structure is required to clarify the detailed relationship between 
magnetism and superconductivity in Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. 
Figure 5 shows  as a function of T. For x  0.4, T plots shows semiconducting-like 
behavior, that is,  increases with decreasing T. This semiconducting-like T dependence 
is probably due to localization of doped electrons. Metallic-like T characteristics were 
observed for x  0.6. Note that carrier concentration is believed to be almost identical in 
Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex because of isovalent substitution of S2 with Se2 ions [36]. However, 
metallic-like T plots were induced by Se substitution owing to an increase of in-plane 
CP, as in the case of Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex [27]. 
On the superconducting characteristics, the onset of the superconducting transition was 
evaluated to be Tconset = 2.3 K for x = 0, although zero resistivity was not obtained down 
to 1.9 K, as shown in Figure 5(b). Besides, zero resistivity was observed for x  0.2, which 
is consistent with a diamagnetic signal of T plots. The Tczero of 3.5 K was obtained for 
x = 0.61, as shown in Figure 5(c), and it was also consistent with Tc estimated from T 
plots. Notably,  gradually decreases well above Tczero : Tconset can be estimated to be 5.4 
K for x = 0.6. Such a gradual decrease of  is probably because of a local evolution of 
superconductivity with a higher Tc, as demonstrated in NdO1xFxBi1yS2 single crystals 
[37]. 
A superconductivity phase diagram established using T and T plots are depicted 
in Fig. 7. The semiconducting-like T behavior and filamentary weak superconducting 
transition with Tconset of 2.3 K was observed x = 0. The semiconducting-like behavior was 
suppressed by Se substitution, and bulk superconductivity with a large shielding volume 
fraction was observed. The highest Tc was 3.5 K for x = 0.6. Evidently, the 
superconducting properties of Eu0.5La0.5OBiS2xSex was optimized for x = 0.6, at the 


6 
 
boundary of semiconducting-metallic phase transition. Such emergence of metallic-like 
T behavior and bulk superconductivity was quite similar to the case of related 
compounds, such as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex [27]. Thus, the importance of the in-plane CP 
for the emergence of metallic conductivity and bulk superconductivity in BiCh2-based 
compounds are clearly shown with the new BiCh2-based superconductor system. 
 
Conclusions 
We have synthesized a new BiCh2-based superconductor system, Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex. 
Polycrystalline samples for x = 01 were prepared by a solid-state reaction. Both lattice 
constants, a and c, monotonically increases with increasing x. This linear relationship 
between lattice constants and Se content is different from that of related compounds, such 
as Eu0.5La0.5FBiS2xSex. Crystal structure analysis by the Rietveld refinement showed that 
this is due to the indistinct site selectivity of Se substitution; namely, Se occupied both of 
in-plane Ch1 and out-of-plane Ch2 sites. The sample with x = 0 exhibited the 
semiconducting-like T and weak superconducting signals. Metallic-like conductivity 
and bulk superconductivity were induced by Se substitution. Such characteristics were 
qualitatively described in terms of increased in-plane CP, as in the case of related 
compounds. The highest Tc was 3.5 K for x = 0.6, and superconductivity phase diagram 
was established. Magnetic transition, probably due to ferromagnetic order of magnetic 
moment of Ce3+, coexists with bulk superconductivity in BiCh2 layer. The coupling 
between superconductivity and magnetic order is ignorable in Eu0.5Ce0.5FBiS2xSex.
