We have performed an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of the BiS2-based superconductor
Nd(O,F)BiS2. Two small electron-like Fermi surfaces around X (π, 0) are observed, which enclose 2.4% and
1.1% of the Brillouin zone area, respectively, corresponding to an electron doping of 7% per Bi site. The low-
energy spectrum consists of a weakly-dispersing broad hump and a dispersive branch, which follows well the
calculated band dispersion. This hump is drastically suppressed with increasing temperature, while the dis-
persive branch is essentially unaﬀected. The anomalous thermal eﬀect indicates a highly interacting electronic
state, in which the superconducting pairing develops.

The recent discovery of superconductivity with Tc up to ∼
10 K in the BiS2-based compounds has attracted a lot of at-
tentions [1–10]. As in the cuprate and iron-based high-Tc su-
perconductors, the BiS2 family has a layered crystal structure
consisting of superconducting BiS2 layers intercalated with
various block layers. Band structure calculations show that
the parent compound of the BiS2-based superconductors is a
band insulator with an energy gap of ∼0.8 eV [11–14], and
bulk superconductivity induced by electron doping is derived
from the Bi 6px/py orbitals, in which correlation eﬀects are ex-
pected to be weaker than those in the 3d orbitals of the cuprate
and iron-based superconductors. The superconducting transi-
tion temperature Tc reaches a maximum at a nominal doping
level δ ∼0.5 for many compounds [1–10], where strong nest-
ing between the large parallel Fermi surface (FS) segments is
suggested in band calculations [11–14]. Therefore, most of
the theoretical models for the pairing mechanism are based on
the nesting scenario.
However, there is a large bifurcation regarding the conse-
quences of the nesting. On the one hand, the nesting is pro-
posed to enhance the electron-phonon coupling, thus favor-
ing a conventional BCS superconductivity [11–14]. On the
other hand, as widely believed for the iron-based supercon-
ductors, the strong FS nesting could enhance charge or spin
ﬂuctuations, and thus electronic correlations may play a ma-
jor role in the superconducting pairing [15–18].
Magnetic
penetration depth and muon-spin rotation spectroscopy mea-
surements support a conventional s-wave superconductivity in
the strong electron-phonon coupling limit [19, 20], whereas
the absence of phonon anomaly in neutron scattering mea-
surements suggests that the electron-phonon coupling may be
much weaker than theoretically expected [21]. Recent scan-
ning tunneling spectroscopy measurements show that the ratio
2∆/kBTc is much larger than the BCS value [22, 23]. Giant su-
perconducting ﬂuctuations and an anomalous semiconducting
normal state are also observed, suggesting that the supercon-
ductivity might be diﬀerent from that of a conventional BCS
superconductor [23].
In this Letter, we present angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) results of the BiS2-based supercon-
ductor Nd(O,F)BiS2 (Tczero = 4 K). Two small electron-like
FSs around X (π, 0) are observed, corresponding to an elec-
tron doping of 7% of itinerant carriers per Bi site. As a re-
sult, the measured electronic structure is far from the pro-
posed FS nesting. Furthermore, we reveal that the low-energy
spectrum consists of a broad hump around -0.3 eV, which is
drastically suppressed with increasing temperature, and a dis-
persive branch, which is essentially unaﬀected by the temper-
ature. This exotic spectral behavior suggests that the low-
temperature normal state of this superconductor is a highly
interacting electronic state.
Single
crystals
with
a
nominal
composition
of
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 were grown by a ﬂux method with KCl/LiCl
as the ﬂux. Energy dispersion spectrum (EDS) measurements
were performed on several pieces of samples, which give an
averaged composition of Nd0.95±0.02OyF0.44±0.1Bi0.94±0.02S2.
ARPES measurements were performed at the Institute of
Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, using the He Iα
(hν = 21.218 eV) resonance lines. The angular and energy
resolutions were set to 0.2◦and 14 ∼32 meV, respectively.
Samples with a typical size of ∼1 × 1 mm2 were cleaved in
situ at 30 K and measured between 30 and 230 K in a working
vacuum better than 4 × 10−11 Torr. The Fermi level (EF) of
the samples was referenced to that of a gold ﬁlm evaporated
onto the sample holder.
Figure 1 shows the band dispersions along the high-
symmetry lines Γ-M-X-Γ in an energy range within 4 eV be-
low EF. We observe several dispersive bands below -1.2 eV
and an electron-like band dispersion with a bottom of -0.3 eV
near X. There is an energy gap of ∼0.9 eV between them.
To understand the multiband electronic structure, we super-
impose the local-density approximation (LDA) band structure
on top of our data. The calculated band structure reﬂects some
main features in the experiment data, especially for the direct
gap between the conduction and valence bands. In LDA calcu-
lations, the undoped parent compound is a band insulator and

its EF is located within the energy gap. The experimentally
obtained EF is situated in the conduction bands, indicating
that electron carriers are introduced in the superconducting
samples due to the substitution of O with F.
Figure 2 shows the FS mapping data in the kx-ky plane. We
extract two FS pockets centered at X, which come from the
near-EF electron-like dispersion shown in Fig. 1. The two
extracted FSs exhibit a signiﬁcantly anisotropic separation,
which is a result of the cooperative eﬀects from spin-orbit cou-
pling (SOC) and interlayer coupling, as explained below. We
have performed LDA calculations using the following mod-
els. In a one-BiS2-layer model (same as the surface layer af-
ter cleave) with SOC [Fig. 2(d)], the near-EF bands are split
along both XM and ΓX with comparable magnitudes. In a
two-BiS2-layer model (same as the bulk) without SOC [Fig.
2(e)], the bands are doubly-degenerate along XM, but split
along ΓX due to the interlayer coupling. In the presence of
SOC, the Rashba term lifts the degeneracy along XM but the
splitting magnitude along XM is much smaller than along ΓX
[Fig. 2(f)], in agreement with our observations.
The two FS pockets enclose 1.1% and 2.4% of the Bril-
louin zone area, respectively. Counting the Luttinger volume
of two-dimensional FS sheets, the two observed FSs corre-
spond to an electron doping of 7% per Bi site. The value for
doped itinerant carrier density is much less than those inferred
from the nominal composition and the EDS data. The discrep-
ancy can be explained in several ways. Firstly, the possibility
of charge polarization at the terminal layer cannot be com-
pletely excluded, though this scenario is unlikely since the
cleavage occurs between two symmetrical BiS2 layers. More-
over, the plasma frequency calculated using the experimental
doping level is ∼2.1 eV, in agreement with the optical data
[24], suggesting that the ARPES data reﬂect the intrinsic car-
rier density in the bulk. Secondly, as both oxygen and ﬂuorine

are light elements, their concentrations given from the EDS
data may not be reliable [23]. Thirdly, part of the carriers may
be localized and thus do not contribute to the conduction band.
In this case, the localized carriers could form ﬂat bands within
the energy gap.
We ﬁnd that at low temperature, the low-energy spectrum
near EF consists of a large hump around -0.3 eV and a disper-
sive branch, which tracks well the calculated conduction band
dispersion. Figure 3 shows ARPES data of the conduction
bands taken along XM at 30 K. Two electron-like bands are
resolved in Figs. 3(b) and 3(d). As mentioned above, the band
splitting along XM originates from the SOC. The band disper-
sion, extracted by tracking the peak positions of the momen-
tum distribution curves (MDCs), follows well the LDA bands
calculated with SOC. On the other hand, the energy distribu-
tion curves (EDCs) are characterized by a broad hump, whose
maximum does not cross EF but tends to bend back beyond
kF2 [Fig. 3(c)]. As shown in Fig. 3(e), the EDC at kF2 shows
a sharp Fermi cutoﬀ, indicating a metallic behavior. There
is a change of the slope on the lower binding energy side of
the hump at ∼-0.05 eV. The linear extrapolation suggests that
the hump contributes vanishingly small spectral weight at EF,
indicating that the ﬁnite low-energy spectral weight at EF is
dominated by the dispersive branch.

dependence characterized by a rapid suppression of the spec-
tral weight of the broad hump with increasing temperature
that, nevertheless, leaves the dispersive branch little changed.
The temperature dependent ARPES results along cut 2 are
shown in Fig. 4. A sharp contrast between the intensity con-
tours at 30 K [Fig. 4(a)] and 230 K [Fig. 4(b)] is clearly
visible. To further clarify the evolution of the spectrum with
temperature, we plot the MDCs at EF and the EDCs at kF of
the left branch at various temperatures between 30 and 230
K in Figs. 4(d) and 4(e), respectively. All the spectra are
normalized by the photon ﬂux. To remove the thermal broad-
ening eﬀect due to the Fermi-Dirac statistics, the EDCs in Fig.
4(e) are divided by the resolution-convoluted Fermi functions
at corresponding temperatures and then multiplied by that of
10 K. The MDCs almost collapse onto a single curve, whereas
the lineshape of the EDCs changes dramatically with temper-
ature. The spectral weight of the broad hump is suppressed
rapidly with increasing temperature. The hump can no longer
be clearly resolved above 150 K and the spectra at 180 K and

230 K nearly coincide. In sharp contrast to the loss of spectral
weight below EF, the Fermi cutoﬀof all the EDCs (raw data)
taken at various temperatures crosses exactly at EF [inset of
Fig. 4(e)], which is consistent with the collapse of the MDCs
shown in Fig. 4(d), indicating a negligible temperature eﬀect
on the spectral weight at EF that is dominated by the disper-
sive branch. As shown in Fig. 4(c), with the suppression of the
broad hump, the dichotomy between the dispersions of EDC
and MDC peaks is almost eliminated at 230 K. The disper-
sions at 230 K are in good consistence with the one extracted
from the MDCs at 30 K that corresponds to the dispersive
branch. Therefore, in sharp contrast to the strong tempera-
ture dependence of the broad hump, the dispersive branch is
essentially unaﬀected with temperature.
A conventional explanation for temperature-induced loss of
spectral weight is through the eﬀect of lattice vibrations. Such
an eﬀect in photoemission spectra is similar to that found in
X-ray and neutron scattering, where the intensities of diﬀrac-
tion peaks are multiplied by the Debye-Waller factor e−2W (W
∝T) [25]. Indeed, the integrated spectral weight as a function
of temperature can be approximately ﬁtted to a function of A
+ Be−CT, as shown in Fig. 4(f). However, the extracted De-
bye temperature from the ﬁtting is about only 3 K [26], two
orders of magnitudes smaller than the estimated values from
the speciﬁc heat data [6, 7, 27–29]. Therefore, the eﬀect of


4
conventional lattice vibrations cannot explain the giant tem-
perature eﬀects in our data.
Loss of spectral weight over a large energy scale has been
observed in a polaronic state of the colossal magnetoresis-
tant manganites La2−2xSr1+2xMn2O7 [30–33]. In the polaronic
state induced by strong electron-phonon coupling, the spec-
tral function consists of a low-energy “zero-phonon” quasi-
particle peak and a hump-like high-energy incoherent reso-
nance. Our observation of a high-energy hump as well as a
sharp Fermi cutoﬀbears some resemblance to the signature
of polarons. In the manganites, the incoherent branch loses
its partial spectral weight over an energy range of up to 0.8
eV, which is accompanied by a disappearance of the quasi-
particle peaks around the metal-insulator transition tempera-
ture. This could be associated with either the loss of polaron
coherence [32] or a decreased fraction of metallic regions in
the scenario of phase separation [31]. Assuming that the po-
laron picture could be applied to the BiS2 system, the spectral
weight of the incoherent branch, i.e. the broad hump, is dras-
tically suppressed with increasing temperature, while the low-
energy coherent branch, which dominates the spectral weight
at EF, is not aﬀected. The behavior looks very unusual in the
framework of polarons because the strong suppression of the
incoherent branch indicates signiﬁcant changes of the pola-
ronic states, which seems not to be perceived by the coher-
ent part. Our spectra exhibit distinctly diﬀerent temperature
dependence from those in the manganites, indicating that the
giant thermal eﬀects observed in the two systems might have
diﬀerent origins.
The

of

in

also
shows
nontrivial
temperature
depen-
dence of the spectral function [34, 35]. The NaxWO3 and
BiS2 systems bear an interesting resemblance in their elec-
tronic structures. Their undoped parent compounds are band
insulators with energy gaps of an order of eV between the
valence and conduction bands. The introduction of electron
carriers by element substitutions or intercalations leads to
an insulator-metal transition on small electron-like FSs. The
conduction electrons in Na0.025WO3 are self-trapped due to
strong disorder induced by the randomly distributed Na+
ions, forming a weakly dispersive polaron band near the
top of valence bands. The breakdown of polarons at high
temperature leads to a large decrease in the intensity of the
polaron band, while the spectrum of the conduction band is
not signiﬁcantly changed. These properties are quite similar
to what we have observed in BiS2 except that the polaron
band would be localized near the bottom of the conduction
bands in our case. We note that the polaronic self-trapping of
carriers could also explain the small FS pockets observed in
our experiment. It is expected that as the polarons become
more delocalized, the spectral weight should be transferred
to other k-points. However, such a spectral weight transfer is
not observed at least along the measured momentum cut.
In summary, our ARPES results show two small electron-
like FSs around X (π, 0) instead of large hole-like FSs cen-
tered at Γ (0, 0) and M (π, π) proposed in recent theoreti-
cal models. The anomalous temperature dependence of the
low-energy spectrum indicates that the superconducting pair-
ing develops in a highly interacting electronic state.
Our
results provide detailed information on the low-energy elec-
tronic structures and valuable insights for further experimental
and theoretical studies of the pairing mechanism in the BiS2-
based superconductors.
