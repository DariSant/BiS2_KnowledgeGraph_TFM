Abstract 
We have systematically investigated the crystal structure, magnetic 
susceptibility, 
and 
electrical 
resistivity 
of 
the 
BiS2-based 
superconductor 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 (x = 0 – 0.7). With expanding lattice volume by Se substitution, 
bulk superconductivity was induced for x ≥ 0.2, and the highest Tc of 3.8 K was 
observed in x = 0.5 (LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe). Metallic conductivity was observed for x ≥ 0.3 in 
the resistivity measurement, whereas semiconducting-like behavior was observed for x 
≤ 0.2. The induction of bulk superconductivity by the partial substitution of S by Se in 
the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor should be positively linked to the enhancement of 
metallic conductivity.

1. Introduction 
Since the discovery of the novel layered BiS2-based superconductor Bi4O4S3 
[1], many studies exploring new superconductors and clarifying the mechanisms of 
superconductivity in the BiS2 family have been carried out. Thus far, three types of 
BiS2-based superconductor, Bi4O4S3, REOBiS2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Yb) [2-9], 
and AEFBiS2 (AE = Sr, and Eu) [10-14] have been discovered, and the highest transition 
temperature (Tc) reaches about 11 K in LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 [15]. BiS2-based superconductors 
have a layered structure consisting of the alternate stacking of the BiS2 superconducting 
layer and the blocking layer. The superconducting properties of the BiS2 family can be 
tuned by substituting the elements at the blocking layers. These characteristics resemble 
those of cuprate and Fe-based superconductors [16,17]. In BiS2-based layered materials, 
electron doping into the BiS2 layers is essential for the induction of superconductivity 
[18]. For example, in the LaOBiS2 system, superconductivity is induced by a partial 
substitution of O2- by F- or by a partial substitution of La3+ by M4+ at the blocking layers 
[2,19]. Namely, element substitution at the blocking layer is effective for inducing 
superconductivity 
and 
tuning 
its 
superconducting 
properties 
in 
BiS2-based 
superconductors. 
Furthermore, 
several 
high-pressure 
studies 
revealed 
that 
superconducting properties are sensitive to changes in local crystal structures: the Tc can 
be enhanced by optimal lattice contraction [20-27]. In addition, it was reported that the 
chemical pressure effect could enhance superconducting properties in the RE(O,F)BiS2 
system [8,28-31]. In Ce1-xNdx(O,F)BiS2 and Nd1-xSmx(O,F)BiS2, bulk superconductivity 
was induced by the decrease in lattice volume, and the highest Tc of 5.6 K was observed 
in Nd0.2Sm0.8O0.7F0.3BiS2 [29]. In La1-xSmxO0.5F0.5BiS2, bulk superconductivity was 
induced by the chemical pressure effect, and the highest Tc of 5.4 K was obtained for 


3 
 
La0.2Sm0.8O0.5F0.5BiS2 [31]. These experimental results suggest that the intrinsic (bulk 
and higher Tc) superconductivity could be induced by optimizing crystal structures in 
the BiS2-based family. In fact, the importance of the optimization of the local structure 
in determining superconducting or physical properties was suggested in theoretical 
studies [32,33] and X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies [34,35]. 
There are many reports on the element substitution effects of blocking layers in 
REO1-xFxBiS2. On the other hand, there are only a few reports on the effect of element 
substitution within the superconducting layer. In Bi4O4S3, a partial substitution of S by 
Se decreased Tc [36]. The Tc of Nd(O,F)BiS2 decreased with a partial substitution of S 
by Se as well [37]. In contrast, the observation of bulk superconductivity with a Tc of 
3.8 K in LaO1-xFxBiSSe, in which 50% of the S sites are replaced by Se, has recently 
been reported [38]. In this study, the effect of Se substitution at the superconducting 
layers on the superconducting properties of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 were systematically 
investigated as a function of Se concentration. We synthesized polycrystalline samples 
of Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2, investigated their physical properties, and 
established a superconductivity phase diagram. 
 
 
2. Experimental Procedure 
The polycrystalline samples of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 (x = 0 - 0.7) were 
prepared by a solid-state reaction method. First, powders of Bi2Se3 were presynthesized 
from Bi (99.999%) and Se (99.99%) grains. The weighed Bi and Se grains were sealed 
in an evacuated quartz tube and heated at 800 °C for 10 h. The starting materials for 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 were La2O3 powder (99.9%), LaF3 powder (99.9%), La2S3 


4 
 
powder (99.9%), Bi2Se3 powder, Bi grains, and S grains (99.9%). The mixtures with 
nominal compositions of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 were mixed well, ground, pelletized, 
sealed in an evacuated quartz tube and annealed at 700 °C for 15 h. The calcined 
samples were ground, pelletized, and heated in an evacuated quartz tube by the same 
process as the first heating. The obtained samples were characterized by powder X-ray 
diffraction (XRD) analysis using the - 2 method with CuKradiation. The lattice 
constants were estimated by the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP [39]. The 
temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility was measured using a 
superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer with an applied field 
of 5 Oe after both zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC). The temperature 
dependence of resistivity was measured by the four-probe method. 
 
 
3. Results and Discussion 
Figure 1 shows the powder XRD patterns of LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 (x = 0 - 0.7). 
For all the samples, the obtained XRD peaks of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 could be indexed using 
the P4/nmm space group as indicated by Miller indices displayed with the XRD pattern 
of x = 0. The Rietveld refinement result for the XRD pattern of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe (x = 
0.5) is shown in Fig. 2. Except for the tiny peak of bismuth oxide at approximately 2 = 
27.5º, almost all the observed profiles were refined, indicating that the S/Se solution 
system is single phase (Rwp ~ 0.16). Since LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 is a solid-solution 
system, we carried out refinements by inputting a virtual element of S/Se: the mixing 
ratio was fixed to the starting nominal compositions. Then, the Rietveld refinement was 
carried out using typical crystal structure data of the REOBiS2-type materials. Having 


5 
 
considered the resolution of our laboratory-level XRD analysis with powder samples 
containing the S/Se solution, we simply discuss the variations in the lattice constants of 
a-axis, c-axis, and volume for the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 system in the crystal structure 
part of this article. 
Figure 3 shows the Se concentration dependences of the lattice constants 
throughout (a) a-axis, (b) c-axis and (c) volume. The lattice constants of a-axis and 
c-axis increase with increasing Se concentration. These changes are consistent with the 
difference in ionic radius between S2- (184 pm) and Se2- (198 pm). The a-axis 
monotonically increases with increasing Se concentration. The c-axis slightly increases 
up to x = 0.4 and largely increases above x = 0.5. These tendencies indicate that the Se 
ions are selectively introduced into one site of the BiS2 superconducting layer, although 
we cannot obtain further information within the present analysis. 
Figure 4(a) shows the temperature dependences of the ZFC magnetic 
susceptibility (4) with an applied magnetic field of 5 Oe for LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. 
For x = 0 and 0.1, small diamagnetic signals were observed, indicating that the shielding 
volume fractions were clearly as low as superconducting states of a bulk superconductor. 
We regard these two samples as filamentary superconductors. Tc was defined as the 
irreversible temperature (Tc
irr) that is the bifurcation point between the ZFC and FC 
susceptibility curves, as shown in Fig. 4(b). Tc for x = 0 is 2.5 K. Tc decreases to 2.2 K 
at x = 0.1. Above x = 0.2, Tc increases, and the shielding volume fraction is clearly 
enhanced. On the basis of the large shielding fraction, we regard the samples with x = 
0.2 - 0.7 as bulk superconductors. In fact, a partial substitution of S by Se induces bulk 
superconductivity in the LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 system. The highest Tc of 3.8 K is 
observed for x = 0.5. For x > 0.5, Tc decreases with increasing Se concentration.

Figure 5(a) shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistivity for 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 in the temperature range between 1.8 and 300 K. Figure 5(b) is 
the enlargement  magnified view of Fig. 5(a) at low temperatures near Tc. For 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, semiconducting-like (bad-metal-like) behavior is observed above its Tc, 
and zero resistivity is observed at 2.5 K. Resistivity clearly decreases with increasing Se 
concentration, and the semiconducting-like behavior disappears for x ≥ 0.3. For x = 0.3, 
resistivity is almost constant as a function of temperature below 300 K. For x ≥ 0.4, the 
temperature dependence of resistivity shows metallic behavior. In fact, the values of 
resistivity at room temperature for x = 0.4 - 0.7 are 5 times as low as that for x = 0. The 
estimated zero-resistivity temperatures (Tc
zero) for all the samples correspond to the Tc
irr 
estimated by the magnetic susceptibility measurements. These results indicate that the 
evolution of bulk superconductivity should be related to the enhancement of metallic 
conductivity in the Se-substituted LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 system. 
Figure 
6 
shows 
the 
superconductivity 
phase 
diagram 
of 
the 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 system where Tc (Tc
irr) is plotted as a function of Se concentration 
(x). With increasing Se concentration, Tc firstly decreases to 2.2 K at x = 0.1. Tc 
increases with increasing Se concentration within 0.2 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 and reaches the highest 
Tc of 3.8 K at x = 0.5. In the Se-poor region, the samples show filamentary 
superconductivity, and bad-metal-like conductivity is observed. With increasing Se 
concentration, metallic conductivity is induced, and superconducting properties are 
enhanced. The appearance of bulk superconductivity should be linked to the 
enhancement of metallic characteristics. 
Although we have revealed the superconductivity phase diagram of the 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2 system as a function of Se concentration, we should mention that 


7 
 
the highest Tc in this system is clearly lower than 11 K for the high-pressure phase of 
LaO0.5F0.5BiS2. For the high-pressure phase of LaO0.5F0.5BiS2, Tomita et al. suggested 
that the crystal structure is not tetragonal but monoclinic [23]. Namely, the higher-Tc 
phase would appear in a distorted structure. In this study, we have revealed that the 
tetragonal structure does not change with Se substitution up to x = 0.7. On the basis of 
these facts, we assume that the partial substitution of S by Se could enhance 
superconductivity, but it could not induce the higher-Tc phase as those revealed in 
previous high-pressure studies of BiS2-based superconductors [21,22,26,27]. 
 
4. Summary 
We have systematically investigated the crystal structure, magnetic 
susceptibility, 
and 
electrical 
resistivity 
of 
polycrystalline 
samples 
of 
LaO0.5F0.5Bi(S1-xSex)2. With increasing Se concentration, the lattice constants a-axis and 
c-axis systematically increased. With expanding lattice volume by Se substitution, bulk 
superconductivity was induced for x ≥ 0.3, and the highest Tc of 3.8 K was observed for 
x = 0.5. One of the notable facts is that the metallic conductivity was observed for x ≥ 
0.3 in the resistivity measurement, whereas bad-metal-like (semiconducting-like) 
behavior was observed for x ≤ 0.2. The induction of bulk superconductivity by the 
partial substitution of S by Se in the LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 superconductor should be positively 
linked to the enhancement of metallic conductivity.
