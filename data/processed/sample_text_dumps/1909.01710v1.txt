Superconductivity is achieved in Nd1−xCexOBiS2 via electron doping using mixed-valence Ce ions. Single crystals
with x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 are generated using a CsCl ﬂux method. Plate-like single crystals with dimensions of
0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3 were obtained. The magnetic susceptibility χ(T) indicates large diamagnetism, and the electrical
resistivity ρ(T) indicates zero resistivity. The maximum value of Tc is observed at 4.7 K in Nd0.8Ce0.2OBiS2 from χ(T).
From the ρ(T) measurements taken in several magnetic ﬁelds, the upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2(0) is estimated to be ∼12
and ∼0.34 T for the ab- and c-planes, respectively. We redetermined µ0Hc2(0) of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2, as ∼35 and ∼0.78 T
for the ab- and c-planes, respectively. The anisotropic parameter Γ is estimated to be ∼35 for Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 and ∼45
for NdO0.7F0.3BiS2. The µ0Hc2(0) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 is approximately two times smaller than that of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2,
although the diﬀerence of Γ is approximately 10.
The
newly
discovered
BiS2-based
superconductors
Bi4O4S3 and RO1−xFxBiS2 (R = La, Ce, Pr, Nd) are of inter-
est owing to their various crystal structures similar to those
in layered cuprate and iron pnictide superconductors.1–9) The
crystal structure of the BiCh2-based (Ch: chalcogen) super-
conductors consists of alternating stacks of RO-blocking and
BiCh2 conducting layers. It is known that electron carrier
doping into the conduction band, mainly comprising Bi-6p
and Ch-p orbitals,10,11) induces superconductivity in the
BiS2-based compounds. Recent research has indicated that
in-plane chemical pressure is related to the overlapping of the
Bi-6p and Ch-p orbitals, which is a signiﬁcant contributor to
bulk superconductivity.12) A typical approach to increasing
overlapping is by substituting elements with a longer ionic
radius (e.g. Se substitution for S sites).13–15) From detailed
analysis of the crystal structure, the chemical pressure eﬀects
eﬀectively ameliorated the in-plane disorder in the BiCh2
conducting layer.16–19)
The mechanism of superconductivity in BiS2-based com-
pounds has received attention but remains under debate.
The speciﬁc heat measurements of a bulk superconductor
of LaO0.5F0.5BiSSe suggest full gap symmetry and indi-
cate that superconductivity is mediated by electron–phonon
coupling.20,21) However, the Se isotope eﬀect suggests that
the superconducting pairing interaction may not be due
to electron–phonon interaction.22) In a single crystal of
Nd(O,F)BiS2, penetration depth and thermal conductivity in-
dicate that superconductivity is a full-gap symmetry.23–25) In
contrast, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
(ARPES) measurements suggest that the superconducting gap
of NdO0.71F0.29BiS2 is anisotropic.26) Thus, the mechanism of
the BiS2-based superconductor is still controversial.
As previously mentioned, electron doping is necessary
to induce bulk superconductivity in BiS2-based compounds.
Recently, superconductivity has been observed in non-
substituted CeOBiS2; this is mostly because of electron dop-
ing by mixed-valence Ce ions.27) The compound is consid-

ered to have the mixed valence of Ce3+/Ce4+. In addition,
superconductivity in the non-F-substituted LaOBiSSe and
PrOBiS2 is achieved by Ce-substitution at R-sites, suggest-
ing that the carriers are injected owing to the mixed valence
of Ce3+/Ce4+.28,29) These results indicate that substitution by
mixed-valence Ce ions can eﬀectively induce superconductiv-
ity.
The investigation of superconductivity induced by electron
doping except for F helps in a better understanding of the
mechanism. Because F-substituted NdOBiS2 is known to ex-
hibit the highest superconducting transition temperature (Tc)
in the ROBiS2 compounds at ambient pressure,5,30) a higher
Tc is highly desirable in NdOBiS2 by Ce-substitution. In the
present study, we have successfully generated single crys-
tals of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 and reported the discovery of super-
conductivity in Nd1−xCexOBiS2 through electrical resistivity

ρ(T) and magnetic susceptibility χ(T) measurements. From
the results, we revealed the superconducting properties of
Nd1−xCexOBiS2. We noted that Tc of the crystals grown using
the 99.9%- and 99.999%-CsCl ﬂuxes were similar.31) In other
words, we conﬁrmed that the F impurity in 99.9%-CsCl ﬂux
is not the primary factor in electron doping to induce super-
conductivity.
Single crystals of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 with x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
and 0.5 were synthesized by a CsCl-ﬂux method. The nomi-
nal compositions of Nd2O3 (99.9%, Kojundo Chemical Lab.
Co.), Nd2S3 (99%, Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co.), CeO2 (99%,
Kojundo Chemical Lab. Co.), and Bi2S3 (99.9%, Kojundo
Chemical Lab. Co.) were weighed (total mass of 0.8 g) and
mixed with 5 g of CsCl powder (99.999%, Kojundo Chemi-
cal Lab. Co.). The mixture was sealed in an evacuated quartz
tube. The quartz tube underwent heating at 950 for 10 h fol-
lowed by cooling to 650 at a rate of 1 /h; then, the sample
was cooled to room temperature in the furnace. We success-
fully synthesized single crystals of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 with x =
0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the plate-like
crystals were grown with x = 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5, and the typical
dimensions are approximately 0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3. The shape
of the generated crystal with x = 0.2 is slightly lumpy and
small. A single crystal with x = 0.1 was not generated at this
stage. The results indicate that single crystals with low car-
rier doping are diﬃcult to generate, and non-doped NdOBiS2
could not be successfully synthesized.5,30)
The crystal structure was veriﬁed through X-ray diﬀrac-
tion (XRD), which employed a conventional X-ray spec-
trometer equipped with Cu-Kα radiation (RINT 2500,
Rigaku). The chemical composition of the single crystals of
Nd1−xCexOBiS2 was analyzed by X-ray ﬂuorescence (XRF),
conducted using a JEOL JSX 1000S ElementEye. Electri-
cal resistivity ρ(T) was measured via a standard dc-four-
probe method. Electrical connections with the sample com-
prised gold wires (φ = 25 µm) joined with Ag paste (4922N,
DuPont). DC-magnetic susceptibility χ(T) was measured by
a magnetic property measurement system (MPMS, Quan-
tum Design), down to 2.0 K. AC-electrical resistivity ρ(T)
was measured by a physical property measurement system
(PPMS, Quantum Design), down to 2.0 K in magnetic ﬁelds
of several intensities, including zero. Thermoelectric power S
was measured using a seesaw heating method by considering
a diﬀerent temperature ∆T of about 1 K. Thermoelectric volt-
age ∆V was measured by a nano-voltmeter (2182A, Keithley).
Figure 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of the single crys-
talline sample of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 along the c-axis at room
temperature. The presence of only 00l diﬀraction peaks indi-
cates that the ab-plane is well grown. Figure 1(c) shows that
the lattice constant c was 1.3661 nm for Nd0.8Ce0.2OBiS2, and
decreased as Ce content x increased. The result conﬂicts with
lanthanide contraction for a trivalent Ce valence, because the
ionic radius of Nd3+ is smaller than that of Ce3+. However, the
lattice constants of CeOBiS2 are slightly smaller than those
of LaOBiS2 and PrOBiS2, indicating that the Ce valence is a
mixed state of Ce3+/Ce4+.27) Thus, the shrinking of the lattice
constants of the Ce-substituted NdOBiS2 indicates the pres-
ence of Ce4+.
The XRF analysis helped determine the chemical com-
position ratios of the single crystals for x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
and 0.5, which were Nd0.73Ce0.24BiS1.7, Nd0.72Ce0.30BiS1.9,
Nd0.59Ce0.41BiS2.0, and Nd0.57Ce0.53BiS2.1, respectively. The
O composition ratio could not be determined. The values sug-
gest that the chemical composition of the grown crystals is
almost consistent with the nominal one, although the ratio of
x = 0.5 is slightly deviated. The ratio of the single crystal for
x = 0.2 seems to indicate a lack of S. One possible explana-
tion is that the deviation is ascribed to the lumpy shape, which
causes a measurement error. Another possibility is that a lack
of S leads to the lumpy shape.
Figures 2(a-b) show the T-dependence of the magnetic sus-
ceptibility χ(T) of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 on heating after zero-ﬁeld
cooling (ZFC) and then on cooling in the ﬁeld (ﬁeld cool-
ing, FC) for H || ab and H || c. A large diamagnetism was
observed in Nd1−xCexOBiS2 (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). The
signiﬁcant exceedance of −4πχ is due to the diamagnetic fac-
tor when H was applied along the c-axis. By applying a mag-
netic ﬁeld along the ab-plane, the diamagnetic factor is almost
negligible. Figure 2(b) shows that a large diamagnetism was
observed in Nd0.8Ce0.2OBiS2 at 4.7 K, suggesting that the su-
perconductivity is of bulk nature, although the shielding eﬀect
slightly exceeds −1 in 4πχ. It is likely that the roughness of
the crystal shape leads to the misalignment of the ﬁeld applied
to the ab-plane.
Figures 2(c-d) show that Tc is deﬁned as the temperature
where the magnetization drop starts to appear. Because χ(T)
for x = 0.5 gradually decreases, we consider Tc as the tem-
perature where FC starts to deviate from the ZFC. The values

obtained for Tc are 4.75 (x = 0.2), 4.55 (x = 0.3), 4.42 (x =
0.4), and 3.85 K (x = 0.5). Tc slightly decreases with increas-
ing x. This behavior corresponds to the F-doped NdOBiS2,5)
which exhibits the highest Tc (= 5.2 K) at ambient pressure.
In addition, the maximum Tc of the Ce-doped compounds is
slightly lower than that of NdO1−xFxBiS2.5) Such behavior is
also observed in Ce-doped LaOBiSSe and PrOBiS2.28,29) The
origin of the diﬀerence in Tc is not clear.
Figures 2(e-f) show the T-dependence of the electrical re-
sistivity ρ(T) of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 at low temperatures. Super-
conductivity was conﬁrmed by ρ(T) in all the samples. Tc
obtained from ρ(T) was determined as the temperature of
50%ρ0, where ρ0 is the residual resistivity. The error bar as
the superconducting transition width of T onset
c
and T zero
c
is de-
ﬁned as 98%ρ0 and 2%ρ0. The values obtained for Tc are 4.18
(x = 0.2), 4.92 (x = 0.3), 4.47 (x = 0.4), and 4.11 K (x = 0.5).
Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 exhibits the highest Tc among the Ce-doped
compounds, where T zero
c
is almost consistent with Tc obtained
from χ(T). Tc for x = 0.2 obtained from ρ(T) diﬀers from that
of χ(T). This could be owing to the Joule heat caused when
current was applied in an extremely small sample. A super-
conducting phase diagram summarizes the above in Fig. 3(a).
Figure 2(f) shows the T-dependence of the electrical re-
sistivity ρ(T) of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 down to 3.0 K. A large
hump was observed in ρ(T) of non-doped CeOBiS2 at ap-
proximately 130 K. The result corresponds to the previous
report.27) Metallic behavior was observed when x = 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, and 0.5, indicating that the electron carriers were doped
with the mixed-valence state of the Ce ion. At x = 0.5, a small
hump was observed at approximately 80 K and was greatly
suppressed from the non-doped compound. Figure 3(b) shows
the values of ρ(6 K) and ρ(280 K) plotted. Both ρ(6 K) and
ρ(280 K) increase with the Ce content x.
To understand the carrier density of the Ce-doped
NdOBiS2, we measured the Seebeck coeﬃcient S at 280 K,
as shown in Fig. 3(c). In metals or degenerate semiconductors

proximation),32,33) S/T is proportional to 1/n, where n is the
carrier concentration. The absolute value of S in x = 0.2 is 7.4
µV/K, which is the smallest value in the Ce-doped NdOBiS2.
With an increase in the Ce content x, the absolute value in-
creases, which corresponds to the increase in ρ(280 K). The
results show a decrease in the carrier density despite the in-
crease in the amount of Ce substitution. The behavior can be
understood by the changing ratio of Ce3+/Ce4+ depending on
the substitution amount, and the ratio of Ce4+ increases as the
x value decreases. In contrast, when the Ce concentration is
further increased above x = 0.5, the absolute value of S de-
creases. The decreasing S conﬂicts with the ρ(T) behavior in
CeOBiS2. Because the anomaly of ρ(T) is not similar to the
metallic or semiconducting behavior, there is a possibility that
the assumption of the metals or degenerate semiconductors is
inadequate in CeOBiS2.
Figures 4(a-b) show ρ(T) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 in several
magnetic ﬁelds applied along with ab and c. The upper critical
ﬁeld µ0Hc2(T) of Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 is obtained from the ρ(T)
measurements in several magnetic ﬁelds, as shown in Figs.
4(c-d). The superconductivity is signiﬁcantly suppressed with
increasing magnetic ﬁelds in both directions. ρ(T) above 3 T
shows a small hump at a low temperature point, which is not
reproducible.It is likely that the behaviors are not intrinsic. As
shown in Figs. 4(c-d), the dotted lines show the Werthamer–
Helfand–Hohenberg (WHH) theory prediction.34,35) In both
curves, the Hc2(T) curves deviate from the WHH prediction
and exhibit a positive curvature at around Tc. This behavior is
mainly attributed to spin-orbit coupling,35) multi-gap super-
conductivity,36,37) and strong electron–phonon coupling.38,39)
However, the origin of the positive curvature in the BiS2-

based superconductors still remains to be clariﬁed. A rea-
sonable ﬁt to the data for Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 can be obtained
using the expression Hc2(T) = Hc2(0)[1
(T/Tc)3/2]3/2.40)
This model was also used to ﬁt Hc2(T) for BiS2-based su-
perconductors,20,41) (Zr, Hf)IrSi,42) Nb0.18Re0.82,43) WRe3,44)
PbTaSe2,45) and high-entropy alloys.46) µ0Hc2(T) was deter-
mined as ∼12 T for the H || ab and ∼0.34 T for the H || c-axis.
In this article, we redetermined Hc2(T) of NdO0.7F0.3BiS2
from the same deﬁnition of Tc, as shown in Figs. 4(c-d). The
data were taken from the previous report.30) µ0Hc2(0) was de-
termined as ∼35 T for the H || ab and ∼0.78 T for the H ||
c-axis. These values are clearly larger than those of the Ce-
doped NdOBiS2. The results indicate that the µ0Hc2(0) for
both directions reduces in superconductivity induced by the
Ce-doping. Because measurements were performed above 2.0
K and above 9 T, lower temperature and higher ﬁeld measure-
ments were needed to determine the accurate Hc2 values of
the F- and Ce-doped NdOBiS2.
The anisotropic parameter Γ was determined using the
anisotropic Ginzburg–Landau (GL) formula,
Γ = mc

where mab, mc are the eﬀective masses, and ξab, ξc are the
GL-coherence lengths. ξab and ξc were evaluated using H||ab
c2
= Φ0/(2πξabξc) and H||c
c2 = Φ0/(2πξ2
ab), where Φ0 is the quan-
tum ﬂux. ξab and ξc were obtained as ∼86 and 0.31 nm
for Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2, respectively. The anisotropic param-
eter Γ was estimated to be ∼35. The result suggests that
the superconductivity possesses high anisotropy. The Γ of
NdO0.7F0.3BiS2 was recalculated to be ∼45. Because the dif-
ference in Γ is approximately 10, there is no considerable dif-
ference between F-doped and Ce-doped NdOBiS2.
In summary, we succeeded in growing a single crys-
tal of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 (x = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5). Plate-
like single crystals with dimensions of 0.8×0.8×0.2 mm3
were obtained. We discovered bulk superconductivity at Tc
= 4.7 K in a compound with x = 0.2. The lattice con-
stant of the c-axis decreased with an increase in Ce con-
tent x. The shrinking of the c-axis indicated the mixed va-
lency of Ce3+/Ce4+. It is likely that the superconductivity of
Nd1−xCexOBiS2 was induced by the electron doping of the
mixed valence of Ce3+/Ce4+. The superconducting transition
temperature of Ce-substituted Nd1−xCexOBiS2 was slightly
lower than that of F-substituted NdO1−xFxBiS2. This ten-
dency is also observed in Ce-substituted La1−xCexOBiSSe
and Ce1−xPrxOBiS2. ρ(T) of Nd1−xCexOBiS2 showed a metal-
lic behavior. In a compound with x = 0.5, a broad hump was
observed in ρ(T) at approximately 80 K, similar to that found
in CeOBiS2. The electrical resistivity of ρ(6 K) and ρ(280 K)
increased with increasing x. The tendency of S can be under-
stood by the increase of the Ce4+ ratio with decreasing Ce
content below x = 0.5. The upper critical ﬁeld µ0Hc2(T) of
Nd0.7Ce0.3OBiS2 was determined to be ∼12 T for H || ab and
∼0.34 T for H || c-axis. The anisotropic parameter Γ was es-
timated to be ∼35, which was comparable to that of F-doped
NdOBiS2. The µ0Hc2(0) of the Ce-doped NdOBiS2 was ap-
proximately two times smaller than that of the F-doped one,
although the diﬀerence of Γ was approximately 10. The re-
sults imply that the µ0Hc2(0) for both directions reduces in
superconductivity induced by Ce-doping. Our results for Ce-
doped NdOBiS2 make it possible to help understand super-
conductivity in BiS2-based superconductors.
